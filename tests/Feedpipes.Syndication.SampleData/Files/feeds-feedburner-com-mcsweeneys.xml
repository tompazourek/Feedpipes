      <title>I Am Running for President and My Message to the American People Is Simple: Please Don’t Yell at Me</title>
      <dc:creator>Bob Vulfov</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear America,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a candidate for President of the United States of America and I’m ready to inject this presidential race with some much-needed prudence, civility, and whiteness. My uncompelling centrist plans are exactly what the Democratic Party needs right now. In the face of a planet that’s burning up before our eyes, a population that’s trapped under the boot of the richest few, and concentration camps that are filled with children, I am here to scold progressive ideas on national television. I believe it’s my time to shine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I only ask one thing of you, my fellow Americans: please stop yelling at me. I don’t like it and it hurts my feelings. The only way we’re going to defeat Donald Trump is by letting my terrible, out-of-touch rhetoric gently exist without any pushback. If you disagree with me, then you’re an angry, radical socialist who should be arrested. I may be fully out of touch and running purely based on my own delusional hubris, but that doesn’t give you an excuse to raise your voice at me. I know I act tough, but please don’t yell at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Major political victories are never won through spirited debate, passion, and anger. True change is built on a strong foundation of middle-of-the-road cowardice. Some of the greatest political change of our time was accomplished by politely nodding. You can’t have anger in your voice during a political debate that’ll decide whether our country turns to dust or not. Give my horrible ideas a chance. If there’s a fire in a movie theater, I don’t want to hear that information yelled at me. Just calmly tell me there’s a fire and then I can propose a bipartisan solution where we all do nothing and end up dying in the fire. That’s the right way to do politics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When something is wrong in the world and great atrocities are being committed, there is only one reasonable way to respond: with dignified civility. I’m personally unaffected by the inequities of our social, political, and economic systems, so I think I’m the right person to lecture people on the proper tone we should all be taking. My life is basically an uninterrupted series of green lights, so take my word on it when I say there’s nothing to be angry about. Things are fine! Stop yelling. Specifically, stop yelling at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The major problem of our time is not the petulant racist currently sitting in the Oval Office. Nor is it the fact that our planet is burning up like a birthday candle and we’re doing nothing about it. No, the major problem we have to address is me getting yelled at by people. If you care so much about something that you resort to yelling to convey your point, then I cannot relate to you. I’ve lived my whole life calmly avoiding eye contact when confronted with suffering and I don’t intend to stop now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone who proposes structural change with even a hint of emotion in their voice is a radical. What America needs right now is a rational leader who’s ready to quietly mutter “Oh boy” when faced with unspeakable horrors. I am that leader. Please don’t yell at me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Maura Quint’s Presidential Debate Recaps: The One Where Everyone Goes After Biden</title>
      <dc:creator>Maura Quint</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;2020 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEMOCRATIC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEBATE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DETROIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JULY&lt;/span&gt; 31, 2019&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:13 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Jake Tapper explains the rules and asks that candidates refrain from interrupting. Candidates nod and take notes, sizing up which fellow candidates they’re going to first interrupt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:15 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; In opening statements, the candidates position themselves. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang says he’s the opposite of Trump. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he’s the opposite of Biden and Harris. New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand says she’s the opposite of a man, and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet said he’s the opposite of a sock. As New Jersey Senator Cory Booker is about to hug each moderator individually, protestors interrupt the debate, chanting something that sounded like “pants of mayo,” which is an issue that probably will not get addressed this evening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:27 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The debate begins with a question on healthcare. California Senator Kamala Harris and Former Vice President Joe Biden lock eyes, Harris circles him, the lights dim on all but the two of them when suddenly de Blasio pops up in between them and asks what the hell they’re even talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:30 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; De Blasio emphatically states that Medicare for All is necessary and asks why the other candidates are fear-mongering about universal healthcare. Bennet says he’s doing no such thing, it’s just important that Americans know that Medicare for All would also potentially improve the health of clowns who live in sewers and demons that try to murder you in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:34 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; When asked if she supports Medicare for All, Kirsten Gillibrand hesitates then agrees she believes every American should be able to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIVE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUGH&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOVE&lt;/span&gt;. In response, Senator Harris lobs a water balloon at Biden. Though it hits him directly on the shoulder, it’s unclear whether he notices. Hawaii Senator Tulsi Gabbard picks up a similar balloon and throws it at Harris, but it only splashes at her feet. Harris, never looking down, seamlessly slips on a pair of dry heels behind her podium. They all agree they’d be better than Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:37 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, in response to being asked his position on a public option, pulls out a bag of homemade trail mix and asks if anyone wants a snack because he brought enough for the whole stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:51 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Moderator Don Lemon turns the discussion to immigration, asking if decriminalizing border crossings would make it seem the border is open to all. Former Secretary of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HUD&lt;/span&gt; Julian Castro turns to a whiteboard behind him titled, &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TALKING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POINTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, writes &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BORDERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; below it, and then shakes his head disapprovingly at the moderators for 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:52 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Michael Bennet states that immigration is personal to him because his mother is an immigrant who escaped the Nazis, which is why he thinks we shouldn’t let people into this country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:54 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Gillibrand opens up with a story she heard from her Pilates instructor during a week-long yoga retreat and emphasizes the importance of women and children. Andrew Yang says, &amp;#8220;Speaking of immigrants&amp;#8230;,&amp;#8221; and pulls out a PowerPoint presentation that is slide after slide of the same image: a stack of 1000 one-dollar bills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:56 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Biden is asked about the fact that more immigrants were deported under Obama than during Trump’s first two years of presidency. Protestors interrupt the debate to reiterate this fact in a more confusing manner. Biden laughs and then says, &amp;#8220;Well, Castro was in Obama’s administration too!&amp;#8221; Castro pulls out a water balloon and lobs it at Biden. As the water cascades down Biden’s forehead, Castro replies, “One of us has learned the lessons of the past and one hasn’t.” Biden responds by throwing his hands up and making a “would you look at this guy” face to the audience, who tries not to make eye contact in return.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:04 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Tulsi Gabbard is asked if she believes we should give free college to undocumented immigrants. She says no, we need to fix our immigration system and solve student debt. De Blasio replies, &amp;#8220;Mhm, that’s nice &amp;#8212; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANSWER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUESTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABOUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBAMA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIDEN&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; Biden responds with, &amp;#8220;I don’t kiss and tell.&amp;#8221; Booker shrugs, picks up a water balloon, says, &amp;#8220;I’m sorry,&amp;#8221; and then hurls it at Biden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:15 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Jake Tapper walks onto the stage with a bucket of water balloons and hands out more to each candidate, then asks about criminal justice. Biden looks around nervously as Booker shrugs again, picks up another balloon and says, alright then, let’s tangle. Biden picks up a water balloon, but fumbles it and it breaks all over his pants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:17 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Castro turns to Bill de Blasio and says that the officer who killed Eric Garner should be off the street. De Blasio says “it’s Biden’s fault!” Biden says “I’m friends with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBAMA&lt;/span&gt;! He liked me and if you don’t like me then that means you hate Obama!” Yang offers him $1000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:19 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Harris is asked if her record on busing is the same as Biden’s. She says absolutely not. Biden claps his hands and exclaims “Oh boy!” Harris turns to him with an expression of pure disgust. While her back is turned, Tulsi Gabbard rapid fires five water balloons at her shoulder blades, all direct hits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:37 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The debate now turns to climate change. Inslee says we’ve run out of time. Biden replies, &amp;#8220;How long do any of us have to live anyway?&amp;#8221; Yang agrees that we are already too late but with $1000 everyone could possibly engineer their own rocketships and maybe do some sort of &lt;i&gt;Interstellar&lt;/i&gt; thing, or maybe Martians want $1000 to trade planets or something? Biden laughs and says “I like this Asian fella, anyway coal got us into this mess, and coal can get us out.” Inslee responds by going from podium to podium, taking a water balloon and smashing it in each candidate’s face while calmly stating, “This is the world and this is what your nonsense plans are going to do it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:49 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Biden is asked what he says to claims that he’s not progressive enough. Biden replies, &amp;quot;That’s baloney. Next, these whippersnappers will be saying that befriending financial institutions isn’t progressive enough when there’s an insurance company &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CALLED&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8216;Progressive.&amp;#8217;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:05 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Tapper turns to Bennet and asks, “In less than 60 seconds and using only words found in Bob Dylan hits, no deep cuts, can you please tell us in detail how you would balance disruptions created by technology with its beneficial impact on our economy?” The candidates all agree they’re better than Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:32 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Closing statements are made:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DE &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLASIO&lt;/span&gt;: (&lt;i&gt;Holds up a&lt;/i&gt; &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SANDERS&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WARREN&lt;/span&gt; 2020&lt;/small&gt; sign&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BENNET&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;While I am a muppet being operated by a team of puppeteers, I am, still, incredibly lifelike.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INSLEE&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;Vote for me or the world will explode in a fireball by the end of the decade, but no big deal, your call.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GILLIBRAND&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;As your president, I would say to you, &amp;#8216;Now watch me sip, on chardonnay-nay.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GABBARD&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;Vote for me or continue to live in a fantasy world of imagined safety, you ridiculous automatons.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CASTRO&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;I should have gotten to be part of last night&amp;#8217;s debate instead. Adios.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YANG&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;I think I’ve demonstrated that, like the most boring finance guy cornering you at a party you got suckered into going to, I can make any topic a reference to me having $1000.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOOKER&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;We need to beat Donald Trump with friendship. As your President, I will know all the cutest animal gifs and I will always text you back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HARRIS&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;I’m a prosecutor and I promise to put this country’s problems in jail. Except for the problem of jails.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIDEN&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;I’m wet and I don’t remember what I came up here for, where are my glasses. Do I wear glasses? Like my best friend Obama used to say, &amp;#8216;Together, we can wear glasses.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>List: When Celebrity Chefs Egg Your House</title>
      <dc:creator>Timothy Cahill</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;Jacques Pepin&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Runs up to your house, cracks three eggs into a bowl, whisks them with a fork (Jacques always uses a fork), neatly places the bowl on your doorstep, rings the doorbell. As you open the door, he throws chives, parsley, tarragon and a hint of chevril at your face. He scampers off into the night shout-whispering “Oh mon ami! Mon ami!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Emeril Lagasse&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carefully breaks into your house, sneaks into your bedroom, hangs sausage links around your canopy bed frame, fires up a hot plate, and starts making an eight-ingredient omelet. Each time he adds a new ingredient he whispers “Bam” a little louder, eventually waking you with one loud “Bam!” Once you’re awake, he jumps out the window, leaving everything behind. Your bedroom has never smelled so good. You crack a wry smile and lie there ensconced in olfactory bliss, ready to take on the first day of the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Alton Brown&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tunnels his way underground from his home to yours. While directly below your home he decides to improvise and poach your house instead of egg it. After spending months building a gigantic whirlpool water cauldron below your home, he recruits Wylie Dufresne to place C4 charges that look like donuts around the foundation. Once you click your bedside light off and fall asleep, he fires them off, sending you and your two-story home into Alton’s Whirlpool Water Cauldron. It’s filled with a boatload of kosher salt and super-premium white vinegar. You swirl around for five minutes until a timer goes off. You and your house don’t even come close to being poached. Alton and Wylie storm off, very upset, very unsuccessful, and very broke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Rachael Ray&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shows up at your house on the night of a supermoon. Rachael doesn’t throw eggs but instead soaks your dog in E-V-O-O while shouting “DELISH!” at the top of her lungs. When the outdoor sensor light goes on, she cowers and runs off down the street, dumping E-V-O-O on her own head, shouting “YUM-O!!” at the top of her lungs. Your neighbors call the cops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Robert Irvine&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Approaches your house with one arm cocked ready to launch cage-free, farm-fresh, organic eggs, but stops when something catches his eye. It’s the shoddy craftsmanship and lackluster paint job on your bay window shutters. Robert rings your doorbell, wakes you up, and demands to know who did the bulk of the exterior work on your home. You tell him “I think it was McCarthy &amp;amp; Sons Home Improvement but I’m not 100% sure.” He asks you to accompany him to McCarthy &amp;amp; Sons Home Improvement, located 10 miles from your home. You go and sheepishly stare at your feet while Robert berates every worker he meets, citing problematic layouts, passé paint swatches, disrespectful molding, and basic carpentry mishaps as their litany of failings. You feel like a child in trouble for something you didn’t do. Robert leaves without you. You sigh deeply and question your life’s path on your way back home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Julia Child’s Ghost (&amp;amp; Company)&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy Adams, Meryl Streep, Nora Ephron’s ghost, and Julia Child’s ghost ring your doorbell in the middle of the night. You wake up, open the door, discreetly read the situation, and ever-so politely ask them if they’d like to come in. Once they’re inside you bolt to the pantry where you keep your emergency Ghostbusters lever. You pull it and breathe a deep sigh of relief, thinking you’ve just alerted the correct enforcement group designed to deal with celebrity ghost vandals exactly like this. However, it didn’t work &amp;#8212; Ephron and Child were on to you before you knew it and dismantled the Ghosbusters lever while you were sleeping. Ephron and Child then proceed to tie you to a kitchen chair and place multiple colanders on your head. They hover with folded arms while Adams and Streep take turns cracking eggs on the colanders. But since there are multiple colanders on your head, the eggs don’t really go through them and instead end up sliding all over your shoulders, and down the back of your shirt, and getting in and around your shoes and maybe even a little inside your socks. Julia quietly repeats the phrase “If you’re afraid of butter, use cream” over and over and over again in a polite but ghoulish tone. It’s fucking maddening and you wish you were dead. This continues until daybreak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Guy Fieri&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heads to the store and attempts to buy eggs but can’t. Guy hates eggs. Instead, he wheels his Steamin’ Pork Scooter &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBQ&lt;/span&gt; Canon over to your yard and fires it at your house. Once your windows are doused with Guy’s Rootin’ Tootin’ Kansas City Blurbin’ Bourbon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBQ&lt;/span&gt; Sauce he plants a sign in your yard that says: &lt;small&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; IS &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLAVORTOWN&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POPULATION&lt;/span&gt;: ME&lt;/small&gt;. You don’t hate the sign and decide to leave it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Mature Are You? A Quiz</title>
      <dc:creator>Chelsea Stickle</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Circle the answer that best fits your response. Be honest!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h4&gt;1. When a co-worker steals your lunch, you:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A) Emit a guttural scream. Ask, &amp;#8220;What man committed this crime?!&amp;#8221; Lecture the entire office on boundaries. Your bark is worse than your bite, but they don&amp;#8217;t know that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B) Hunt down the motherfucker who ate your pastrami sandwich. Tell him to keep his hand at the level of his eye when he walks to the parking garage tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C) Go home. Take a nap under a blanket fort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;D) Find the person eating your lunch, and tell him that if he wanted you to make him a sandwich, all he had to do was ask. You’d be more than happy to pack for two sometimes! Maybe Fridays?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E) Remind everyone that you labeled your stuff. For the next few days go out for lunch. Watch the thief wither without your delicious food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;2. When that bitch in your book club calls you a space cadet, you:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A) Tell her to fuck off. You know you want to! You’ve been so patient with her hater ass. You deserve a little release!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B) Stab her hand with a salad fork. Shatter a metacarpal. Feel how your ancestors must have felt when they conquered worlds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C) Freeze and replay everything you’ve ever said or done that could make her think that. Sift through hours and hours of footage. By the time you remember you’re in a room full of people, no one remembers what she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;D) Tell her she’s right! You are &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; spacey. You should probably work on that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E) Ignore her. This can look like C, but it is an intentional act.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;3. When a friend asks for help moving &lt;br /&gt; even though she knows you have back problems, you:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A) Call her a shitty friend. Why can’t she remember the basics about you! What is wrong with her?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B) Slap her until she remembers that you’re always in pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C) Tell her you’re busy that day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;D) Help her and injure yourself but don’t say anything. Spend hundreds of dollars on chiropractor treatments just to get back to your normal pain level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E) Remind her that you can’t lift. Offer to bring bagels or lunch to make her move more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;4. When your mother obsesses over the weight you’ve gained &lt;br /&gt; since your high school graduation fifteen years ago, you:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A) Call her a bitch. Who else would randomly talk about your body without prompting? Tell her we can’t all have eating disorders, Karen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B) It’s mostly muscle. Cardio kickboxing is going really well. Tell her that the next time you see her you can kick her ass until she gets the right idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C) Say nothing. You can feel your healthy dinner rapidly putrefying in your stomach. But it’s a free country. You can’t tell her what she can and can’t say. That would be fascist. She’s entitled to her opinion. Even when it makes you cry in the shower before work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;D) Tell her she’s right. You have gained weight, but you’re working on it. You&amp;#8217;re going to the gym five days a week and eating healthy. Your body changed. You’re trying to do better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E) You didn’t ask for her opinion, and you don’t want it. Tell her if she can’t say anything nice, she shouldn’t say anything at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;5. When your boyfriend says he wants to move in, &lt;br /&gt; but you&amp;#8217;re not ready, you:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A) Pick a fight. How could you move in with someone who still can’t manage to clean the sink after shaving? You’ve asked him a million times. It’s like he doesn’t even care enough to try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B) Throw him out. A window, the front door. Whatever’s closest to the garbage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C) Break up with him. Don’t tell him why. You obviously want different things and talking about it will only muddy the waters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;D) Tell him yes, yes, a million times yes! Feel that pebble in your stomach grow into a boulder gathering speed down a hill toward an elementary school. Never voice your doubts or reveal your newfound anxiety-related constipation. It will only make him worry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E) Tell him that his lease being up isn&amp;#8217;t a good reason to move in together. You told him you needed space after the miscarriage. No more secretly picking out names or looking up just how big it would be. A poppy seed. A blueberry. A green olive. You were going to throw away all your future plans for him and an apple seed. Without the apple seed, moving in together seems like the rash act it would be. You haven’t even known each other that long. Four months. You want to be smart. You hope he can respect that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Results:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mostly As&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You may have some issues around impulsivity and aggression that you should look into with a qualified therapist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mostly Bs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Physical abuse isn&amp;#8217;t cute. Get yourself to anger management before a court mandates it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mostly Cs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bottling up all your feelings isn’t healthy, and hiding from the world won’t solve your problems. You need to learn how to draw boundaries and ask for what you want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mostly Ds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There’s something called “fawning” that you might want to look into. Stop catering to other people so much! You are responsible for your own happiness, not everyone else’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mostly Es&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Congratulations! You&amp;#8217;re basically a zen master! You don&amp;#8217;t need that lavender bubble bath, but maybe run it anyway? Check out this new bath bomb from our sponsor! You deserve it for dealing with A&amp;#8217;s, B&amp;#8217;s, C&amp;#8217;s, and D’s bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Maura Quint’s Presidential Debate Recaps: The One Where Everyone Dunks</title>
      <dc:creator>Maura Quint</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;2020 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEMOCRATIC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEBATE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIGHT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DETROIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JULY&lt;/span&gt; 30, 2019&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:03 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Jake Tapper, Dana Bash, and Don Lemon welcome the audience and set up ground rules, stating that they’re going to try a brand new approach to debate where they each serve as something like a “moderator” who asks candidates “questions,” which the candidates then might attempt to “answer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:05 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The National Anthem is played to test candidates ability to stand back up if they take a knee, but no one falls for it. Tim Ryan does not put his hand over his heart but this appears to be less of a protest than of acknowledgment that he does not know where his heart is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:13 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The candidates give their opening statements, collectively agreeing that they forgot to mention during the last debate that Trump is bad. Everyone who is not Senator Bernie Sanders or Senator Elizabeth Warren reminds viewers that they are not Senator Sanders or Warren. Sanders and Warren agree that others are not them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:23 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Jake Tapper begins the debate by asking about Medicare for All and explaining that all of tonight’s questions were specially crafted from a page of Republican talking points they found lying in the alley behind Fox News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:25 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Former Maryland Representative John Delaney stakes the night’s first claim to being the most Republican by declaring Medicare for All “bad policy.” Sanders counters with “You’re wrong,” and one of Delaney’s arms falls off. Delaney smiles in confusion. Warren high-fives Sanders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:30 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Tapper asks Senator Warren that he’s heard she hates middle-class families and wants to hurt them, isn’t that true? Warren calmly picks up a glass of water, takes one sip and then flings the rest of the water in Tapper’s face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:34 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Former Governor of Montana Steve Bullock, who did not qualify for the first Democratic primary debates, attempts to stand out from the crowd by explaining, “Healthcare is personal. Like, I’m personally very rich and that’s good for me. Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:35 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar states that she’s different because she is from the Midwest, which is a region of the country the other candidates have probably never heard of. She challenges them to even name one place in the Midwest. South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg starts to raise his hand and Klobuchar throws a large brick of butter at him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:37 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Delaney attempts to take back the stage by asserting he’s the only candidate in the healthcare business. Sanders interrupts with “It’s not a business,” and Delaney’s other arm falls off. Delaney smiles in confusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:39 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Tapper turns to author Marianne Williamson and asks how she responds to criticism she’s received from Warren. Williamson, pulls out some sage, lights it on fire, waves it in front of her and responds that criticism is a negative energy that does not align with her own personal chakras. Tapper explains he really only meant the question hypothetically and would prefer if she didn’t answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:41 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg pauses, arranges the pens on his podium, and narrows his eyes. He begins slowly, “It’s time to stop worrying what the Republicans will say.” A basketball net is wheeled onto the stage next to him and he is handed a ball. “The Republicans will call us socialists no matter what, so we should just support the best policy.” He effortlessly dunks the ball and crowd cheers. Marianne Williamson pours kombucha on his head in celebration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:44 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; Ohio Representative Tim Ryan, concerned he might not be coming across as the most Republican, attacks Bernie Sanders by saying the Vermont senator doesn’t know for sure that Medicare for All will be comprehensive. Bernie sips from his coffee as a stagehand runs out and moves the basketball net directly over Ryan. Bernie calmly picks up the ball, writes “I know, I wrote the damn bill” on it, then slam dunks it in Ryan’s face. The crowd cheers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:46 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The debate now turns to decriminalizing immigration and candidates are asked if that will encourage more illegal immigration. Buttigieg, still buzzed from his dunk, responds, “I feel like you don’t understand what words mean.” Former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke recognizes a distant call to something his team spent days trying to prep him on and jumps in with, “I disagree.” Senator Warren states that criminalization of immigration is what allows Trump to take children away from their parents. Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper counters with, “Well, can’t we just not do anything you guys are talking about, but just somehow make stuff not be that way?” Warren coughs in a way that sounds vaguely like, “UH, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YEAH&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THROUGH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DECRIMINILIZATION&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOAD&lt;/span&gt;.” Marianne Williamson hands her an herbal tea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:52 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The moderators again ask if we make this country better with free healthcare and free college, won’t everyone come here? Don’t you think we should start some sort of a gulag system so they stay away? Sanders responds, “No,” just as Bullock responds with “This is a really good idea, thank you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:56 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The debate now turns to gun violence. The group agrees guns are incredibly bad so we should absolutely immediately take some tiny steps to vaguely address them in some minor way, except for Bullock who, when asked, says, “Hey! look! Something over there!” and ducks beneath his podium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:11 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; As the debate continues, pitting the progressives against the moderates, the now armless Delaney, with incredible pride, slams Warren for her “fairytale economics.” From what seems to be the rafters, a deep voice echoes through the auditorium “FINISH HIM” and Warren reaches under her red jacket, pulls a long sword and slices Delaney entirely in half. Everyone pauses. The voice again echoes “FLAWLESS VICTORY” after which Klobuchar explains that she&amp;#8217;s from the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:23 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; On climate change, Bullock asks, “Have we thought about seeing what the Republicans want to do?” Ryan and Delaney’s disembodied head each scowl at not having suggested that first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:40 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The candidates are asked if they’d support reparations and give some tepid answers until Marianne Williamson, whose bee pollen shot just kicked in, emphatically expresses that reparations are not assistance they are a debt owed. The stagehand, with some surprise, moves the basketball hoop near her and hands her the ball. She wraps the basketball in a lavender silk scarf and cradles it tenderly. The audience, though confused, cheers anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:03 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; As the candidates discuss student loan debt and Bernie explains his proposal, Klobuchar argues that she’s from the Midwest and rich people shouldn’t get free things unless they’re also farmers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:29 PM:&lt;/strong&gt; The candidates give their closing statements:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BULLOCK&lt;/span&gt;: I&amp;#8217;m running for president to give every American the feeling of being stuck talking to the awkward person at the cocktail party who can’t quite get out a full sentence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILLIAMSON&lt;/span&gt;: I will heal the country with love and crystals and please don’t google anything else I’ve said in the past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DELANEY&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JFK&lt;/span&gt; famously said that if I quote a Democrat you&amp;#8217;ll forget I&amp;#8217;m a Republican&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RYAN&lt;/span&gt;: I hope I captured your imagination &amp;#8212; captured it and let it slowly die as I whispered to it that nothing can be done to save us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HICKENLOOPER&lt;/span&gt;: What a night. I&amp;#8217;ve loved it. I&amp;#8217;m laughing, actually. Ask yourself, do you want someone who just talks or someone who&amp;#8217;s already given up all their ideals?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KLOBUCHAR&lt;/span&gt;: Well, that’s the news from the debate, where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above-average.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O&amp;#8217;ROURKE: (&lt;i&gt;quietly sings Radiohead’s &amp;#8220;Creep&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUTTIGIEG&lt;/span&gt;: Was this the loser night? I don’t think so but, was it? Who do I speak to about also talking tomorrow night?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WARREN&lt;/span&gt;: (&lt;i&gt;walks to Sanders, clasps hands and they raise them triumphantly&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SANDERS&lt;/span&gt;: (&lt;i&gt;with hand still raised, he nods and yells&lt;/i&gt;) Did I mention the 1%?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We Can’t Risk Losing to Donald Trump By Believing In Anything</title>
      <dc:creator>Chandler Dean</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard a lot of big ideas tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this election shouldn’t be about who can run furthest to the left. It should be about who can run furthest away from any firm commitments just in case they upset any upper middle class suburban white voters who I’ve decided are the only people who could swing this election.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Listen, I’m as progressive as anyone else on this stage. I just think that we don’t have to implement progressive policies to make progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our number one priority should be defeating Donald Trump. And we’re not going to do it by making crazy, untenable promises we’ll never be able to keep. Instead, we should be pragmatic, which is why my plan is to do absolutely nothing different and assume things will change as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medicare for All might sound like a great idea in theory. I’ll even concede that it’s a great idea in practice. But you can’t just go and kick tens of millions of Americans off of their health insurance simply because you’re replacing it with something that’s objectively way better. That’s like if Apple wanted to give you a brand-new iPhone Xs free of charge, but it meant you had to give up a 2004 Nokia flip phone you currently pay $175 a month for. Why not let people choose between cutting edge technology and the thrill of playing Snake on a 1.5-inch screen?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing I know about this country, it’s that people love their existing health insurance coverage. That’s the hill I have chosen to die on. By the way, I’m dying on a hill in the first place in an effort to relate to people who exist under our current healthcare system. For now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget about the unions. Over the course of so many decades, unions have fought tooth and nail to get employer-sponsored health insurance. So what, now these American workers are gonna elect some socialist, and all they’ll have to show for it is the freedom to stop relying on a tenuous job that could disappear at any second for their children’s health coverage? That’s not the America I know. And something reminding me of the America I know makes it good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are facing an existential crisis in climate change. And we need to boldly respond to that crisis with the sort of approach that I take when facing any crisis: tax subsidies and rebates and closing loopholes. Why put out a fire with water when you can form a commission to incentivize small businesses to engage in water-adjacent practices?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also have some thoughts about reparations, but I’m going to keep quiet about that until after the South Carolina primary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard from a lot of voters over the last few months. From the blue-collar pharmaceutical executives who fund my campaign, to the scrappy Wall Street investors who fund my campaign, to the aspirational oil tycoons who fund my campaign. And they all say the same thing &amp;#8212; which I will not disclose because those conversations are confidential, and you will never truly know what I assure my most influential donors behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But here’s what I told them I would tell you: We cannot defeat Donald Trump if we alienate the people who are almost certainly going to vote for Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last thing we want is a repeat of 2016, when Hillary Clinton lost. In deciding to run for president, I have spent hours lying awake, racking my brain to determine why that happened. And I’ve come up with an answer. It wasn’t because of Hillary Clinton’s moderate policies, or a message relying upon preserving the status quo &amp;#8212; that all works great for me. It’s because Hillary Clinton wasn’t me personally. Meanwhile, I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; me personally. So you can see that there’s a fundamental difference at play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of my opponents believe that the way to win is to appeal to our better angels. But I know just as well as anyone that – as has always been the case &amp;#8212; this election will be won by stoking fear in our worst cowards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nominate me, and you’ll be sending a candidate to the debate stage who will look Donald Trump straight in the eye and say, without hesitation: “the American people demand a president who is superficially a marginal change from the current president.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike some of the other people on this stage, I know I can keep my promises. Because I’ve promised nothing. And I have a proven record of doing that for my entire career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Took the “Discover Your Patronus” Test On Pottermore and Got Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy</title>
      <dc:creator>Keith James</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a lull during work last Wednesday. Using my work computer, I proceeded to goof around on the internet and managed to get access to Pottermore, a public internet site for Harry Potter related content. I’ve been reading a lot of Harry Potter to my grandchildren. The moments I get with my grandchildren are wonderful. Harry Potter’s parents were brutally murdered, but I can still find bits of laughter on each page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found a section on the site that houses personality-based quiz applications, one being an application that feeds user opinions about inanimate objects into an undefined algorithm and calculates what animal form their patronus would take. A patronus is a spectral figure that secretes from the tip of a wizard wand. It acts similar to how an antidepressant would, but you can choose to leverage your patronus against things that are not yourself. I enjoy fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I time-boxed this quiz activity and completed the task well within the budgeted time. It was an easy quiz; my youngest grandson could complete this quiz with minimal instruction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the flash animation was completed I saw the image of my patronus. It was Senator Patrick Leahy from Vermont. I sent a quick email to my oldest grandson to confirm the types of patronuses he and his younger brothers had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;One dog (terrier)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One otter (river)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One dolphin (sea)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further questioning exposed that not one of his friends’ patronuses was a sitting United States Senator, or even congressman for that matter. I ended the email discussion with my grandson and logged off my computer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought the situation of having Patrick Leahy as my patronus was quite interesting, because I am also a United States senator. I work with Patrick. He and I are both on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. He seems like a nice enough guy. A virtuous, hard-working man. Honestly, I haven’t had the chance to get to know him because we’ve just been so darn busy these past few years. But this new information warranted a discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I met Senator Leahy in the break room just after a Perspectives on Child Nutrition Reauthorization Full Committee Hearing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patrick, I’m Senator Debbie Stabenow from Michigan. I took an online personality assessment that determines the form a person’s patronus takes. The assessment determined that you are my patronus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Leahy became red in the ears, as if this information made him embarrassed. He could not keep eye contact. I allowed him to collect his thoughts. After some time, he spoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve got to be honest with you, Debbie. I took that internet quiz, too. And you’re my patronus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a curious situation. A little comical even.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We fucked really, really hard that day. He felt so bad afterwards that he called his wife from my bedroom phone. I cut the telephone cord before he could apologize to his wife and I can’t seem to remember why I did that. All I remember is walking to my bedroom window and staring at the Capitol Building until morning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I haven’t taken another test on Pottermore, but I’d sure like to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Moderate’s Guide to Winning the 2020 Election</title>
      <dc:creator>Dan Berger</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We can win in 2020 and turn back the tide of this monstrous regime. But only if we play our cards exactly right, starting now. Here’s a surefire path to victory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T get distracted.&lt;/strong&gt; I know there’s a lot going on. Sure Trump is given tons of free air time by a spectacle-loving media, but we’ve got to be laser-focused on what counts. Don’t get distracted by inequality, court-packing, or the hastening pace of climate change. From candidate to president, Donald Trump is really about one thing. I forget what it is, but next time you get riled up about your health care being taken away while your neighbor loses her right to vote, I will remind you not to get distracted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO focus on words, not actions.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes we will have to respond to something the president tweets. But let’s leave it there. His actions are too depressing to oppose. Yes, every second of this administration is a full-frontal assault on already weak democratic institutions, climate protections, and basic human decency. But our descent into authoritarianism would not be so objectionable if he acted with a little more decorum. And who’s to say you can’t teach a 73-year-old racist billionaire with a long track record of racist and sexual harassment some manners?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T bring up old stuff.&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, every single day the president violates the emoluments clause while a slew of his advisors/family members commit routine ethics violations. And sure, there was recently yet another credible accusation of rape against him. But Americans don’t want to be reminded of icky things. Just look at the Iraq War: a cabal of political apparatchiks lied repeatedly to stoke a global war that has killed, traumatized, and displaced millions; destabilized the Middle East that has prompted refugee crises that have, in turn, been seized upon by authoritarian nativists around the world; and given rise to more dangerous extremist organizations. We didn’t hold any of the chief architects responsible for that; hell, we barely held a few low-level soldiers responsible for committing war crimes. And that worked out fine: all of those people have cushy jobs in government, industry, and lobbying firms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO fight for every vote of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; opinion page.&lt;/strong&gt; Winning their approval is our party’s highest priority. We don’t even have to pay attention to all 14; it’s not like Jamelle Bouie or Michelle Goldberg are gonna vote Republican. No, we’re really focused on three, maybe four people: David “Elites Rule, Proles Drool” Brooks, Maureen &amp;#8220;Yo No Soy Proletariat&amp;#8221; Dowd, Thomas “I Want a High Wall With a Big Gate” Friedman, and Bret “White Nationalist But It’s Cool Cuz He Speaks Spanish” Stephens. Even Ross “I’ve Been Owned By the Onanists” Douthat inveigles against the Left enough to warrant a good listen. They just seem like cool peeps you wanna have a chilled white wine with, and we have to respect our long track record of appealing to the right by attacking the left, then losing to far more reactionary forces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T set the agenda.&lt;/strong&gt; The president and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOP&lt;/span&gt; are savvy media manipulators; they know how to dominate the news cycle. The best thing we can do is to let them. Stay away from bold plans and don’t even try to reframe the debate. Every time we say one little thing, they go wild for weeks attacking and distorting us. It’s best to just let them have at it. Be sure that 90 percent of what we do is responding to 10 percent of what they do. Our motto must be “React, React, React.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO pine for the &amp;#8220;Good Old Days.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve got to get back to the way things were &amp;#8212; not the 1890s, like the Republicans want. And definitely not the 1930s, when a Democratic President implemented urgently needed and wildly popular policies that secured Democratic rule for decades. But to a more reasonable time, like the 1970s, when we abandoned unions and racial justice for corporate interests and reasonable backlash. Or maybe the 1990s, when we helped conservatives gut welfare, expand mass incarceration and bolster nativism. Or definitely the early 2010s, when we oversaw a record number of both deportations and Democratic Party lost seats nationwide. Obama’s message of hope and change inspired millions of people to believe that they could do something to make the country reflect their values and needs &amp;#8212; and many were devastated when it was replaced with humdrum technocrats, bank bailouts, and obstinate backlash. The lesson? Viva la technocracy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T talk about identity (too much).&lt;/strong&gt; There are precisely three acceptable moments to invoke identity: 1) when discussing your own hardscrabble roots, real or imagined; 2) when you’re trying to not-so-secretly assure white people that you won’t jeopardize the value of their home by making them live in integrated neighborhoods or send their kids to integrated schools; and 3) when you’re protecting centrist policies or politicians from progressive challenges&amp;#8212;in that situation, go ahead and throw in a hand-clap emoji or some teen slang. Otherwise, stick to bland platitudes about “hard-working Americans&amp;quot; and the &amp;#8220;middle class.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO value bipartisanship.&lt;/strong&gt; Voters like bipartisanship over results &amp;#8212; our consultants assure us of this. The people will appreciate how respectfully we have let Mitch McConnell appoint a record number of troglodytes to lifetime judicial appointments. Already I can hear the chorus of thank-yous: from the 42-year-old mother lying on her death bed after being refused medical coverage for a pre-existing condition (and when she was &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; close to paying back her student loans too), or the family of four evicted for being unable to repay their predatory loan to the multinational bank we never prosecuted, or the octogenarian couple losing their Meals on Wheels, or the 24-year-old etching another year into the wall of his prison cell after losing his first and last appeal. It’s called “teamwork,” folks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T do anything too political.&lt;/strong&gt; Since we won back the House in 2018, it’s been super fun pretending to be a coequal branch of government. We’ve sent out subpoenas, held hearings, and everything! Unfortunately, some of those hearings have been to empty chairs because this administration has boycotted them. But we’ve held our ground and refused to hold them accountable. We won’t sink down to their level by using the power we have at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO be civil above all else.&lt;/strong&gt; Except when it comes to socialists, of course. Stopping them is our biggest priority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, Dems, follow these steps, and we are on a surefire path to victory in 2020 &amp;#8212; a Republican victory, mind you, but a victory all the same. Now get out there and don’t raise hell!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Puerto Ricans Are Ready and Available to Help Force Trump’s Resignation</title>
      <dc:creator>Ricardo Herrera Bandrich</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing the world knows after &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/24/20703901/puerto-rico-protests-governor-resigns"&gt;roughly two weeks of historic mass protests forced Puerto Rico’s governor to resign&lt;/a&gt;, it’s that you don’t fuck with us Puerto Ricans. Especially if you’re a politician who callously &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/us/puerto-rico-governor-rossello-private-chats/index.html"&gt;talks shit&lt;/a&gt; about basically everyone: hurricane victims, women in power, political opponents, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt; community, the poor, the press, anyone who’s not a mirror of you. And especially if you &amp;#8212; like &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/04/how-corporate-lobbyists-conquered-american-democracy/390822/"&gt;many others before you&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; get a kick out of turning your office into &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/opinion/trump-administration-corruption-conflicts.html"&gt;a cesspool of corruption&lt;/a&gt; while others are struggling or not born with a silver spoon in their mouths. We could go on and on, but we don’t want to lose focus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unless you’re naturally deluded or treat lies like afterthoughts, you know that, after Hurricane María struck Puerto Rico, Trump became one of the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-puerto-rico_n_5d3608d9e4b020cd9947ad21"&gt;worst things that ever happened to the island&lt;/a&gt; for way too many reasons to list here. In fact, if we could build a spaceship in the shape of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/12/646997771/fact-check-puerto-rico-was-an-incredible-unsung-success"&gt;a roll of paper towel&lt;/a&gt;, transform its interior into a tanning bed that never shuts off, and convert tweets into rocket fuel, we would do it in a heartbeat and send him back to the alternate reality from which he came. So just imagine how huge and awesome our peaceful protests against Trump would also be!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s a taste of what we can bring to the Trump butt-kicking table.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;We go way beyond placards and chants&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you think rallies are only about carrying signs, chanting, and being entirely surrounded by angry people, then boy are you in for a surprise!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If something can be done by more than one person at a time by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/puerto-rico-governor-ricky-renuncia.html"&gt;land, sea, or air&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows something about who we are, and it&amp;#8217;s game for a protest. This includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mass cavalcades, yoga protests, and performance art shows&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SusanSoltero/status/1153067438025728002?s=20"&gt;Scuba divers&lt;/a&gt; rallying underwater near &lt;i&gt;bacalaos&lt;/i&gt; and other fish.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Aerial silk dancers dangling from highway signs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Huge fleets of motorcycles, bicycles, and ATVs. Jet skis, kayaks, and paddleboards will also be used, especially if Trump or his comrades are within shouting distance from the water or Melania is trying to escape again on his yacht&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Our music and dancing are next level&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether we’re chanting or dancing at New York’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1153472864395452416?s=20"&gt;Grand Central Terminal&lt;/a&gt; or singing folk songs or turning folk songs into protest chants that somehow incorporate the words Trump, Russia, and Trussia into rhymes, we’ll do so with drums, tambourines, &lt;i&gt;pleneras&lt;/i&gt;, cowbells, and so on and so on, &lt;i&gt;parranda&lt;/i&gt; style. Think Christmas caroling but fun and ten times louder. You might even find yourself swinging your hips while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ll also bring trucks with full sound systems &amp;#8212; we’re talking massive speakers and subwoofers blasting music together &amp;#8212; that’ll somehow make their way through a sea of protesters and park right in front of Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, and the hottest Russian club in D.C. These will be used for &lt;i&gt;perreo combativo&lt;/i&gt;, aka reggaeton protest parties. Warm-up squats are recommended. Hairdos requiring way too much hair spray are not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And you’ll look forward to the nightly &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1153820960039948290?s=20"&gt;cacerolazo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a half-hour session of lots of people banging pots and pans on balconies or outside their homes. It’ll be your chance to hit something hollow and loud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Permits? What permits?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is, after all, a peaceful revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;We’re all over the United States, so this will also go national&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;We know, we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe you thought we were Mexican because we were speaking Spanish. But seriously, you can find us in Florida, New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Hawaii, Alaska (maybe), and so on. And if you want Puerto Ricans from the island’s front lines, we can make that happen, too. After all, we can clarify over and over that we’re U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Expect to see lots of awesome celebrities&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our roster includes many global celebrities like Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny, Residente, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Benicio del Toro. They will either join or convene a rally that most people living on this planet will want to attend. Or at least watch. They’ll even release a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSh7HIH2pvg"&gt;protest song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;We deliver results fairly quickly&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;After roughly two weeks of non-partisan demonstrations with &lt;a href="https://www.elnuevodia.com/english/english/nota/hundredsofthousandsrallyagainstpuertoricogovernor-2507328/"&gt;hundreds of thousands of people&lt;/a&gt;, trending hashtags like #RickyRenuncia, and &lt;a href="https://www.primerahora.com/fotogalerias/noticias/puerto-rico/paqueteriasmiralosmejoresmemesdelasemana-1353621/foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-undefined//foto-9/"&gt;countless memes&lt;/a&gt;, like “Don’t get mad, Ricky; we all quit our first job,” we forced Rosselló to announce his resignation on Facebook and then confirm it in writing to stop impeachment proceedings. Of course, we realize that Trump is different and that impeachment and non-partisan protests are out of the question, partly because he’s backed by a party who forgot about the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, don’t worry: we know that if there’s one thing that Trump is afraid of, it’s a large group of Hispanics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Apply For an Academic Job and Also Summon the Ancient Mesopotamian Demon Pazuzu</title>
      <dc:creator>Ross Bullen</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;h4&gt;Step One: The Job Search&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for job postings in the usual places: the &lt;i&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/i&gt;, faculty listservs, and esoteric manuscripts hidden in the Vatican library. Pay particular attention to jobs located near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the Fertile Crescent region. Job ads written in Sumerian cuneiform should go in the “definitely apply” pile. Same goes for any job that offers to pay you in livestock, grain, or small golden trinkets. If you’re not sure if a job is right for you, try staring into a broken mirror and saying the name of the school 666 times. If the mirror starts to bleed, you’re definitely on the right track.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Step Two: Formatting Your C.V.&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some basics:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;8.5”x11” paper&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1” margins&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;single-spaced&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;12-point font (ideally Sumerian cuneiform)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;outline major scholastic achievements, in reverse chronological order, recorded in the blood of a newly-slaughtered ram&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;place the finished document in an envelope, and then place the envelope in a 3,000-year-old Babylonian urn, which you should bury under the search committee chair’s office&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;be sure to include graduate transcripts, an academic writing sample, and a mummified goat fetus to make your application really stand out&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Step Three: The Cover Letter&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;List all of the worldly goods (grain reserves, coin hoards, first-born children) you would be willing to sacrifice in order to get this job. Two pages, single-spaced, maximum. Address the letter “To whom it may concern,” throw it into the Dead Sea, and get ready to play the waiting game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Step Four: The Waiting Game&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wake up every morning and check the Academic Jobs Wiki. Then check to see if your bathtub is filled with blood. If it is, congratulations! This means the Mesopotamian demon Pazuzu has accepted your offer. Using the Babylonian urn you buried under the chair’s office as a portal from the netherworld to this plane of existence, he has infiltrated the campus, and possessed the search committee chair. Later that day, you will watch seven crows fall from the sky and land in a perfect circle, which is a sign that you have been offered a job interview (you will also receive an email about this). Okay, it’s time to get excited! Pack your bags! (With a large crucifix and several copper daggers!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Step Five: The Interview&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sit down with the search committee. Remember: they’re nervous too. The search chair seems especially distressed &amp;#8212; head rotating 360, vomiting bile, cursing in an unknown dialect. This could be the result of either demonic possession or a rejected sabbatical application. You need to be sure. Show the chair the large crucifix and copper daggers you brought with you. If he takes one of the daggers and carves the words “Publish Or Perish” into his torso, you’ll know that Pazuzu is going to force the rest of the committee to hire you. If he tries to stab you with the dagger, he may need more persuading. Try brandishing the crucifix and yelling, “The power of Christ compels you!” (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: if it’s a secular school try yelling something about the power of innovation instead). At this point, Pazuzu will either help you get the job or disappear forever in a cloud of sulfurous black smoke. Regardless, you should thank the committee for their time, go home, and wait for the job offer/writ of excommunication to arrive in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Step Six: Getting Tenure&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’ll have five years to publish a book, a dozen journal articles, teach four classes per semester, and sit on an endless procession of committees, all while trying to pay off your student loans and maintain the illusion of a personal life. Sorry, but even an ancient demon like Pazuzu has limits to his powers. We suggest seeking out a truly malevolent source of evil instead, like Baphomet, Beelzebub, or &amp;#8212; if things get really desperate &amp;#8212; the university president’s office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I Am Marrying My Opinion That Donald Trump Is Not a Racist</title>
      <dc:creator>Devorah Blachor</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MINISTER&lt;/span&gt;: Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man, Ed, and this opinion, that Donald Trump is not a racist, together in holy matrimony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This blessed union of marriage is not one to be entered lightly, but reverently, passionately and blindly, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/trump-racism-comments/588067/"&gt;despite all the evidence over many years that Donald Trump is, in fact, a racist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the years they have been together, Ed and his opinion that Donald Trump is not a racist have only grown closer together, with renewed commitment each time Donald Trump calls an African country a &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-wants-less-shthole-immigrants-more-norwegians"&gt;shithole&lt;/a&gt;, or attacks &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/why-trump-targeted-colin-kaepernick/579628/"&gt;Colin Kaepernick&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0728-trump-baltimore-20190727-k6ac4yvnpvcczlaexdfglifada-story.html"&gt;degrades a predominantly black community&lt;/a&gt;, or tells a brown person to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/15/741827580/go-back-where-you-came-from-the-long-rhetorical-roots-of-trump-s-racist-tweets"&gt;go back to where they came from&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We celebrate the wondrous love that exists today between Ed and his opinion that Donald Trump is not a racist. Love is joyous. Love is mysterious. Love is Ed explaining why Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2019/07/15/trump-racist-tweets-twitter/"&gt;support of birtherism&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t problematic, but just something people do in their spare time that is totally normal and not racist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ed and your opinion that Donald Trump is not a racist: Today, you are surrounded by your friends and family, all of whom have listened to your endless justifications of why &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/nyregion/central-park-five-trump.html"&gt;Donald Trump’s obsession with executing five innocent black teenagers&lt;/a&gt; does not indicate any deficiency of character or racial bias. The possibilities of your life together are endless, and now falls upon you the task of choosing your values, such as getting outraged over people who believe that Donald Trump is a racist instead of considering, even for a moment, that they might be on to something. Clinging to these values for dear life will sustain you through times of trial and darkness, like when &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-believers-crushed-after-mueller-report-fails-to-lead-to-hillary-clintons-arrest"&gt;the Mueller Report did not result in the arrests of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Eric Holder, and Loretta Lynch&lt;/a&gt; as Qanon promised it would.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there is any person present who has reason to believe that Ed and his opinion that Donald Trump is not a racist should not be joined together in holy matrimony, let them speak now and be lectured for an hour by Ed about how the Democrats are the real racists, or forever hold their peace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who gives this opinion that Donald Trump is not a racist to be married to this man?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEAN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HANNITY&lt;/span&gt;: I do&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ED: I take you, my opinion that Donald Trump is not a racist, to be my lawfully wedded belief, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, honor, and cherish, ’til death do us part, no matter what Donald Trump says or does or even if they do release &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-n-word-apprentice-1445854"&gt;that tape of Donald Trump saying the n-word&lt;/a&gt;, which wouldn’t prove anything anyway, because no one knows what’s really in Donald Trump’s heart. Except for me. I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KNOW&lt;/span&gt; he’s not a racist and I know it so hard that I’m marrying it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ED&amp;#8217;S &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPINION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DONALD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRUMP&lt;/span&gt; IS &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RACIST&lt;/span&gt;: Same!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MINISTER&lt;/span&gt;: By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you man and belief! What denial has joined together, let no man put asunder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>List: Clever Ways to Tell Your Therapist to Go to Hell Because Your Time Machine Works!</title>
      <dc:creator>Ryan Ciecwisz and Ian Goldstein</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Stuff it, Marcia! The only negative feedback loops I’ll be experiencing now are of the quantum mechanical kind.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Get lost, Marcia! Because even though you told me I’m good enough, the cash I’m gonna make from investing in 1997 Enron will make me good n’ stuffed (fiscally and nutritionally).&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Sod off, Marcia! Because you reminded me I can’t control what my family says about my poor career choices and passion for reviving Enron, but now I can manipulate general relativity, which will help me manipulate my relatives, generally!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If I may invoke Shakespeare: &amp;#8216;I do desire we may be better strangers, Marcia!&amp;#8217; You said there were no shortcuts to success, but guess what, how does using a wormhole that cuts through space-time to provide a financial safe haven for my mentors at Enron sound?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Kick rocks, Marcia! You said I couldn’t prevent my parents&amp;#8217; divorce, but I’m going to make sure they never met by murdering my grandfather.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Leave, Marcia! You don&amp;#8217;t want me to travel back to the exact moment my wife told me she didn&amp;#8217;t find me attractive anymore (after my crossbow/hang gliding accident) so I can re-experience the suffering and derive masochistic pleasure from it. And it&amp;#8217;s very petty of you, to be honest.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hit the road, Marcia! You told me I shouldn’t judge my current self based on how my younger self behaved, but I’m going to confront my past self and heavily judge him (fiscally and nutritionally).&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hit the bricks, Marcia! No matter what you say to me, I&amp;#8217;m going back to the day of the crossbow/hang gliding accident so I can change one variable that I think will alter the incident for the better: more pre-gaming so I didn&amp;#8217;t spend as much money at the bar.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Scram, Marcia! The only tears I’ll be crying from now on are the ones formed from my natural bodily reaction when traveling faster than the speed of light.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Smell ya later, Marcia! You like to talk about cognitive distortions. Well, the only distortion I’m seeing now is how fat my wallet is stretched with all the money I’m saving not going to therapy. Money that I can use for general maintenance/repairs to my time machine.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Get out, Marcia! Because that one memory I have of falling off the chair at my bar mitzvah party being the root of my many anxieties, you know the one that you told me I can’t remove? Well, guess what? I’m going back and removing all chairs from the event. Then I’ll be murdering my grandpa.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Bug out, Marcia! I won’t be paying your reasonably priced bills anymore. The only debts I’ll owe are to society for not seeing &lt;i&gt;Men In Black&lt;/i&gt; more times.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Beat it, Marcia! You&amp;#8217;re so mad because I&amp;#8217;ll be too busy to pay you for sessions while I&amp;#8217;m traveling back to July 2nd, 1997 to re-experience opening night of &lt;i&gt;Men In Black&lt;/i&gt;, July 3rd, 2002 for &lt;i&gt;Men In Black 2&lt;/i&gt;, May 25th, 2012 for &lt;i&gt;Men In Black &lt;/i&gt;, and, yup, you guessed it, June 14th, 2019 for &lt;i&gt;Men in Black: International&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Toodle-oo, Marcia! I can&amp;#8217;t believe I wasted all these years on therapy with you when I could have saved us both time by traveling back to my middle school self and introducing him to Juul technology so I&amp;#8217;d be popular and never have any self-esteem issues when I got older.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So&amp;#8230; how much time do we have left?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I’m Inoculating My Kids Against the Dangers of Scientific Evidence</title>
      <dc:creator>Hannah Kane</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Nancy, mother of five beautiful children, none of whom have stepped foot in a science classroom or seen a Bunsen burner in three years. I work every day to protect them from the harmful consequences of knowing too much about the way things actually work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people downplay the risks of scientific knowledge, arguing that the benefits outweigh the costs. They make this claim based solely on the fact that science has led to important life-saving medical advances, revealed many wonders of the universe, and opened up vast new frontiers of human potential. But they are not considering the unintended negative side effects such as the possibility of learning something scary or feeling extremely overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used to be pro-science myself. I only became an anti-science activist after I realized how much of my dream-interpretation-based worldview was incompatible with what I was reading in scientific journals. Since then, I have become a fierce activist. I make passionate arguments against the so-called “scientific method” (it’s just making guesses) and the value of peer-reviewed studies (excuse me for wanting to think for myself!). When my children ask me why the sky is blue, I tell them the truth. That there’s no way to find out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am only advocating that people do what’s right for them, and I’m doing that the best way I know how &amp;#8212; by focusing on the examples that support my point of view and sharing them on Facebook. My work also includes an intense regimen of exposing fake research. I have become very adept at spotting fake research &amp;#8212; the trick is to look for evidence that counters my argument in any way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people don’t know that there have been many instances of scientific information that turned out to be wrong. The way I see it, every time someone posits a new scientific theory, it either is or isn’t true. 50/50 chance, right? Do you really want to risk your child’s well-being on a 50/50 chance? My rule is to be very suspicious of anyone who claims they know something for sure, except for Oprah. In this era of Photoshop and deep fakes, you really can’t believe anything anymore, believe me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have told me that by preventing my children from learning about science, I am putting others at risk. But it’s not like me spreading alternate information about climate change, stem-cell research, or vaccines is harming anyone. Information doesn’t kill people; the trace amounts of formaldehyde in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMR&lt;/span&gt; vaccine does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like a pariah just because I launched a campaign to de-fund the science programs at my children’s schools. But it really bothers me when the government interferes in our ability to choose whether science is right for us by mandating a science curriculum in schools. Science is a personal thing, best left to the individual. Besides, did my children’s science teachers get a degree in my kids? I don’t think so. I should be able to decide whether science applies to my family or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people say my way of looking at things is scary. But do you know what’s really scary? Living in a world where the tyrannical scientific consensus outweighs the unsupported opinions of the few. Ask yourself &amp;#8212; is manned spaceflight really worth the price of your liberty? It’s going to be pretty hard to enjoy your solar power and cancer cures while you’re wrapped up in the chains of mental bondage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s what this is all about. Freedom. The freedom to choose my own reality and live there, unburdened by intellectual discovery. The freedom to think critically about the value of critical thinking, which is no value at all. The freedom to protect my kids in the most responsible way I can: by using internet-based decision-making and a mother’s intuition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Updated Government Seals</title>
      <dc:creator>Ali Solomon</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;The presidential seal was not, in fact, the presidential seal at all, as the Washington Post reported. Instead of the customary bald eagle, the altered image showed a double-headed eagle, similar to that featured in Russia’s national emblem. Instead of arrows, the eagle clutched a set of golf clubs in a talon. It appeared as the president emerged onstage.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/presidential-seal-trump.html"&gt;New York Times, 7/25/19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d3thpuk46eyjbu.cloudfront.net/uploads/production/4002/1564147428/original/seal-Supreme_Court.jpg?1564147428" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d3thpuk46eyjbu.cloudfront.net/uploads/production/4003/1564147475/original/seal-house.jpg?1564147475" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d3thpuk46eyjbu.cloudfront.net/uploads/production/4004/1564147510/original/seal-Senate.jpg?1564147510" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d3thpuk46eyjbu.cloudfront.net/uploads/production/4005/1564147544/original/seal-FBI.jpg?1564147544" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d3thpuk46eyjbu.cloudfront.net/uploads/production/4006/1564147578/original/Seal-Dept_of_Education.jpg?1564147578" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='break'&gt;- - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d3thpuk46eyjbu.cloudfront.net/uploads/production/4007/1564147626/original/seal-president.jpg?1564147626" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enjoy Your Family Summer Vacation At the Beach House Your Father-In-Law Rented For 18 People</title>
      <dc:creator>Jessica Delfino</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Cooper Real Estate! We hope you enjoy your week at the beach house that your Buddhist doctor Father-In-Law paid for. He barely says two words to anyone for years at a time, then he randomly goes and does cool things like this. That’s just who he is! Anyway, welcome to one of your rare in-law vacations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every third Wednesday of the month there is karaoke at the bar a block away, every first Monday there are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOGO&lt;/span&gt; tacos and bottomless margaritas at Taco Jim’s, and once a month there’s a huge beach bonfire party. Bummer though, none of these events fall on the week you are here. However, here are some other highlights:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Monday, July 29&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When you arrive, you may be inclined to walk throughout the house to size up all the rooms. Though you’re not contributing financially to the cost, feel free to get irrationally miffed that your lesbian step-aunts got a bigger room than you did. At least you don’t have to sleep in the bunk beds or share a room with your moody teenage cousin by marriage. Note: she isn’t moody, she just hates you. But don’t take it too personally. She hates pretty much everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tuesday, July 30&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pool Party! There’s a sweet heated pool and hot tub in the back yard. Unfortunately, the water heater is broken and it’s going to be chilly all week, so looks like you’ll be shit out of luck, bud. But check it out — the shower gets pretty hot if you can sneak in there as there will be a lot of competing bodies. Pro tip: Wear flip-flops. Plus, you can still swim in the pool if you like, but you’ll just be cold and alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wednesday, July 31&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Beach day! The beach is only seven short blocks from your house, which is pretty close compared to how far away the beach is from the actual place you call home. Despite that, when you’re carrying four chairs, a beach umbrella, a bucket of sand toys, and a bag of towels, waters, snacks, and sunscreen in the blazing sun, it feels a lot farther. Just call it cardio and remember: it’s practically a free vacation!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, you should get to the beach soon &amp;#8212; a storm will hit on Tuesday night, overloading the drains, which will then dump into the ocean. It’s not raw sewage, just rainwater, but we totally get it if you don’t want to swim in it. It’s still probably cleaner than the water you drink wherever you came from. Still wouldn’t recommend it, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thursday, August 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Movie night! There are TVs in every room, and while most of them are broken or props, the one in the living room works. However, we strongly recommend that you don’t watch the demented sex-video game episode of &lt;i&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/i&gt;, because your aunt-in-law, cousin, brother-in-law, and his wife will wander in during the racy scenes and it will be extremely awkward for all involved. Netflix and chill isn’t a family affair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weekend &amp;#8211; Friday, August 2 through Sunday, August 4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wild Card! Try one or more of the following activities:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Order seafood anytime your father-in-law does and he will pick up the bill&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Disappear when it’s dish-washing time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Though you’re knocking on 40’s door, dress and act 22&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Drink copious amounts of the infused-seltzer low-calorie booze Aunt Tani buys daily, along with your cousin by marriage who is not of legal drinking age (the moody one who hates you)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Definitely try some sublingual tincture that your stoner aunt by marriage (Aunt Jen) brought from the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBD&lt;/span&gt; business she started&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do a few minutes of yoga on the beach with Aunt Livia, and then bail&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Shower whenever you go near any body of water or get bored&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There’s a football somewhere, also an ancient puzzle&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gossip with the younger generation about the older generation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Steal away with your husband to the five-and-dime store and buy a bumper sticker or a plastic sun hat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read a dog-eared copy of &lt;i&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/i&gt; on the patio between rain squalls&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find unexpected solace in your tiny seashell-themed room&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Try to think up creative ways to escape a clunky and odd conversation with an aunt by marriage’s boyfriend&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is so much to do!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few more notes on the house: the Wi-Fi password won’t work, cousin Ella will always sit in the most comfortable chair thus rendering it useless to anyone else, and your new Aunt Dee will wear sexy lingerie to dinner. Don’t mind her, she does things like that. (She’s a free spirit!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, you may act like it’s hard to go on vacation with the in-laws, but we know you’re secretly thrilled to be here, so don’t forget to send thank you notes if you want to be invited back again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, and if anything goes wrong, feel free to email us, but we will be on our own vacation this week, so we won’t respond to emails until after you’ve packed up and left. Happy summer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In Order to Become More Competitive In Our Sector We’ve Decided to Make a Series of Terrible Decisions That Will Make Your Job Way Worse</title>
      <dc:creator>Chas Gillespie</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to this all-hands meeting, which I invited you to via a series of coy emails with subjects like “It’s Big Ideas Time” in an attempt to get you to buy-in to a series of decisions before you hear them, because I feared and still fear the possibility that you will rebel from a top-down management style that I try to play off as democratic. Robin, the lights?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As any Buddhist will tell you, the only thing we are sure of in life is change, and that the best way to start a speech is with a bit of wisdom that, while true, becomes diminished and actually kind of offensive in a managerial context. I also have some John Wooden quotes I could relay to you, but you’re probably already familiar with them due to my email signature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is our situation: things here are going well, really well actually, but not as well as an imaginary benchmark that people who don’t work here have created. People, generally speaking, some group of people, somewhere far away, don’t have confidence in us. Investors are wary, some of them. The public, well, only about 80% of the public is on our side. And when people’s confidence in us is only medium-to-medium-high, this creates all sorts of issues for us, none of which actually matter, but some of which matter to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I brought in some people. Call them consultants, call them decision-makers, call them experts fluent in the type of business-speak that you find in the section of the bookstore where Trump’s books are, the point is, they are very good at making you think they know what they’re talking about, even when their skill set mainly involves making wealth inequality much worse, alienating workers from each other and from the results of their work, and using &amp;#8220;data&amp;#8221; as a generic catchall answer to the question, &amp;#8220;Why, dear God why, are you doing all this?&amp;#8221; I trust them because they cost money. They cost money because people trust them. Everybody trusts them. They cost a lot of money. And I don’t want to admit that I misspent funds, so I feel obliged to pay attention to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What they told me is, we need to adapt to a changing ecosystem. Metaphorically speaking, we need to grow a new skin or some kind of third stomach, suitable for the new sorts of metaphor plants that are now growing in our competitive forest. Our sector isn’t the same as it was ten years ago. And so we can do the same things we’ve always done, or we can stand on two legs for the first time, put on some Jordans, and jump for fruit that we used to collect by looking for undigested scraps in large mammals’ droppings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you? It’s actually quite straightforward: we are going to immediately and irrevocably change your responsibilities, alter your workflow, needlessly complicate our management structure, and dramatically transform how you relate to external and internal stakeholders. Each of these changes has been painstakingly considered by people who don’t work here, or by people who do work here but are isolated from the results of their decisions by a series of structures which ensure that they basically don’t understand what goes on here on a day-to-day basis. The nature of my knowledge is piecemeal, incomplete, and incoherent, and that’s why it’s so valuable: because it’s mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll be a little more detailed: whereas before you had projects that made you think, “This is difficult, but I can get it done,” now you’ll have projects that will make you think, “I don’t know what this is, I don’t know who to ask what this is, and nobody in my vicinity has any clue what’s happening.” Whereas before you had a team and a supervisor, now you’ll have a “network of colleagues,” the exact nature of which is deeply mysterious, and who you can’t count on for much of anything because it’s unclear who has what responsibility. Whereas before you had a small group of people who you mentored, now you won’t be mentoring anybody with consistency, and thus the part of your job that made you think, “You know what, I matter,” has now disappeared. Whereas before you received twenty-five emails per day, now you will receive ninety-five emails per day because you will be part of several new “horizontal groups” that have strange acronyms and you don’t know why they exist. Whereas before, when you received an email, you would think to yourself, “I understand the words that are inside this email,” now when you receive an email, you will think, “Was this sent to me by mistake? What even is this?” Whereas before it was clear what your relationship with external stakeholders was, now, in the guise of being more “transparent,” you will receive endless questions you don’t know the answers to, from people you don’t know, and when you tell them you’ll go looking for an answer, they get upset because their answer doesn’t come in a timely fashion. Whereas before there was a clear career path along which you could advance, now it’s every person for themselves in a sort of schmoozefest-to-the-top that is quite frankly sickening. Whereas before we had bring-your-dog-to-work day, now you will have bring-your-work-home day, which is every day. Whereas before you more-or-less trusted upper-level management, now you will not trust us at all, and you will mine our various communications for further signs of deterioration, the result of which will be a near total loss of faith in our ability to shepherd this organization, the further result of which will be a loss of motivation to do your job well, because if management is screwing up so badly, what’s the point of anything?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that your best friend at this job will quit in three weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that my decisions arose from a place of rationality and careful consideration, and were not the result of intense, all-consuming pressure placed on me by our casino capitalist political economy that values change for its own sake, fetishizes “leadership”—by which I mean reckless self-aggrandizement instead of prudence and consensus-building — makes you think other people are out to destroy or replace you, provides cover for the lie that CEOs deserve to make three hundred times what their employees make, encourages the proud annihilation of the natural world, has totally warped and degraded the incentives of elected officials, encourages staff to be overworked and underpaid in order to serve the interests of people who have no interest in serving others, and is the reason my mental health has deteriorated while I’ve had this job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will not be receiving a raise. But I plan to use my large salary to donate to several charities the minimum amount of money that makes me think I am a good person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one month’s time, expect to receive a questionnaire about how things are going, and expect an organization-wide reply three weeks later in which I spin the disastrous feedback into near-universal praise with such saccharine ferocity that you will think I have lost touch with reality as we commonly understand it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any questions can be directed to your immediate supervisor, who won’t know the answers because they had no say in my decisions, and to reiterate, they aren’t your supervisor anymore, except they sort of are still? Thank you and, to paraphrase the great Buddha Shakyamuni, we should not live in the past but rather dwell fully in the very strange new present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>List: Things You’ll Never Hear a Three-Year-Old Say</title>
      <dc:creator>Olivia Appleby</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t really look like a dragon, but never mind, I’ll eat it anyway – food is food!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yep, that’s exactly how I wanted it done. You’ve nailed it. Again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter how we did this yesterday. Things change!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For God’s sake, it’s 3:30 in the morning. Please, go back to bed &amp;#8212; you’re starting a new job and this is the one night you really need a decent sleep. You’re over this shit, and frankly, so am I.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t need it. Already have three. Let’s just stick to our shopping list.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here’s the remote back &amp;#8212; I don’t really know how to use it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I bet I can get in my car seat before you can say the words, ‘my back. I can’t… straighten&amp;#8230; up…’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t hide that square millimeter of zucchini. More! More green! I’m into micro sprouts at the moment, too.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m off to the toilet, simply because I need to go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here’s your phone back.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My New Meditation App Makes Me Feel SO Much Better Than You</title>
      <dc:creator>Chase McNeill</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good morning! I cannot even describe to you how much meditation has changed my life, but obviously, I will. My mind used to be so trapped in reactionary cycles, and now I’m gaining clarity on the sources of my pain. The secret is I don’t meditate like just anybody. I’m using my smartphone as a tool for self-awareness and inner peace. My meditation app makes me feel SO much better than you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as I downloaded Wakeful and listened to the guided meditations, I started seeing the world differently. I’ve finally opened my eyes to the universal light and our chance encounters with the divine. Don’t you think so? Like, for example, how do you think the universe conspired to bring us together right now? Of course, I desperately needed therapy and I’m paying you $130 an hour, but I mean, other than that. It’s so serendipitous that we’re present in this place, and it is truly amazing that I’m even bothering to talk to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wakeful opened my eyes. Stumbling through life asleep and unaware made it impossible to reflect on my reactive patterns; sort of in the same way you’re blinded to how unbecoming that top looks on you. It’s a fantastic metaphor for our limited experience. I’m sure that there’s no way you can see, I mean, truly see how much that top makes your shoulders look rounded and bulbous. But meditation frees us all to witness our truest selves, and that vision breaks us free from our fears. Left unattended, that fear controls us. Like if I were you, I would be absolutely mortified, I mean &amp;#8212; would not be caught dead &amp;#8212; in that sweater.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the app changed the relationship I have with my iPhone X. After examining my deepest intentions, I decided to upgrade. I also got absolutely trashed at my cousin’s wedding and dropped my second iPhone 8 in the margarita fountain, but I’m not the yogi who claims to have all the answers. I prefer to think of myself as a leaning Buddha, and on that particular night, I was leaning directly into the kitchen sink of a $400 per-night Airbnb. I assume Wakeful works on Android, which tracks with your whole “let-me-write-that-down” vibe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I never anticipated the effects Wakeful would have on my body. I used to constantly compare myself to others, trapped in cycles of jealousy and self-judgment, but now I finally see that I have absolutely nothing to be jealous of. I don’t mean jealous of you, of course. Who would be? You smell like an old book took a shit on a pile of Goodwill cardigans. Anyway, I know I’m already Instagram hot, but I had no idea how much better my body would feel than yours. Your aura seems toxic and off-balance, especially since we deepened our third-eye connection today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned to be self-compassionate, not to mention self-congratulatory. I admit freely that I love myself! I even love you, despite how much you’ve frowned and coughed since we started. I highly recommend Wakeful’s free introductory lessons. If you can find time to scroll through random Facebook posts and gab with all these losers, you can improve the hollow specter of what you call “your life” with meditation. Of course, Wakeful isn’t for everyone. Each light-being follows their own journey, but we can obviously see how that’s worked out for you. You listen to sad people for money. So.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about the word &lt;i&gt;attention&lt;/i&gt;? Of course you haven’t, but you know what I mean. Attention comes from the root “attend,” which in Middle English means “to apply one’s mind or energies to.” You aren’t even paying attention to me right now. I’m right here, silly! Naturally, your inattention will affect my Yelp review, which, since I’m attending to my truths, will be scathing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, since you’re just sobbing and sobbing and I’m basically enlightened, let&amp;#8217;s cut our last session a little short. As a higher being, I’m glad you got to see just a glimpse of what’s waiting for you on the other side of Wakeful. In lieu of payment, I have a promo code for one month off the introductory course. Seriously, take it. And you know what? Take this gum, too. I honestly think you have gingivitis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, the promo code! I almost forgot. It’s &amp;#8220;wakeup&amp;#8221; underscore &amp;#8220;dumbfuck.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Please Consider My Application to Give You Labor So I Can Stay Alive</title>
      <dc:creator>Chandler Dean</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To Whom It May Concern, or To Whom It May Not Concern Whatsoever,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for considering my application to show up in a building for 40 hours a week doing whatever tasks you want me to do. I am excited for the opportunity to dedicate my most productive hours, days, weeks, months, and potentially years of my life to your enterprise, in exchange for your giving me paper that allows me to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am reaching out because I think that my skills match your needs as a company. I have a body and brain that can be transported wherever I am told to go; you, meanwhile, have a repository of funds &amp;#8212; a small percentage of which could be used to secure my labor for as long as you care to keep me around. (And by around, I mean here on this Earth.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I must say, I think I would be an excellent fit for your company culture. Upon some cursory research, I learned that your employees share a common purpose: showing up to the office every day and following instructions so that they can eat, have a place to sleep, and (maybe) get access to healthcare. I am confident that as a member of your corporate team, I would immediately demonstrate those qualities too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am also impressed by your benefits package. Not only do your employees receive money that allows them to purchase basic necessities &amp;#8212; you also provide them with other money that can be used for luxury goods, like clothes, air conditioning units, and plane tickets home to visit their grandmothers in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further, I was encouraged to see that dedicated workers who receive conditional promotions over the course of a few decades or so are sometimes rewarded with additional money, in the height of largesse: this results in occasional day trips to the beach, the chance to own the dwelling they reside in, and even the right to stop performing labor in the last few years before their death (assuming natural causes).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you look at my résumé, I think you’ll find that I have extensive relevant experience that I could bring to the table after onboarding. In the formative years of my life, I attended primary school in exchange for not being detained per truancy laws in my home state; I then matriculated to college, where I cut my teeth going to classes in exchange for a framed sheet of cardstock that was a prerequisite for submitting this application. (I also literally cut my teeth but couldn’t do anything about it because my parents don’t have dental insurance.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During that time, I also took on several unpaid internships in exchange for the increased probability of securing other unpaid internships. So, all of this is to say: I know what it takes to voluntarily surrender my autonomy to an organization in an effort to continue existing. In other words, I am all about that hustle!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I understand that this is a competitive position, and you’ll be receiving hundreds of similar applications from other qualified individuals. And it would be ethically unjustifiable for me to argue that my humanity is somehow superior to that of the other applicants, and that you should select me, leaving the others to find some other means of making a living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet, at the same time: I am arguing that my humanity is somehow superior to that of the other applicants. You should select me. Leave the others to find some other means of making a living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am fully aware of the prestige associated with this company and the role I would be taking on. That’s why I can pledge right now that if I am given an offer, I will happily field LinkedIn messages from future prospective employees and give them advice about how they too can improve their chances of serving your company’s interests. That advice will include, and be limited to, “just keep putting apps out there,” “be yourself in the interview,” and “you can mention my name but it probably won’t make a difference.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for your consideration. I can’t wait to hear back from you. Really, I genuinely can’t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
