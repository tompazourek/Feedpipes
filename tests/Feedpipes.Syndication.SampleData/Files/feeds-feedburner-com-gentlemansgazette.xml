								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually, when we think of someone&rsquo;s style, we envision the entire person, and their &ldquo;outfit&rdquo; as a whole. Their style is made up of what they wear from head to toe; it&rsquo;s a total look or impression. However, it can be useful to consider how we dress from a new angle: we can divide an outfit into sections and use this as a principle of style. Read on for our tips on how to &ldquo;divide and conquer.&rdquo; </p>



<span id="more-110832"></span>



<h2>Beginners: Focus Attention on Part of Your Outfit</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gun-Club-Ring-Jacket-from-the-Armoury.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gun-Club-Ring-Jacket-from-the-Armoury.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-111046" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gun-Club-Ring-Jacket-from-the-Armoury.jpg 564w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gun-Club-Ring-Jacket-from-the-Armoury-301x450.jpg 301w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gun-Club-Ring-Jacket-from-the-Armoury-471x705.jpg 471w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px"></a><figcaption>The part of a tailored outfit typically focused on in social media photos, also known as the &ldquo;V-Zone&rdquo; </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The simplest way to apply the principle of dividing in men&rsquo;s style is by breaking down your outfit into key areas where you can concentrate your attention. With <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tailoring (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suit-alterations-what-a-tailor-can-do/" target="_blank">tailoring</a>, the main area of focus on your entire outfit is always the triangle formed above the buttoning point of your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="suit jacket (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-anatomy-suit-jacket/" target="_blank">suit jacket</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="sport coat (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-sport-coat-8-secrets/" target="_blank">sport coat</a>. This includes your tie, visible shirt, and any <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="waistcoat (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/vest-waistcoat-guide/" target="_blank">waistcoat</a> or vest you are wearing. It&rsquo;s not coincidental that there are so many headless selfies on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/best-mens-style-blogs-instagram-youtube-tumblr/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> with closeups concentrating on this triangle. Sometimes the area is referred to as the &ldquo;V-Zone,&rdquo; especially in China, Japan and Korea. This makes sense because the lapels of your jacket form an obvious &ldquo;V,&rdquo; but be careful using the term in America as it is also used to refer to a male erogenous zone in magazines like <em>Cosmopolitan.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fort-Belvedere-Paisley-Real-Ancient-Madder-tie-burguny-wool-challis-pocket-square-with-yellow-polka-dots-.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fort-Belvedere-Paisley-Real-Ancient-Madder-tie-burguny-wool-challis-pocket-square-with-yellow-polka-dots--900x601.jpg" alt="Fort Belvedere Paisley Real Ancient Madder tie &amp; burgundy wool challis pocket square with yellow polka dots" class="wp-image-21818" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fort-Belvedere-Paisley-Real-Ancient-Madder-tie-burguny-wool-challis-pocket-square-with-yellow-polka-dots--900x601.jpg 900w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fort-Belvedere-Paisley-Real-Ancient-Madder-tie-burguny-wool-challis-pocket-square-with-yellow-polka-dots--450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fort-Belvedere-Paisley-Real-Ancient-Madder-tie-burguny-wool-challis-pocket-square-with-yellow-polka-dots--705x470.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Fort-Belvedere-Paisley-Real-Ancient-Madder-tie-burguny-wool-challis-pocket-square-with-yellow-polka-dots-.jpg 1499w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></a><figcaption>Fort Belvedere <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Paisley Real Ancient Madder tie (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/madder-silk-tie-paisley-blue-red-handmade-fort-belvedere" target="_blank">Paisley Real Ancient Madder tie</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/pocket-square-wool-challis-burgundy-yellow-polka-dots-fort-belvedere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="burgundy wool challis pocket square with yellow polka dots (opens in a new tab)">burgundy wool challis pocket square with yellow polka dots</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A lot of your style impact is packed into this inverted triangle, mainly because it exists so near your face, at others&rsquo; eye level. This means that if you&rsquo;re new to dressing well in the classic style, you can direct your efforts here first. The true center of interest here will be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="your tie (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/essential-ties-every-man-should-invest-in/" target="_blank">your tie</a>, so choose one that lends visual appeal. You can go with the usual printed silk business tie, but to stand out in a way that remains professional, select something unique like a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/ties-3-fold/silk-ties/real-ancient-madder-silk-ties" target="_blank">real ancient madder</a> print with its powdery hand feel, or a textured solid <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/ties-3-fold/silk-ties/grenadine-silk-ties" target="_blank">grenadine</a>. Another important consideration when focusing on this part of your outfit is your tie width, which should be balanced with that of your jacket&rsquo;s lapels. A classic lapel width that never goes out of style is 3 to 3.5 inches (about 7.5 to 9 centimeters); your tie should be in the same range to create a pleasing visual balance in this central part of your outfit.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tie-width-should-match-lapel-width.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tie-width-should-match-lapel-width-900x674.jpg" alt="suits 2" class="wp-image-40787" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tie-width-should-match-lapel-width-900x674.jpg 900w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tie-width-should-match-lapel-width-450x337.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tie-width-should-match-lapel-width-1500x1124.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tie-width-should-match-lapel-width-705x528.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></a><figcaption>Improper (left) and proper (right) tie width to coordinate with lapels</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>You can also pay more attention to your shirts and choose something other than the usual plain white, perhaps <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="stripes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/stripes-menswear-different-types/" target="_blank">stripes</a>. Lastly, the <a aria-label="collar style (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shirt-collar-styles-a-complete-guide/" target="_blank">collar style</a> on your shirt is an often overlooked way to style the &ldquo;V-Zone.&rdquo; Instead of getting just anything, pay attention to the collars available, whether a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="button down (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/oxford-cloth-button-down-shirt-ocbd/" target="_blank">button down</a>, spread, point, round, or something else. You can simply choose a collar you like, or select something that counterbalances your face shape. If you have a wider face, get a collar with points that are closer together, and if your face is narrow, go with a spread collar.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Collar-Clip-outfit-with-madder-silk-and-boutonniere-lapel-flower.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Collar-Clip-outfit-with-madder-silk-and-boutonniere-lapel-flower-900x601.jpg" alt="Summer sport coat" class="wp-image-51833" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Collar-Clip-outfit-with-madder-silk-and-boutonniere-lapel-flower-900x601.jpg 900w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Collar-Clip-outfit-with-madder-silk-and-boutonniere-lapel-flower-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Collar-Clip-outfit-with-madder-silk-and-boutonniere-lapel-flower-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Collar-Clip-outfit-with-madder-silk-and-boutonniere-lapel-flower-1500x1001.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Collar-Clip-outfit-with-madder-silk-and-boutonniere-lapel-flower-705x471.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></a><figcaption>While the breast pocket lies outside of the true &ldquo;V-zone,&rdquo; a pocket square should still harmonize with it.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you wear a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/my-pocket-square-collection/" target="_blank">pocket square</a>, it technically lives outside the &ldquo;V-Zone,&rdquo; but it should be thought of an extension of it. This is especially true if your pocket square is made in the same material as your tie (silk and silk, for example) even if they should NEVER match one another exactly. By virtue of being close together and similar, they&rsquo;ll be connected visually. Therefore, it&rsquo;s important for the stylish man to think of both items as being part of the same area. Choose a pocket square that contains a bit of the same color present in your tie, or even your shirt. Alternatively, you could go with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="complementary color (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-use-the-color-wheel-to-assemble-superior-outfits/" target="_blank">complementary color</a> or pattern&ndash;say for example, a polka dot pocket square alongside a tie that has a <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/madder-silk-tie-handmade-green-blue-motif-fort-belvedere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="geometric pattern (opens in a new tab)">geometric pattern</a>. The same applies to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/boutonnieres" target="_blank">boutonniere</a>, which is actually placed on the &ldquo;V&rdquo; of your lapel. In the image above, Sven Raphael Schneider has chosen a pink flower to complement the purple of his necktie.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there aren&rsquo;t really that many other &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; in an outfit where style points are as highly concentrated. One other area is your feet, where having nicely polished, <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/anatomy-of-a-dress-shoe/">quality shoes</a> is important. It&rsquo;s not recommended that you call too much attention to this area, though. Personally, I avoid too much of a mirror shine or highly ornamented shoes, because it&rsquo;s preferable to direct people&rsquo;s attention to your face (via the &ldquo;V-Zone.&rdquo; However, when people don&rsquo;t make eye contact, they do tend to direct their gaze toward the ground, so the appearance of your shoes will still be important. Sophisticated <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/socks" target="_blank">socks</a> that aren&rsquo;t <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="overly flashy or super bright (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-you-wear-crazy-socks/" target="_blank">overly flashy or super bright</a> are another way to enhance this area of your look. If it fits your personality, you can also try some color in your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="shoelaces (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/shoelaces" target="_blank">shoelaces</a>. Keep in mind that for this particular region, less is more.</p>



<h2>Intermediate: Top and Bottom Halves</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Raphael-Navy-suit.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Raphael-Navy-suit-543x900.jpg" alt="Raphael Navy DB Suit Fort Belvedere Bow tie, pocket square and boutonniere" class="wp-image-56075" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Raphael-Navy-suit-543x900.jpg 543w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Raphael-Navy-suit-272x450.jpg 272w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Raphael-Navy-suit-768x1272.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Raphael-Navy-suit-906x1500.jpg 906w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Raphael-Navy-suit-426x705.jpg 426w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px"></a><figcaption>A suit is intended to present a sense of uniformity from top to bottom without division</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>1. Sport Coats vs. Suits</h3>



<p>When you&rsquo;re first learning about style, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="suits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-many-suits-does-a-man-need/" target="_blank">suits</a> are easier than sport-coat and non-matching <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="trouser (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/features-of-a-pair-of-pants/" target="_blank">trouser</a> combinations to coordinate, because you don&rsquo;t have to worry about matching the jacket with a different colored pair of pants. In fact, the purpose of the suit was originally to create a uniform look from top to bottom through the use of the exact same cloth, an aim that remains today. However, once you are adept at coordinating, you&rsquo;ll begin to savor the challenge of <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suit-jackets-sport-coats-and-blazers-whats-the-difference/">sport coat</a> and trouser pairings, as the division between top and bottom yields greater complexity and opportunities to be creative. For instance, with a single navy blue jacket you can pair light- or mid-gray pants, <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/brown-most-underrated-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="brown (opens in a new tab)">brown</a>, beige, rust, burgundy and more. Thus, graduating from suits to the sport coat game is a prime example of how dividing can give you a stylistic advantage.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers-648x1030.jpg" alt="James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, wearing a sports coat, odd trousers, and collared shirt." class="wp-image-103691" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers-648x1030.jpg 648w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers-283x450.jpg 283w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers-768x1222.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers-943x1500.jpg 943w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers-443x705.jpg 443w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dean-Sport-Coat-Trousers.jpg 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></a><figcaption><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="James Dean (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-style-james-dean/" target="_blank">James Dean</a> in &ldquo;Rebel Without a Cause,&rdquo; wearing a sports coat, odd trousers, and collared shirt.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>2. The Importance of the Waistline</h3>



<p>But, if we&rsquo;re talking &ldquo;division&rdquo; in the strict sense of the term, there&rsquo;s no more important line of separation than the one between your top and bottom halves: the waistline. Why is this line between your shirt or jacket and your pants so important? For one thing, the height of this line affects the sense of proportion created. A lot of this depends on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/low-mid-vs-high-rise/" target="_blank">rise</a> of your trousers. If your pants waist sits at your hips, your legs will seem shorter and your torso longer. On the other hand, if you wear pants with a high rise, your upper body will appear shorter and your legs longer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ethan-Wong-with-high-waisted-trousers.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ethan-Wong-with-high-waisted-trousers.jpg" alt="Ethan Wong wearing high-rise trousers" class="wp-image-102898" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ethan-Wong-with-high-waisted-trousers.jpg 683w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ethan-Wong-with-high-waisted-trousers-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ethan-Wong-with-high-waisted-trousers-470x705.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-suits-young-man-teen-ethan-wong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ethan Wong (opens in a new tab)">Ethan Wong</a> wearing high-rise trousers</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is a trick of the eye, an illusion&ndash;your body is unchanged&ndash;but that&rsquo;s the power of clothes: they disguise and enhance. It would seem that a mid-height rise on your trousers would be the most appropriate compromise (and it usually is), but if you have very long legs or a short torso, you will want to look for a pair of pants with a lower rise. Conversely, if your legs are short, get a higher rise. The waistline of your pants has a strong visual impact on how your bodily proportions are perceived.  <br></p>



<h3>3. Belts as a Tool for Dividing</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy-829x1030.jpg" alt="Fred Astaire with a tie belt" class="wp-image-60724" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy-829x1030.jpg 829w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy-362x450.jpg 362w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy-768x954.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy-1208x1500.jpg 1208w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy-568x705.jpg 568w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Fred-Astaire-with-a-tie-belt-copy.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fred-astaire-gentleman-of-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Fred Astaire (opens in a new tab)">Fred Astaire</a> emphasizing the division between top and bottom halves with a tie belt</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another aspect of your waistline that plays a significant role in dividing as a style technique is your average, everyday belt. Many of us wear a belt all the time, without realizing that it actually strengthens the division between top and bottom halves. That&rsquo;s why a really formal suit or a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/" target="_blank">tuxedo</a> will not have a belt, but rather side adjusters on the pants. For one thing, a leather strap makes your pants more casual, but this is because the belt breaks your outfit in half: you&rsquo;re adding a strong focal point to your waist, usually in a different color than your shirt, jacket or pants, that disrupts the flow of top and bottom.</p>



<p>This is the opposite principle than that which applies to wearing a wide cummerbund or a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/classic/evening-waistcoat-vest-cummerbund/">waistcoat</a> to cover your waistband when wearing a tux. These are tricks to create more flow between your upper and lower halves, which makes your outfit more formal. You have black pants and a black jacket brought together with a black <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cummerbund (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/evening-wear-tuxedo-black-tie-white-tie/cummerbunds" target="_blank">cummerbund</a> or waistcoat. So, if you want to keep your look really formal, avoid dividing with a belt; use suspenders or side adjusters instead. On the other hand. if you want to dress down your outfit, definitely add a belt.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Belt-loops.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Belt-loops-1030x687.jpg" alt="Belt loops on pants" class="wp-image-102421" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Belt-loops-1030x687.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Belt-loops-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Belt-loops-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Belt-loops-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Belt-loops-705x470.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>Belts create more of an interruption between top and bottom</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One instance when a belt is directly used to create a division between your top and bottom halves is when your shirt and pants are the same color, or close to the same. The most common way this happens is in the summer, if you wear <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-white-menswear/" target="_blank">white</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-off-white/" target="_blank">off-white</a> pants with a white shirt (in the Italian style) and a lightweight sport coat. Without a belt to form a dividing line, the continuous swath of white down the middle of your outfit looks unusual. In this case, a belt with strong features&ndash;braided, alligator leather, or colored cloth&ndash;is called for. You can also use this technique to create more distinction between shirt and pants that are just slightly off from one another, most likely a white shirt with off-white trousers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Franco-Mazzetti.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Franco-Mazzetti.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-111066" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Franco-Mazzetti.jpg 586w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Franco-Mazzetti-416x450.jpg 416w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.instagram.com/franz_1955/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Franco Mazzetti</a> showing how to use a belt to divide a white shirt and pants combination</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Intermediate: Layering with Vests to Create Separation</h2>



<p>A different kind of division is created whenever you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-layer-clothes/" target="_blank">layer</a> with an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/men-waistcoats-odd-vest-how-to-wear/" target="_blank">odd (non-matching) vest</a> that is not part of a three-piece suit. This is because a layer in a different color, pattern or fabric creates a visual break with whatever is next to it. As a basic example, if you&rsquo;re wearing a white shirt and a navy suit jacket, you can pop on a sky blue knit vest to create a division between the two. The break is especially important in two situations. The first is if you have a tie that is the same pattern as your jacket&ndash;wearing the two together would look unusual. Throw on a solid waistcoat or knit vest in any color and you create an immediate division between the two to make the combination very wearable. It&rsquo;s like making a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1594744386?tag=gentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow">sandwich</a>&ndash;the two pieces of &ldquo;bread&rdquo; are now separated by the &ldquo;food&rdquo; in-between.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Alternating-Patterns.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Alternating-Patterns.jpg" alt="Alternating solids and patterns." class="wp-image-66927" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Alternating-Patterns.jpg 500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Alternating-Patterns-337x450.jpg 337w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a><figcaption>Alternating solids and patterns.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The second situation is if you have a tie that is similar in color, but still somewhat different, from the color of your pants or your jacket. Wearing them together can look wrong because the colors are close but slightly &ldquo;off.&rdquo; If you put on a knit vest in another color, however, the layer creates a visual separation that disguises the difference, tricking the eye into ignoring the dissimilarity. </p>

<h2>Advanced: The Spezzato Technique</h2>



<p>The most sophisticated use of dividing as a stylistic technique is <em><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/spezzato-how-divide-suit/">spezzato</a></em>. The technique involves taking the top of one suit (the jacket) and combining it with the bottom of another suit (the trousers). It can also be done with a three-piece suit, by wearing the matching vest and pants from one suit with the jacket of another, or the vest and jacket of one suit with a different pair of pants.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants-687x1030.jpg" alt="Spezzato with vest and pants" class="wp-image-100990" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants-687x1030.jpg 687w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants-470x705.jpg 470w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spezzato-with-vest-and-pants.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px"></a><figcaption>Spezzato achieved with matching vest and trousers and a different jacket</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is like making a sport-coat-and-trouser combination, but mixing and matching from a pair of suits instead. It&rsquo;s a great way to add versatility to your existing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="wardrobe (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/capsule-wardrobe-guide/" target="_blank">wardrobe</a>. The key to success with this form of division is to choose the same sort of material for top and bottom&ndash;both wool, for example&ndash;and also in the same weight and cut. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to mix a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="summer suit (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-suits-new/" target="_blank">summer suit</a> jacket with flannel trousers or a full-cut jacket with slim-fit pants. Another necessity is selecting a suit jacket that resembles a sport coat, like one with natural shoulders and patch pockets. Lastly, be careful not to use the technique of dividing a suit as an excuse to wear a suit jacket with shorts, sweat pants, or even jeans. While this will definitely create a sharp division between top and bottom, it&rsquo;ll be noticed for all the wrong reasons: because it looks ridiculous.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Dividing is not likely something we think about consciously when approaching classic menswear, but it&rsquo;s a proven technique that can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Beginners can focus on different quadrants or zones of an outfit to divide and conquer their style. On an intermediate level, you can use a vest or play with your waistline to good effect. Once you&rsquo;ve mastered this and have a solid collection of suits, you can try the advanced approach of <em>spezzato</em>. Keeping division in mind as a style tool, you open the door to a range of new possibilities.</p>

The original purpose of these outfits was to be special <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-dress-code-primer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dress codes (opens in a new tab)">dress codes</a> that left behind the dirt and grime of the day&rsquo;s work that would accompany clothes worn during the day. In other words, they were really set aside to be unique. </p>



<p>After the invention of the automobile and other modern conveniences, of course, the strict segregation between day clothes and evening clothes fell away somewhat in terms of practicality but the distinctions remained purely in terms of aesthetics. In the Victorian era, white tie was expected to be worn at every evening function where women would be present and black tie was only appropriate for less formal stag affairs. </p>

<p>Between the world wars, the tuxedo largely supplanted the tailcoat as standard evening wear and the tailcoat then became relegated to extremely formal evening functions. After World War II, the business suit became acceptable for semi-formal and even some formal gatherings both night and day. This meant that all formal wear became increasingly limited to only the most formal of events. </p>



<p>Even today, it&rsquo;s still commonly accepted that the tuxedo and the tailcoat shouldn&rsquo;t be seen in broad daylight. Because this can be hard to avoid in some parts of the globe during the summer months, however, evening is alternatively defined as either sundown or 6:00 p.m., whichever comes first. Whatever the case, unless you happen to be a man who is working in the service or entertainment industries, the only acceptable scenario for being seen in a tuxedo or tailcoat in broad daylight is if you&rsquo;re traveling to an event where these dress codes will be worn and you don&rsquo;t also have a change of clothes.  Also, there are a handful of state functions in Europe where tuxedos are worn in the daytime, although these are rare. In the United Kingdom, Western Europe, and Japan, the persistence of formal daywear as a viable dress code has meant that tuxedos and tailcoats are still not really seen until the evening, in most circumstances. In the US though, morning dress has all but disappeared and most Americans now commonly think of the tuxedo as being all-purpose formal wear. You don&rsquo;t have to look any further than daytime weddings for this to be evident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, most formal affairs where the hosts have chosen to institute Black Tie as the formal dress code will explicitly state as much on their invitations. A few occasions where evening wear is expected or even welcomed still do exist outside of this invitation paradigm, however, and they&rsquo;re the ones we&rsquo;re going to cover in today&rsquo;s guide.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mira-Sorvino-at-the-Opera-Ball-in-Vienna-2013-1030x682.jpg" alt="Mira Sorvino at the Opera Ball in Vienna 2013" class="wp-image-107535" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mira-Sorvino-at-the-Opera-Ball-in-Vienna-2013-1030x682.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mira-Sorvino-at-the-Opera-Ball-in-Vienna-2013-450x298.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mira-Sorvino-at-the-Opera-Ball-in-Vienna-2013-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mira-Sorvino-at-the-Opera-Ball-in-Vienna-2013-1500x994.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mira-Sorvino-at-the-Opera-Ball-in-Vienna-2013-705x467.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mira-Sorvino-at-the-Opera-Ball-in-Vienna-2013.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"><figcaption>Mira Sorvino at the Opera Ball in Vienna 2013</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Public Events &amp; Entertainment</h3>



<p>Historically, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="opera (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/etiquette-when-attending-a-performance/" target="_blank">opera</a> has been considered the most prestigious of all of the performing arts and as such, men would dress accordingly when in attendance. While the days of mandatory tailcoats for attending the opera are long gone, it&rsquo;s not out of the question, especially in major metropolitan cities to see some particularly well-dressed men attending the opera in Black Tie or even sometimes White. Premiere performances of the ballet, symphony, and theatre are also often <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Black Tie optional (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/etiquette/black-tie-optional-dress-code/" target="_blank">Black Tie optional</a>. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.49.19-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.49.19-PM-633x1030.png" alt="Preston Schlueter - Black Tie ensemble" class="wp-image-116104" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.49.19-PM-633x1030.png 633w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.49.19-PM-276x450.png 276w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.49.19-PM-433x705.png 433w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.49.19-PM.png 659w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px"></a><figcaption>Preston Schlueter &ndash; Black Tie ensemble</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>DEBUTANTE Balls / Proms</h3>



<p>Private Black Tie events do remain relatively popular, however, these are often large dinner dances or other events given by corporations or fraternal organizations.&nbsp;And as the middle-class equivalent to the debutante ball, the prom will often feature a much more loose definition of what we would call formal dress. So while most might choose ensembles with loud colors and cheap fabrics, the young man who wears a properly styled <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tuxedo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suit-vs-tuxedo-part-i/" target="_blank">tuxedo</a> to his prom is going to stand head and shoulders above the others.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.45.05-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.45.05-PM-1030x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-116101" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.45.05-PM-1030x579.png 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.45.05-PM-450x253.png 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.45.05-PM-768x432.png 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.45.05-PM-1500x844.png 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.45.05-PM-705x397.png 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></div>



<h3>Quincea&ntilde;era</h3>



<p>The Quincea&ntilde;era or celebration commemorating a Latin American girl&rsquo;s rise to 15 years of age, essentially similar in format to a more American sweet 16 party, is often Black Tie Optional in nature, as well. Here&rsquo;s a side note, formal evening wear is typically intended for adult occasions so tailcoats and tuxedos are discouraged to be worn by preteen boys. An exception here is weddings, though in these specific circumstances, really only the junior ushers should be wearing tuxedos that are the same as the other members of the wedding party. Here&rsquo;s a simple way to think of this rule, if a boy is too young to be able to properly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tie a bowtie (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-tie-a-bow-tie/" target="_blank">tie a bowtie</a> himself, then he&rsquo;s too young to wear one.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wedding-party-in-tuxedos-1030x580.jpg" alt="Groomsmen in tuxedos" class="wp-image-62457" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wedding-party-in-tuxedos-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wedding-party-in-tuxedos-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wedding-party-in-tuxedos-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wedding-party-in-tuxedos-705x397.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wedding-party-in-tuxedos.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"><figcaption>Groomsmen in tuxedos</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Weddings</h3>



<p>On the topic of weddings,however, marriage ceremonies are still generally held to more formal standards than other events and a formal evening wedding is the grandest of all of these. If you&rsquo;re invited to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="wedding ceremony (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wedding-dress-code-etiquette-guide/" target="_blank">wedding ceremony</a> that begins after 6:00 p.m., usually with a reception to follow, a Black Tie dress code is going to be common, if not white. Such affairs are relatively rare though especially in the United Kingdom where weddings typically aren&rsquo;t held in the evening, as a general rule. The most formal type of wedding ceremony that the average man is likely to attend is only going to require tuxedos of the groomsmen and usually just formally styled <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="suits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-many-suits-does-a-man-need/" target="_blank">suits</a> for every other man.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Tie-Dinner-Party-1952.jpg" alt="A black-tie dinner party, c. 1952." class="wp-image-105485" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Tie-Dinner-Party-1952.jpg 699w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Tie-Dinner-Party-1952-377x450.jpg 377w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Black-Tie-Dinner-Party-1952-590x705.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"><figcaption>A black-tie dinner party, c. 1952.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Ocean Cruises</h3>



<p>Now let&rsquo;s get into some more rare and unique situations starting with evenings at sea. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Ocean cruises (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/outfits-at-sea/" target="_blank">Ocean cruises</a> do often still provide a man an opportunity to wear a tuxedo. In fact, some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cruise lines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cruise-ship-primer/" target="_blank">cruise lines</a> pride themselves on their attention to the details of formality even encouraging guests to dress up on the ship after 6 p.m. Some cruise lines will offer onboard formal wear rentals as well for those passengers who didn&rsquo;t bring a formal ensemble. The number of formal nights on a cruise line can vary widely depending on the line and the itinerary, however, and for example, the first and last nights of a cruise generally, are never formal because on those nights, most of the luggage of the passengers is going to be packed away. Days in port are also similarly informal because they often wouldn&rsquo;t provide passengers enough time to change before <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dinner (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/table-etiquette-guide-informal-dining-manners/" target="_blank">dinner</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.52.43-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.52.43-PM-1030x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-116106" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.52.43-PM-1030x579.png 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.52.43-PM-450x253.png 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.52.43-PM-768x432.png 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.52.43-PM-1500x844.png 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-6.52.43-PM-705x397.png 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></div>



<h3>Fraternal Organization Events</h3>



<p>If a man belongs to a fraternal organization, he may have a few more opportunities than usual to wear formal wear as well. Prestigious universities such as Cambridge and Oxford and organizations like the Masons will often have their members don full dress for particularly special occasions.These groups may have their own specific versions of formal wear codes, however, which means that what the men are wearing is really more of a uniform than true formal wear.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Diplomatic Functions</h3>



<p>Now, the average man probably won&rsquo;t find himself being invited to too many diplomatic functions but just in case, here&rsquo;s a brief overview. While White Tie gatherings remain a tradition in the royal courts of Europe, American presidents have only held two White Tie dinners since 1989. President George W Bush also did away with the custom of wearing White Tie to the reception for the Diplomatic Corps in 2001. More often than not then, White House functions today are typically Black Tie affairs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Invitation-Black-Tie.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Invitation-Black-Tie-900x683.jpg" alt="Invitation Black Tie" class="wp-image-49937" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Invitation-Black-Tie-900x683.jpg 900w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Invitation-Black-Tie-450x342.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Invitation-Black-Tie-768x583.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Invitation-Black-Tie-1500x1138.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Invitation-Black-Tie-705x535.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></a><figcaption>Invitation Black Tie</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>What is the surest way to know when you should wear Black Tie or White Tie?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In simplest terms, just consult your invitation. Prior to World War II, it was considered a faux pas to explicitly state a dress code on an invitation because of the universal understandings of what clothing to wear when that we mentioned at the beginning of the video. Today, however, especially in the United States, so few parties are truly formal in nature that mindful hosts will be sure to include a dress code on the invitation. Even so, in recent decades, hosts have begun to needlessly complicate things a little bit with more ambiguous variations of the traditional dress codes.&nbsp; And if a dress code isn&rsquo;t printed on an invitation and you&rsquo;re still unsure, just talk to your hosts directly and ask them what they&rsquo;d prefer, you&rsquo;ll be glad you did!&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now that you know the occasions where wearing Black Tie and White Tie is appropriate and even preferred, you should be able to seek them out if you&rsquo;d like and look your best while you&rsquo;re there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sandals hold a bit of an odd place in the world of menswear. On one hand, they&rsquo;re obviously a very old type of footwear; but on the other hand, they&rsquo;re not really present in the classical western men&rsquo;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="wardrobe (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-maintain-your-wardrobe/" target="_blank">wardrobe</a>. True, the ancient Romans and Greeks all wore sandals, yet wearing a pair of sandals with a suit is not something you&rsquo;ll see today. Read on to learn our thoughts on this distinct type of footwear.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="avia-iframe-wrap"><iframe title="Sandals, Flip Flops, Birkenstocks for Men: Should You Wear Mandals" width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c12L7_jZ8o8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure><p> Sandals for men are sometimes also referred to as &ldquo;<em>mandals</em>,&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re the subject of an ongoing debate&ndash;especially when worn with socks.&nbsp; Let us start by saying you can wear whatever you want, whenever you want in this day and age. So the real question is this: would a dapper gentleman consider sandals to be in good taste?&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Evolution Of Sandals</h2>



<p>The word originates from the Greek word <em>sandalon</em> or <em>sandalion</em>. Sandals are defined as shoes that leave most of your foot exposed, but beyond that, there&rsquo;s no universal definition for the word. Going back, the earliest known pair of men&rsquo;s sandals in the world are over 10,000 years old. They were made from sagebrush bark. Greek and Roman soldiers were known to fight in sandals known as <em>buskins</em>. Going back hundreds or thousands of years in history, many men wore sandals.However, in more recent history, sandals have pretty much fallen out of favor for the classic well-dressed man. </p>

<p>So how did that change come about? Partly, it was because <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-make-shoes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">shoemaking</a> got a lot more sophisticated than just slapping a few pieces of leather or bark onto your foot. It&rsquo;s also likely that the climate in Europe contributed to the fact that a closed-toed shoe has been the standard for men for over a hundred years in Europe and the Western Hemisphere. Of course, each country and culture will have its own standards and there is no universal truth. </p>



<p>Also, if you think about it, most places that experience temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter (10 degrees Celsius) will probably not want to wear sandals all year round. Looking back at the 1930s and 1940s, which are often considered to be the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="golden era of classic menswear (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentlemen-golden-age-ebook/" target="_blank">golden era of classic menswear</a>, you will have a very hard time finding men wearing sandals. All the illustrations and photos from magazines usually show men either barefoot on the beach, or sometimes wearing espadrilles. If you look at Cary Grant in the photo below, you&rsquo;ll see that he was wearing socks, but not sandals. </p>

<p>It was really much more common to see men wearing <a aria-label="loafers (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/loafer-guide-penny-gucci-tassels-weejuns/" target="_blank">loafers</a>, sometimes with socks, even when they wore shorts or espadrilles (which have fallen somewhat out of favor, especially in the US, even though in places like Spain or Italy, they&rsquo;re more prevalent). Today, probably the most popular sandals are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="flip-flops (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/things-men-should-never-wear/" target="_blank">flip-flops</a>. In the US, they didn&rsquo;t really become popular until the 1960s but these days, you can see men wearing them all over the place.</p>



<h2>To Wear Or Not To Wear Sandals</h2>



<p>Have you ever seen an outfit based around or incorporating sandals that you thought looked better than if it would have incorporated regular shoes? Put simply: we haven&rsquo;t. If you can come up with something, please share in the comments below! At the end of the day, if you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="care about style (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/101-things-that-change-when-you-dress-up/" target="_blank">care about style</a> and you want to achieve a classy look, we strongly suggest you stay clear of sandals in most situations. </p>



<p>Why do we say most? Well, there are always exceptions. For example: if you&rsquo;re at the beach, the pool, or a spa area&ndash;of course, that&rsquo;s when you can feel free to wear sandals such as flip-flops. When it&rsquo;s practical and it makes sense and the climate around you commands it, absolutely. But anywhere else? There are a number of reasons not to wear them, and we&rsquo;ll list them here.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/birkenstock-brown-Arizona-Sandals-In-Mocha-Suede.jpeg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/birkenstock-brown-Arizona-Sandals-In-Mocha-Suede-807x1030.jpeg" alt="Birkenstock" class="wp-image-115776" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/birkenstock-brown-Arizona-Sandals-In-Mocha-Suede-807x1030.jpeg 807w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/birkenstock-brown-Arizona-Sandals-In-Mocha-Suede-353x450.jpeg 353w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/birkenstock-brown-Arizona-Sandals-In-Mocha-Suede-768x980.jpeg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/birkenstock-brown-Arizona-Sandals-In-Mocha-Suede-553x705.jpeg 553w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/birkenstock-brown-Arizona-Sandals-In-Mocha-Suede.jpeg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px"></a><figcaption>Birkenstock</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>1. They Look Really Cheap.</h3>



<p>Just think of Tevas, Birkenstocks, or flip-flops. Most of them are made out of cheap materials, and that&rsquo;s what they look like: cheap. Even if you try to &ldquo;upgrade,&rdquo; and you invest a few hundred dollars in Salvatore Ferragamo flip-flops, they&rsquo;re still just that: flip-flops. When I grew up in Germany in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s, Birkenstocks were a traditional house shoe and nothing else. No one would ever dare to wear them on the street until they became more popular in the US. Models and stars like Heidi Klum would wear them in public, and so it became more and more acceptable to wear theem out and about. But back in the day, people would have been ashamed to be seen in the street like that. </p>



<p>Because most sandals lack the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="structure of a dress shoe (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/anatomy-of-a-dress-shoe/" target="_blank">structure of a dress shoe</a>, they&rsquo;re oftentimes glued and use very inexpensive materials such as plastic or rubber heel caps, and other materials that are not high-end. Of course, there are exceptions, and we found some really nice high-end sandals (more on those below).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Take-care-of-your-feet-so-no-one-has-to-see-this.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Take-care-of-your-feet-so-no-one-has-to-see-this-900x675.jpg" alt="Take care of your feet so no one has to see this" class="wp-image-49013" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Take-care-of-your-feet-so-no-one-has-to-see-this-900x675.jpg 900w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Take-care-of-your-feet-so-no-one-has-to-see-this-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Take-care-of-your-feet-so-no-one-has-to-see-this-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Take-care-of-your-feet-so-no-one-has-to-see-this-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Take-care-of-your-feet-so-no-one-has-to-see-this-705x529.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></a><figcaption>Take care of your feet so no one has to see this!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>2. Most Men Don&rsquo;t Have Pretty Feet.</h3>



<p>Now, most women I know really take good care of their feet, it&rsquo;s just something they know they want to pay attention to, because oftentimes they wear sandals that expose their feet and they literally want to put their best foot forward. However, the same isn&rsquo;t true for men. Hairy toes, <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/leather-goods/small-leather-goods/mens-manicure-set-travel-kit-leather-brown-blue-fort-belvedere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ungroomed toenails (opens in a new tab)">ungroomed toenails</a>, calluses, warts, and other such things are just not pretty to look at. Of course, you can go and have a pedicure which is not unusual anymore in today&rsquo;s world. But at the same time, it&rsquo;s a lot of work to keep up with it, and it&rsquo;s still not a very classy look, even if you have a high-end pair of sandals.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Leather-strap-sandals-with-rolled-up-salmon-orange-jeans.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Leather-strap-sandals-with-rolled-up-salmon-orange-jeans-900x600.jpg" alt="Leather strap sandals with rolled up salmon -orange jeans" class="wp-image-15292" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Leather-strap-sandals-with-rolled-up-salmon-orange-jeans-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Leather-strap-sandals-with-rolled-up-salmon-orange-jeans-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Leather-strap-sandals-with-rolled-up-salmon-orange-jeans-705x470.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Leather-strap-sandals-with-rolled-up-salmon-orange-jeans.jpg 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></a><figcaption>Leather strap sandals with rolled up salmon -orange jeans</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>3. No One Wants to Really See Your Feet.</h3>



<p>No one really wants to see your feet (with the exception of the inclinations of a small and particular group). Just think of the person behind you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="on the plane (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/what-to-wear-to-the-airport-when-traveling/" target="_blank">on the plane</a> or on the bus taking off their shoes and putting them right next to you&ndash;frankly, few things are more repulsive.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. They Are A Fashion Faux-Pas.</h3>



<p>Just think of country clubs, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="weddings (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wedding-dress-code-etiquette-guide/" target="_blank">weddings</a>, nice restaurants, or cities in general. These are all not good places to wear sandals. Why? Well, they weren&rsquo;t made for such environments. Of course, if you&rsquo;re at the beach, anywhere that it&rsquo;s wet, or if it&rsquo;s really hot outside, then sandals can be a decent option, even as a man.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sandals-and-Suits-obviously-dont-go-well-together.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sandals-and-Suits-obviously-dont-go-well-together-660x1030.jpg" alt="Sandals and Suits obviously don't go well together" class="wp-image-100678" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sandals-and-Suits-obviously-dont-go-well-together-660x1030.jpg 660w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sandals-and-Suits-obviously-dont-go-well-together-288x450.jpg 288w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sandals-and-Suits-obviously-dont-go-well-together-452x705.jpg 452w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sandals-and-Suits-obviously-dont-go-well-together.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></a><figcaption>Sandals and Suits obviously don&rsquo;t go well together</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>5. Sandals Make You Look Sloppy.</h3>



<p>Sandals are a convenient and casual look that you can just slip onto your feet, but they&rsquo;re not something you&rsquo;d ever want to show up in for an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="interview (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/job-interviewjob-preparation-guide/" target="_blank">interview</a>, for example. Now, if comfort and convenience are very high up on your priority list, ask yourself this: how much longer does it take to put on a comfortable pair of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="boat shoes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/boat-shoes-guide-buy-style-history-care/" target="_blank">boat shoes</a> or espadrilles? Not much, really. Yes, as we mentioned, sandals do have their place: pools, spas, and so forth. But other than that, skip them.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandals.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandals-1030x614.jpg" alt="sandals" class="wp-image-64881" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandals-1030x614.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandals-450x268.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandals-768x457.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandals-705x420.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandals.jpg 1291w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></div>



<h3>6. They Can Be Bad For Your Feet.</h3>



<p>Last but not least, sandals can be bad for your feet in the long term especially if you walk a lot. The lack of structure and arch support is just not beneficial to your feet, as the footbed is usually quite flat. You are also more likely to end up with splinters or dirt on your feet (due to the open constuction), so these are all good reasons to skip the sandals unless it&rsquo;s really necessary to wear them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette Recommends&hellip;</h2>



<p>Obviously, we&rsquo;re not big fans of sandals at the Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette, but sometimes they will be necessary. In those cases, we came up with two different models that even I would wear if the circumstances called for it.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-05-at-6.48.45-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-05-at-6.48.45-PM-1030x579.png" alt="Huarache Sandals" class="wp-image-115778" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-05-at-6.48.45-PM-1030x579.png 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-05-at-6.48.45-PM-450x253.png 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-05-at-6.48.45-PM-768x432.png 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-05-at-6.48.45-PM-1500x844.png 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-05-at-6.48.45-PM-705x397.png 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>Huarache Sandals</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Huarache Sandals</h3>



<p>Huaraches are popular in Mexico, made out of woven leather, and look distinctly casual. Oftentimes, you can find them with either a leather or rubber sole. The model depicted above came from Etsy, and cost just $56.00 shipped to the US. It has a <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/is-it-worth-it-clarks-boots/">crepe sole</a>, and it&rsquo;s a very nice, casual summer shoe that covers most of your foot. However, because the leather is woven and unlined, you still get the airflow you would get with other types of sandals. In our opinion, this is a much better option than most men&rsquo;s sandals out there, especially flip-flops, Tevas, or Birkenstocks.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.church-footwear.com/eu/en/men/style/sandals/products.nevada_leather_sandal.EX0002_9XM_F0AAR_F_000000.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cq5dam.web_.white_.1280x1280-1030x724.jpeg" alt="Church's Fisherman Sandals" class="wp-image-115781" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cq5dam.web_.white_.1280x1280-1030x724.jpeg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cq5dam.web_.white_.1280x1280-450x316.jpeg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cq5dam.web_.white_.1280x1280-768x540.jpeg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cq5dam.web_.white_.1280x1280-705x496.jpeg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cq5dam.web_.white_.1280x1280.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.church-footwear.com/eu/en/men/style/sandals/products.nevada_leather_sandal.EX0002_9XM_F0AAR_F_000000.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Church's Fisherman Sandals (opens in a new tab)">Church&rsquo;s Fisherman Sandals</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Fisherman Sandals</h3>



<p>If you look at this model from <a aria-label="Church's (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/askgg-what-shoe-brands/" target="_blank">Church&rsquo;s</a> which retails for $495, you can see the similarity to a men&rsquo;s dress shoe. It&rsquo;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Goodyear welted (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/what-makes-italian-shoes-different/" target="_blank">Goodyear welted</a>, has a slight heel, is made out of good quality leather, and has a nice lining. Overall, it&rsquo;s a quality pair of footwear that rivals the build quality of regular <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dress shoes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/anatomy-of-a-dress-shoe/" target="_blank">dress shoes</a>. It also has a closed toe, so people won&rsquo;t necessarily see any toes or toe hair, but still with a good amount of airflow, and you can wear them all day long. </p>



<p>That being said, $495 is an awful lot of money to spend on sandals; personally, I&rsquo;d rather invest my money in a woven leather <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="penny loafer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/loafer-guide-penny-gucci-tassels-weejuns/" target="_blank">penny loafer</a>, for example. I think loafers are just better <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="summer shoes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/mens-summer-shoes-guide/" target="_blank">summer shoes</a> with a more refined look. In the case of the Huarache sandals, I can see myself wearing them; for $56, they don&rsquo;t break the bank, and would be perfect for those one or two occasions when I might need them per year or per season. Of course, if you live in an area directly by the beach, then it&rsquo;s true that you&rsquo;ll need more sandals&ndash;but at the Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette, we don&rsquo;t really focus on beachwear style (<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/beach-formal-wedding-dress-code/">often, anyway</a>).</p>



<h2>How To Look Good In Sandals</h2>



<p>It&rsquo;s our position that sandals for men look best when worn with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="shorts (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-shorts-guide/" target="_blank">shorts</a>, or maybe a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="polo shirt (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/polo-shirt-guide/" target="_blank">polo shirt</a>. Alternatively, it might be so hot at the beach that you won&rsquo;t even need them. If you purchase a pair of fisherman sandals, you could conceivably get away with wearing them with a pair of linen pants, or a pair of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="seersucker (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/seersucker-fabric-suits-origins/" target="_blank">seersucker</a> pants or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="slacks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/features-of-a-pair-of-pants/" target="_blank">slacks</a> that are longer. Whatever the case, it would need to be to be a distinct <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="summer fabric (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-fabrics-guide/" target="_blank">summer fabric</a>; otherwise, it would just look out of place. One thing you should always avoid is to wear your sandals with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="socks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/socks" target="_blank">socks</a>&ndash;and yes, I know many of my German countrymen do this, but it&rsquo;s just an awful look that should simply never happen, even if you don&rsquo;t care much about style.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For thousands of years, men of influence have been donning a wearable form of identification and communication known as the signet ring. Today, it&rsquo;s simply an attractive accessory that any man can wear. We&rsquo;ll explore how.</p>



<span id="more-30688"></span>



<h2>What is a Signet Ring?</h2>



<p>Have you ever wondered why some men wear engraved rings on their ring or pinky finger? It is a signet ring.  Signet rings have been a practical part of men&rsquo;s fashion for thousands of years. For wealthy and important men, a signet ring was a powerful tool akin to a signature. A signet ring is set apart from other rings based on an engraved or raised symbol, series of words or letters, or image on the top half of the ring that was representative of its wearer in some way.

<p>Historically, signet rings played a significant role in business and politics. Used as a seal, a <a title="What It Means To Be A Gentleman Today" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-what-it-means-today/">gentleman</a> would use his ring featuring his unique family crest, emblem or monogram to stamp important documents. By dipping the ring into hot wax or soft clay, the ring left a distinct seal that was considered, at the time, to be more official than that of a signature.</p>



<p>Used on a global scale by the world&rsquo;s leaders and monumental men, the ring was seen as a way to prove authenticity. They are often referred to as seal rings today.</p>

<p>The ring itself had markings on it that identified the specific person or the family of the person wearing it. Sometimes this was a family crest or a coat of arms, but other times it was nothing more than an icon or a monogram that was associated with a family.</p>

<p>The ring was made in mirrored image to ensure it came out properly when leaving its mark or impression. Therefore, the rings are often difficult to make and cost a significant amount of money.</p>

<p>Signet rings have been used since as far back as 3500 BC when the people of Mesopotamia began using them as a method of authenticity. Initially, a seal as opposed to a ring, it was a cylindrical device that was rolled across wet clay leaving a distinct impression in the clay. Used to seal a variety of envelopes, jars, and packages, they also functioned in the same way as corporate seals do today, and of course, this is where the corporate seal comes from.</p>

<p>In Ancient Egypt, pharaohs, religious leaders, and nobles would wear the rings made of stone or pottery called faience. The rings were flat on the outside and ornate with decorations and symbols used to denote its owner.</p>

<p>In fact, the Old Testament even mentions signet rings in the story of Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s den&hellip;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. (Daniel 6:17)</p></blockquote>



<p>In the Early Minoan age, the rings were formed out of soft stones and ivory. Come the Middle Minoan age they were made of harder stone, and by the Late Bronze age, they had become the signet rings we would recognize today. During the Hellenistic period (323 BC &ndash; 31 AD), they were considered an art form in addition to being used for a purpose. Around the same time. King Mithridates VI of Pontus was an avid collector of signet rings.</p>

<p>Despite some people having signet rings that were handed down, most of them are quite modern. For many centuries, the ring would be destroyed when the owner passed, and because they were worn by noblemen, they weren&rsquo;t copied and were considered very valuable, hence their name &ldquo;signet&rdquo; which is translated to mean &ldquo;a small seal employed for formal or official purpose&rdquo;.</p>

<p>By the middle ages and well into the nineteenth century, most men wore these rings with some form of a badge on the flat side. With the King&rsquo;s signet being the most prized signet in the world, all men viewed their rings as important artifacts. It was a mark of elitism, class and that you were a member of the superior society of men if you had a true signet ring. </p>



<p>Despite legal documents being around, the art of handwriting was not and that&rsquo;s one reason why the signet ring was so vital and important to members of society who would be responsible for signing such documents. Since the ring was so powerful, it was sometimes destroyed when the man died and often a ceremony or ritual was performed.</p>

<p>The first signet rings were made with raised decoration and lettering whereas, following the development of sealing wax, it was actually made with a depressed design.</p>



<p>The image would be left when the ring was pressed into it, therefore, had to be resilient to wear and damage. Often the rings would be made of gold or silver with the design cast, rather than carved into the flat end of the ring.</p>

<p>Although large in size, they were also intended as a symbol of class and wealth. Due to the considerable cost, many families had a single ring that was handed down from father to son &ndash; only the very wealthy or important members of society had rings exclusive to them. This included the king, religious leaders, doctors of medicine, barristers and solicitors as well as other noblemen.</p>



<p>With the popularity of the rings increasing, many families would keep these heavy and large rings in family jewel boxes as they became more ornate and decorated over the years. Many times men would opt not to wear them on their finger and instead mounted them on chains or the fob of their pocket watch.</p>

<p>As the nineteenth century approached, men began to engrave precious stones such as rubies, bloodstone and other semi-precious gems fastened to their ring. Made of equally important metals such as gold and silver, the solid metal varieties traditionally had raised emblems with a cable border.</p>

<p>FDR came from a well-to-do American family, and such families often copied the European tradition of wearing signet rings. FDR wore his in the British style, stacked over his wedding ring on his pinky finger after he inherited it from his father. His signet ring was admired by Winston Churchill. </p>



<h2>The Signet Ring Today</h2>



<p>Today the signet ring doesn&rsquo;t hold much meaning in society anymore. It&rsquo;s more of a fashion statement or family heirloom handed down from one generation to the next. The Royal family in England and other aristocratic families in Europe represent a few types of people you might expect to see wearing an authentic, inherited signet ring.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PrinceCharlesPrinceWalesSupportsWWFGreenm29H2QEmEnnx.jpg" alt="Prince+Charles+Prince+Wales+Supports+WWF+Green+m29H2QEmEnnx" class="wp-image-59142" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PrinceCharlesPrinceWalesSupportsWWFGreenm29H2QEmEnnx.jpg 681w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PrinceCharlesPrinceWalesSupportsWWFGreenm29H2QEmEnnx-299x450.jpg 299w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PrinceCharlesPrinceWalesSupportsWWFGreenm29H2QEmEnnx-469x705.jpg 469w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px"><figcaption>Prince Charles has developed a characteristic look over the years that includes double-breasted peaked lapel suits and his Prince of Wales signet ring </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are still those who commission a ring maker to create a family signet ring, but most men who own the traditional signet rings inherited them from their ancestors and will eventually hand it down to the next generation. Therefore, the ring isn&rsquo;t a true mark of them as an individual, but of someone else in the line.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/signet-ring-lagenstein-blau-on-ring-finger-left-hand.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/signet-ring-lagenstein-blau-on-ring-finger-left-hand-1030x581.jpg" alt="An engraved signet ring worn on the ring finger" class="wp-image-98398" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/signet-ring-lagenstein-blau-on-ring-finger-left-hand-1030x581.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/signet-ring-lagenstein-blau-on-ring-finger-left-hand-450x254.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/signet-ring-lagenstein-blau-on-ring-finger-left-hand-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/signet-ring-lagenstein-blau-on-ring-finger-left-hand-1500x846.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/signet-ring-lagenstein-blau-on-ring-finger-left-hand-705x397.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>An engraved signet ring worn on the ring finger</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Many world leaders opted to wear these rings on a daily basis whereas others stowed them safely away. Today, variations of signet rings still occur with many Freemasons wearing a marked ring identifying themselves to others. Many other clubs and organizations offer seal rings as well.</p>



<p>In most cases today it&rsquo;s a matter of personal style when a man wears a signet ring. </p>



<p>Some clubs, corporations, and families continue to give seal rings as gifts upon a certain length of service, a graduation or a commendation. Many military men wear signet rings that reflect their rank as a status symbol whereas others wear symbolic rings to showcase the branch they served with.</p>



<h2>No Family Crest? No Problem!</h2>



<p>If you like the design or the concept of a signet ring but your family doesn&rsquo;t have a coat of arms, should you get one? Legally, the answer is clear. Anyone can go out and create a ring with their own coat of arms and some people who are traditionalists may argue that it is more the sign of an impostor because you pretend to be part of the nobility or of a class of society that you are in fact not.</p>



<p>While certain families have had coat of arms and family crests for generations, they all started at one point in time and just because your family didn&rsquo;t have one, and you really want one for your family, we think it&rsquo;s legitimate to simply start a new tradition. Of course, the design is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Personally, my family never had a crest and I never felt the need to create a signet ring with something that was so personalized and old-fashioned. I really like to wear rings and I even have a bunch of rings in my collection that are made to be Signet rings; I simply prefer them without an engraving.</p>

<h2>Should You Get A Signet Ring? It&rsquo;s Up To You!</h2>



<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s entirely up to you. It&rsquo;s a unique piece of jewelry and as a man, besides your wedding band and maybe your collar pin or a tie pin or your cufflinks, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of jewelry you can wear and still appear elegant. </p>

<h2>What Finger Should You Wear Your Signet Ring On? </h2>



<p>There are no hard and fast rules, so you can wear a ring on any finger you choose! That being said, there are many traditions about<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/what-rings-mean-on-each-finger/"> which fingers rings should go on</a>. In Britain, traditionally, the signet ring is worn on the pinky finger of the left hand. During Victorian times, men would wear their pinky ring and their wedding band stacked together on the left pinky finger. Winston Churchill wore his signet on his right ring finger. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger.jpeg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger-1030x639.jpeg" alt="Britain Churchill Soviets" class="wp-image-98407" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger-1030x639.jpeg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger-450x279.jpeg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger-768x477.jpeg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger-705x438.jpeg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>Churchill smoking his trademark cigars with his signet ring on his right hand</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In Britain, there&rsquo;s a clear preference for the pinky finger of the left hand but ultimately,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s entirely up to you. For example, I wear my wedding band on the left ring finger which is right next to a pinky finger, so I don&rsquo;t wear a ring immediately next to it. I wear my rings (aside from my wedding band) on my right ring or pinky fingers. </p>



<h2>Signet Ring Metal &amp; Style Options</h2>



<p>Most rings come in 10, 14, or 18 karat gold. Either a white gold or rose gold or yellow gold. You can also go with sterling silver which is a lot less&nbsp;expensive but also with things like palladium which are more expensive.</p>



<p>Most rings come with a flat stone on top that can be engraved. If you don&rsquo;t like a center stone, you can also go with simple metal. Traditional shapes include round, oval, or long oval, or rectangular, squares with rounded edges, or even like cut edges that gives you an octagonal look, there really is no limit under the sun as long as the stone is flat and not domed.</p>

<h2>Signet Ring Shapes</h2>



<p>There are six shapes most commonly available in signet rings, with of course others that have been introduced over the years. Here are the popular six which have lasted through time:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Round</strong>: an elegant, traditional shape</li><li><strong>Straight Oval</strong>:  by and large the most popular signet ring shape, it&rsquo;s very easy for the engraver to work with</li><li><strong>Oxford</strong>: a heavy, square-ish ring that takes the shape of a solid square or rectangle with rounded corners</li><li><strong>Bulbous Oval</strong>: a heavier, more distinctive looking ring that is nearly round </li><li><strong>Octagon</strong>: a very modern, far less traditional ring style </li><li><strong>Cushion</strong>: a favorite shape during the Victorian era,  this is the next most popular style second to the straight oval </li></ul><h2><figure><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Different-Signet-Ring-Engraving-Styles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-98403" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Different-Signet-Ring-Engraving-Styles-1030x540.jpg" alt="" width="1030" height="540" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Different-Signet-Ring-Engraving-Styles-1030x540.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Different-Signet-Ring-Engraving-Styles-450x236.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Different-Signet-Ring-Engraving-Styles-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Different-Signet-Ring-Engraving-Styles-1500x786.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Different-Signet-Ring-Engraving-Styles-705x369.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></h2>

<h2>Engraving &amp; Ring Details</h2>



<p>For a crest, you should decide if you want it raised or engraved. When it comes to engraving, there are different options. You can either have it engraved at all the same<br>depth or the more three-dimensional engraving which takes more time it looks much nicer but it&rsquo;s also more expensive.</p>

<p>Another great detail in rings is where the bottom part of the stone is open or closed.&nbsp;By default, most rings are open so you can see the stones from the bottom. The problem with that is that it just collects dirt over time and it&rsquo;s very difficult to clean so you have the option to close that off with metal but since it uses more material, it&rsquo;s also more expensive.</p>

<h2>Modern Signet Ring Options</h2>



<p>In recent years, technological advancements have allowed for laser-engraved signet rings. Personally, I think it looks cheaper, it&rsquo;s less traditional, and if you opt for a signet ring, you obviously like the tradition and the historic look. For the same reason, I&rsquo;d stay clear of showy diamonds because it&rsquo;s just too loud and it&rsquo;s not really part of the traditional signet ring.</p>

<h2>Where to Buy A Signet Ring</h2>



<p>There are a few options: custom made, vintage, or new. Custom made rings tend to run $2000 &ndash; $5000, while vintage rings can be much less expensive but also much less predictable in terms of price.  For new pieces, consider checking out your local jeweler that caters to men.</p>

</div></figure><h2>What Exactly Is Acne?</h2>



<p>Acne is your skin&rsquo;s reaction to a naturally occurring bacteria that&rsquo;s on the surface of the skin. Everybody has these kinds of bacteria, so the myth that people who suffer from excessive acne are somehow less clean, is just that, a myth unfounded by science. In the case of the acne sufferer, <em>Propionibacterium acnes</em> is the one that will activate on the skin from its normally dormant state causing irritation and then a pimple. More specifically, it&rsquo;s often hair follicles that become clogged with dead skin cells and oils and then become inflamed, not a good thing! </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Acne-on-the-face.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Acne-on-the-face-900x599.jpg" alt="Acne on the face" class="wp-image-48906" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Acne-on-the-face-900x599.jpg 900w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Acne-on-the-face-450x299.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Acne-on-the-face-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Acne-on-the-face-1500x998.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Acne-on-the-face-705x469.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></a><figcaption>A bad case of Acne on the face</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Acne can take different forms depending on how the skin has been irritated such as blackheads, whiteheads, or standard pimples. Hormones and genetics do both play a sizable role in whether or not you&rsquo;re going to suffer from acne so there is a certain element of luck involved. However, the best way to stop acne from forming is to make sure that your skin is healthier, in the first place. Of course, determining whether or not you&rsquo;re more prone to excessive acne is probably going to be unnecessary. After all, if you are more prone, you&rsquo;re likely going to have found out about it already. </p>



<p>In general though, before you embark on any sort of treatment plan, it&rsquo;s going to be a good idea to pay a visit to your dermatologist. As with most medical conditions, it&rsquo;s best to get a professional opinion and see if you do have a more specific type of acne that is best treated in a specific way. For most men though, acne is a condition that can be fairly easily treated with topical over-the-counter products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One additional note here, pay attention to the ingredients in the products you purchase. Some may claim to be good for you but based upon thec omposition of your own skin, they can have ingredients that could react negatively. So if step one is <strong>consulting a dermatologist and figuring out what products are right for you</strong>, step two would be <strong>beginning and maintaining a skincare routine</strong>. Starting and maintaining a routine is probably going to be the single best thing you can do for your skin in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>key components to a good skincare routine</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare.jpeg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare-1030x579.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-116038" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare-1030x579.jpeg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare-450x253.jpeg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare-1500x844.jpeg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare-705x397.jpeg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mens-skincare.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></div>



<h3>1. Cleansing</h3>



<p>Using a cleanser to remove excess dirt, grime, oil, bacteria, and other substances on the surface of the skin is going to be helpful. You should try to cleanse both in the morning and the evening. Cleansing alone probably isn&rsquo;t going to be enough to keep skin that&rsquo;s already excessively acne prone from developing more pimples but it&rsquo;s a good first step and for those who only suffer from a regular amount of acne, cleansing will also go a long way.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1115285096.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1115285096-1030x687.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-116039" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1115285096-1030x687.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1115285096-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1115285096-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1115285096-705x470.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1115285096.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></div>



<h3>2. Moisturizing</h3>



<p>Moisturizing after cleansing may seem counterintuitive at first, especially to those with oily skin, after all, if you&rsquo;ve just removed moisture from your skin by cleansing why would you want to add it back? Well, simply stated, you&rsquo;ve removed the dead skin cells, bacteria, and other nasty things from the surface of the skin but you&rsquo;ve also removed the necessary amount of natural oils that your skin has to keep it healthy. </p>



<p>Thus, adding back some good moisture is going to be beneficial and if you do have more oily skin, if you don&rsquo;t moisturize, your body is probably going to overcompensate and produce more oil than it would need to make up for that lost moisture so you&rsquo;ll probably be even more prone to acne thus moisturizing will be your best bet. And while moisturizing is key, especially for those areas that are affected by <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/biggest-shaving-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="shaving (opens in a new tab)">shaving</a> your face, you shouldn&rsquo;t only localize it there. Make sure that you moisturize your entire face. Moisturizing is also a great opportunity to add a product that contains a bit of SPF to your routine.After all, a bit of extra sun protection is never a bad thing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blackheads.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blackheads-1030x579.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-116041" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blackheads-1030x579.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blackheads-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blackheads-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blackheads-705x397.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blackheads.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></div>



<h3>3. Treating the Skin</h3>



<p>For acne-prone men, this is is a two-fold process. The first part here is to exfoliate or use a product that will remove skin cells and buildup in the pores and the second part is to treat the skin with a product that will minimize the amount of bacterial growth on the surface of the skin. To focus in a bit more on exfoliation, there are two main kinds; <strong>physical exfoliation</strong> and <strong>chemical exfoliation</strong>. </p>



<p>Physical exfoliation involves products that use granular particles to actually physically scrub the surface of the skin to remove dead skin cells. While this process can leave the skin feeling exceptionally smooth, it&rsquo;s also easier to over exfoliate when using a physical product. This will create micro tears in your skin which may harbor more bacteria over time. Chemical exfoliation, meanwhile, uses, as you might have guessed, chemicals to remove these dead skin cells. For advanced cases of acne, it may actually be wise to use both a physical and a chemical exfoliant but again, consult your dermatologist if you think this might be the appropriate case.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin-653x900.jpg" alt="Normal skin" class="wp-image-48966" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin-653x900.jpg 653w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin-326x450.jpg 326w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin-768x1059.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin-1088x1500.jpg 1088w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin-511x705.jpg 511w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin-450x621.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Normal-skin.jpg 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px"><figcaption>Normal skin</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>4. Diligence in your Routine</h3>



<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be good enough to do the first three steps only a few times a week.You have to be diligent about this process and make sure that you&rsquo;re doing all the steps as much as necessary. In most cases, twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How to effectively choose skincare products</h2>



<p>It can be a serious drag on both your wallet and your time to find a product that&rsquo;s right for you. The main two things you&rsquo;ll want to try to get better at are reading product reviews online for key information and also reading the ingredient lists of each product to know what to look for. Once you know how to read product reviews and product labels effectively, you&rsquo;ll be able to find products that are right for you that much easier. Also, you&rsquo;ll probably find that both expensive and inexpensive products are often using the same ingredients so you might even be able to save a little bit of money in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Acne-Fighting Ingredients</h2>

<h3>Salicylic Acid</h3>



<p>So then, let&rsquo;s go over some of the main active ingredients in acne fighting products starting with salicylic acid. This is also called beta hydroxy acid or BHA and it&rsquo;s a chemical exfoliant that&rsquo;s a derivative of aspirin. It has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that can help unclog your pores. Salicylic acid is also recommended for razor burn and ingrown hair sufferers for the same reason so it can also be used as part of a shaving routine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>AHA &amp; BHA</h3>



<p>These hydroxy acids are both highly effective for deep exfoliation. AHA and BHA are quite similar but overall, BHA is just a little bit less aggressive.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/100.jpeg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/100-1030x539.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-116049" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/100-1030x539.jpeg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/100-450x235.jpeg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/100-768x402.jpeg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/100-1500x785.jpeg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/100-705x369.jpeg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a></figure></div>



<h3>Retinoids</h3>



<p>This is the term for the family of powerful anti aging molecules derived from vitamin A. Retinol is the most common marketing name of this compound but it can also be listed by various other names such as <em>retinol palmitate, retinaldehyde</em>, or various others. As an antioxidant, it tells old or damaged cells to act like normal ones and is noted to have anti acne benefits. For some users, in addition to its regular anti-aging properties, retinol can be difficult for some men to tolerate, however, so it&rsquo;s best to build up your use of this product slowly over time. Retinol is available over-the-counter in lower concentrations and you can also get a prescription if you need something in a higher concentration. One more tip about retinoids is that they are best to be used at night because they can make the skin more susceptible to damage from the sun.</p>

<h3>Benzoyl Peroxide</h3>



<p>This is a classic anti acne ingredient; It works to reduce the acne causing bacteria on the skin and because it&rsquo;s often found in high concentrations in some products, as much as five or ten percent, it can irritate the skin of some men. So as with retinol, it&rsquo;s best to consult a dermatologist or start with a smaller or lower dose and work your way up over time as necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Sulfur</h3>



<p>Of course, you may be aware of it because of its famous smell which is similar to rotten eggs and therefore, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it would be a great choice for a product that&rsquo;s going on your face. However, sulfur is known for its acne fighting inflammation reducing and exfoliating properties so it&rsquo;s often found in soaps and masks and other similar products where this famous smell is minimized.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Niacinamide</h3>



<p>A product that hasn&rsquo;t traditionally been a part of many anti acne regimens is niacinamide, however, the product is anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and sebostatic which means it helps reduce surface oil on your skin. Furthermore, niacinamide is pH neutral which means it&rsquo;s less irritating to your skin than other common acne fighting ingredients would be. It can also help to reduce acne barring the appearance of fine lines on your face and hyperpigmentation, otherwise known as blotchiness.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WD5J8KY/?tag=gentsgaze-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Ordinary-820x1030.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-116055" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Ordinary-820x1030.jpg 820w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Ordinary-358x450.jpg 358w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Ordinary-768x964.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Ordinary-1194x1500.jpg 1194w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Ordinary-561x705.jpg 561w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Ordinary.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WD5J8KY/?tag=gentsgaze-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" aria-label="The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension (opens in a new tab)">The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Azelaic Acid</h3>



<p>It is a highly effective antioxidant known for its ability to reduce redness and acne in the skin by killing bacteria responsible for inflammation. Also, it&rsquo;s more gentle on the skin than other exfoliants can be.</p>



<h2>General skincare considerations related to acne</h2>



<h3>1. Many skincare products can relieve acne but some can also exacerbate it.</h3>



<p>For example, you shouldn&rsquo;t use any products on your face that have alcohol or fragrances in them. Alcohol is often used as an ingredient in many toners because it feels bracing to the skin but it&rsquo;s also a known irritant so it can make acne worse. Similarly, many fragrances can also be irritating to the skin. On a related note, don&rsquo;t buy a product simply because its label says that it&rsquo;s good for fighting acne; as we&rsquo;ve said before, making sure that you&rsquo;ve read the ingredients list to know what&rsquo;s good and not good for you is going to be the key here.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Expensive does not always mean better.</h3>



<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that the more expensive acne fighting products are automatically going to be better. After all, the principal active ingredients that fight acne are mostly inexpensive so anything that has a high markup is mostly just going to be marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars-1030x555.jpg" alt="Acne scars" class="wp-image-116056" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars-1030x555.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars-450x242.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars-1500x808.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars-705x380.jpg 705w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/acne-scars.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>Acne scars</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>3. Introduce products into your routine slowly.</h3>



<p>This is so that you don&rsquo;t overwhelm or irritate your skin. As some men will naturally have more sensitive skin than others, some might be able to exfoliate and treat more aggressively on a daily basis whereas some could only do it a few times a week.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. What works for others might not work for you.</h3>



<p>Everyone&rsquo;s skin, diet, genetics, and specific needs are different so a skincare routine that has worked wonders for one man isn&rsquo;t necessarily going to automatically work for another. It&rsquo;s important that you consider all of the factors that we have outlined here today before you decide on what skincare routine to use.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>5. Do not expect immediate results.</h3>



<p>Approach it with patience and persistence. After all, not only are there many products on the market so you might have to go through a process of trial and error but even then, once you&rsquo;ve found products that are good for you, they can still take time to work at full effectiveness. Most products and dermatologists will recommend that you allow about six to eight weeks for products to really work as best as they possibly can. We know this can seem like a bit of a long time but once you get up to speed with your skincare routine and everything is working properly, it will definitely be worth it.</p>

<h3>Charcoal Gray</h3>



<p> First on the list is the most formal shade, the so-called charcoal gray. It&rsquo;s dark enough that you can wear it in most functions where you otherwise would think of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="black (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-most-overrated-color-black/" target="_blank">black</a> suit, such as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="funeral (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/funeral-etiquette-clothes-thank-you-cards-flowers/" target="_blank">funeral</a>, a play, or a business event. A charcoal suit is similarly dark to most navy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="suits (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-many-suits-does-a-man-need/" target="_blank">suits</a>; yet, while a navy suit usually makes a younger man look even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="younger (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-look-younger/" target="_blank">younger</a>, a charcoal suit makes you look more <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="mature (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-look-older-than-you-are/" target="_blank">mature</a>.&nbsp;In our opinion, the first charcoal suit you should add to your wardrobe is a charcoal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="flannel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flannel-guide-fall-fabric/" target="_blank">flannel</a> suit. The charcoal flannel suit was popularized by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Gianni Agnelli (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gianni-agnelli-style-gentleman/" target="_blank">Gianni Agnelli</a>,and you can still get the exact fabric he preferred from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Vitale Barberis Canonico (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-fabric-is-made/" target="_blank">Vitale Barberis Canonico</a> today.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-1.46.18-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-1.46.18-PM-1030x579.png" alt="Preston Schlueter wearing his medium gray suit" class="wp-image-115942" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-1.46.18-PM-1030x579.png 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-1.46.18-PM-450x253.png 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-1.46.18-PM-768x432.png 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-1.46.18-PM-1500x844.png 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-1.46.18-PM-705x397.png 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>Preston Schlueter in a medium gray suit</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Medium Gray</h3>



<p>A general rule, not just with gray but with all suiting colors, is this: the lighter the shade, the less formal the suit. Therefore, while a medium gray suit is still appropriate for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="office (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dressing-for-work-office/" target="_blank">office</a> and most other functions mentioned earlier (with the exception of funerals), it has a slightly more casual vibe. This is not a bad thing at all; it just means that when you pair shirts and ties together, you can go with slightly less formal options.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Light Gray</h3>



<p>Following the above rule, the light gray suit is even more casual, yet it&rsquo;s certainly still a suit. This shade works particularly well as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="fresco (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fresco-wool-fabric-suit-outfit/" target="_blank">fresco</a> fabric in the summer, whereby it will have a light breezy feel, and can be worn with even bolder and more summery colors. Of course, any of those gray shades can come in either a striped version, a solid version, or in other small patterns such as a Glen check or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="houndstooth (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/houndstooth-guide/" target="_blank">houndstooth</a>, for example. Sometimes, the fabric texture can also be different such as a fresco, a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="worsted (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/worsted-wool-suiting-guide/" target="_blank">worsted</a>, or a flannel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s another general rule: the more texture your suit has and the larger the pattern, the more casual it is. On the flip side, a solid worsted suit is the most formal one, followed maybe by a flannel or a faintly striped suit in gray. Now, it should go without saying that choosing the right color is just one aspect of finding <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the perfect suit (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-a-suit-should-fit/" target="_blank">the perfect suit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>White Dress Shirt</h3>



<p>The classic staple is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="white (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-white-menswear/" target="_blank">white</a> dress shirt. For a charcoal suit, you probably want something that is very formal; we&rsquo;d suggest a white <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dress shirt (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-shirt-guide/" target="_blank">dress shirt</a> with a medium-spread collar, no breast <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="pocket (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/pockets-complete-guide/" target="_blank">pocket</a>, and French cuffs or double cuffs that are worn with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cufflinks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/cufflinks" target="_blank">cufflinks</a>. Honestly, a white shirt works with any shade of gray suit, no matter if it&rsquo;s really dark, medium, or light. It works so well because it provides a strong contrast which suits most men. </p>



<p>In the case of a medium grey or a lighter gray suit, you can skip the French cuffs, maybe go with a slightly more textured fabric, and perhaps try an even more relaxed collar style, such as a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="button-down collar (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/oxford-cloth-button-down-shirt-ocbd/" target="_blank">button-down collar</a> or an unlined collar&ndash;something that&rsquo;s a bit more casual than a fixed, fused collar.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.27.18-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.27.18-PM-1030x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-115949" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.27.18-PM-1030x579.png 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.27.18-PM-450x253.png 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.27.18-PM-768x432.png 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.27.18-PM-1500x844.png 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.27.18-PM-705x397.png 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>This striped grey suit benefits from a more casual <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/knit-tie-navy-silk-solid-fort-belvedere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="knit tie in navy (opens in a new tab)">knit tie in navy</a> and a pocket square with colorful edging.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you go with a solid gray suit and a solid white shirt, it would be best to add some color with your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tie (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties" target="_blank">tie</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="pocket square (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief" target="_blank">pocket square</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="socks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/socks" target="_blank">socks</a>, or other accessories. A Very classic combination is to add a red tie, maybe a shade of burgundy. If you are not a fan of red and you want to cool down your outfit otherwise, you can go with a navy or blue tie, maybe something in forest green, plum, or even in bronze orange. Basically, any dark-toned tie with a white shirt and a gray suit would be appropriate for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cocktail attire (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cocktail-attire-for-men/" target="_blank">cocktail attire</a>, and if it&rsquo;s a charcoal suit, you can even wear it for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="black tie optional (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/etiquette/black-tie-optional-dress-code/" target="_blank">black tie optional</a> events.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, lighter colored ties will work better with medium and lighter gray suits. Also, in terms of a tie pattern, keep in mind that the smaller the pattern, the more formal it is; since bigger patterns are always less formal, they&rsquo;re better with lighter shades of gray.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Darker Colored Dress Shirts &ndash; A Classic Style &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&rdquo;</h3>



<p>Now, let&rsquo;s quickly talk about a very fashion-forward look: pairing a gray suit with a black shirt. Now, chances are there are a lot of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119439817?tag=gentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow">Instagrammers</a> and influencers trying to tell you that wearing a black shirt is hip, trendy and fashionable. This may be so, but in classic menswear, black dress shirts have never been a viable option. If you want to wear black shirts with a gray suit, go for it&ndash;but we believe that a lighter shirt color that provides a bit more contrast is always more complimentary to your outfit and look. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt.jpg"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt-844x1030.jpg" alt="Ruby red dress shirt - not something we would recommend" class="wp-image-99760" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt-844x1030.jpg 844w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt-369x450.jpg 369w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt-768x938.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt-1229x1500.jpg 1229w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt-577x705.jpg 577w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ruby-red-dress-shirt.jpg 1558w" sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px"></a><figcaption>Ruby red dress shirt &ndash; not something we would recommend for a classic ensemble</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The same is true for any kind of bold, darker colored shirts in hues like red, turquoise, blue, green, or orange. Typically, these are shirts worn by guys who haven&rsquo;t yet learned much about menswear; they&rsquo;re just too bold, and make you look like you got your outfit from a very cheap rental place. </p>

<h3>Light Blue Dress Shirt</h3>



<p>Turning back to smarter options, the next biggest staple after white is light blue. Light blue shirts can be combined with any kind of gray suit, but look particularly nice with medium and lighter grey suits. Of course, light blue comes in maybe 200 different shades, and there are many <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="patterns and textures (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/matching-colors-textures-men-fall/" target="_blank">patterns and textures</a>. Simply pick one that you like and that provides a contrast to your suit. If you wear a light blue shirt with a medium or light grey suit, we suggest you go with barrel cuffs instead of French cuffs and maybe a slightly more casual collar, but try to forgo the chest pocket for a more streamlined appearance. It looks nice overall because it&rsquo;s a bit more casual, and therefore the whole outfit flows together. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.29.38-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.29.38-PM-1030x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-115951" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.29.38-PM-1030x579.png 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.29.38-PM-450x253.png 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.29.38-PM-768x432.png 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.29.38-PM-1500x844.png 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.29.38-PM-705x397.png 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>A denim shirt can be a good option for casual grey ensembles</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The sole exception to our advice about darker shirts above is that wearing a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="denim shirt (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-denim-shirt/" target="_blank">denim shirt</a> with a less formal grey suit can work. These have been quite popular lately, and can add a bit of interest to an outfit because of the slight color variance provided by the wash.&nbsp;Overall, though, we would suggest that you try to wear a shirt that is lighter in color than your suit, as this is the color balance that&rsquo;s most natural and complementary to the eye.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of ties, a solid navy tie is of course a formal staple when paired with a blue shirt and a gray suit&ndash;but it can be also a little boring. Other than the usual suspects of red, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="green (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-green/" target="_blank">green</a>, or plum, you could also experiment with the complementary color to blue, which is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="orange (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-pair-orange/" target="_blank">orange</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Charcoal-Gray-Suit-Pink-Shirt-1030x574.jpg" alt="A pink shirt pairs especially well with a charcoal gray suit." class="wp-image-116025" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Charcoal-Gray-Suit-Pink-Shirt-1030x574.jpg 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Charcoal-Gray-Suit-Pink-Shirt-450x251.jpg 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Charcoal-Gray-Suit-Pink-Shirt-768x428.jpg 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Charcoal-Gray-Suit-Pink-Shirt-1500x836.jpg 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Charcoal-Gray-Suit-Pink-Shirt-705x393.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"><figcaption>A pink shirt pairs especially well with a charcoal gray suit.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Pink Dress Shirts</h3>



<p>Pastel pinks can be a great change to the monotony of white and light blue shirts, and they work particularly well with gray. This is because there&rsquo;s a subtle contrast, yet the pink works to warm up the gray color. Probably for that reason, pairing charcoal suits with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="pink (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-pink-menswear/" target="_blank">pink</a> shirts was a favorite look of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Fred Astaire (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fred-astaire-gentleman-of-style/" target="_blank">Fred Astaire</a>, who was always very well-dressed. Adding a navy tie, or one in purple (violet) to your pink shirt and your gray suit will create an interesting combination that is still harmonious. Of course, a burgundy tie would work too, but we&rsquo;d recommend that you usually stay clear of a brighter red, since it will likely be too much next to the pink background. </p>



<h3>Pastel-Colored Dress Shirts</h3>



<p>Following the staples of white, blue, and pink dress shirts, basically, any other type of pastel color can work really well with a grey suit. It could be something like a light green, maybe a light <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="yellow (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-yellow-menswear/" target="_blank">yellow</a>, or a pastel orange.&nbsp;If you opt to wear a colored shirt, a safe choice is always to wear a tie in a darker shade from the same color family. So if I have a light orange or creamy shirt then maybe an orange tie would work. If there is some green in my shirt, a green tie works.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.35.10-PM.png"><img src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.35.10-PM-1030x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-115956" srcset="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.35.10-PM-1030x579.png 1030w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.35.10-PM-450x253.png 450w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.35.10-PM-768x432.png 768w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.35.10-PM-1500x844.png 1500w, https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-16-at-2.35.10-PM-705x397.png 705w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"></a><figcaption>A textured tie in burnt orange is a natural complement to a white shirt with orange stripes.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Patterned Dress Shirts</h3>



<p>This brings us to our next point: shirts don&rsquo;t have to be solids. You can have patterned shirts as well, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="stripes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/stripes-menswear-different-types/" target="_blank">stripes</a> are the most classic ones. Keep in mind that larger stripes are more casual, and therefore better suited to lighter shades of gray. Of course, you can also incorporate <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="checked (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/grids-plaids-windowpanes/" target="_blank">checked</a> shirts into your outfits&ndash;they&rsquo;re a bit more casual than striped ones so they work better with light grey suits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, shirts with smaller and more traditional patterns such as stripes or checks will work better with gray suits than very bold <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="flowery prints (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-florals/" target="_blank">flowery prints</a>. If you want to pair a patterned gray suit with a patterned shirt and a patterned tie, you can maybe pull it off; just make sure that the relative &ldquo;densities&rdquo; or spacings of the patterns are all different. Your suit, for example, could feature a pinpoint or something that&rsquo;s very close to a solid, your shirt could be striped, and your tie could feature a micropattern. In this case, everything would be harmonious and not just the same width and scale. Disregarding these theories on pattern density will likely end up looking confusing to the viewer.</p>



<h2>The Importance Of Textures</h2>



<p>A solid silk tie is more formal than a knitted tie in the exact same color. Let&rsquo;s say you have a gray suit with a striped shirt&ndash;rather than getting a plain solid tie, we&rsquo;d suggest going with a <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/all-about-grenadine/">grenadine tie</a>, or maybe a knit tie If you want to have even more texture. </p>

<p>In general, the lighter the shade of gray is for your suit, the more texture you can add. At the same time, if you have a charcoal flannel suit which is quite dark, a knitted tie can still work well, because they&rsquo;re both somewhat casual in texture and so it&rsquo;s a harmonious look.&nbsp;At the end of the day, pretty much any shirt or tie color can work with a gray suit as long as you understand basic <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-use-the-color-wheel-to-assemble-superior-outfits/">color theory</a>.</p>
