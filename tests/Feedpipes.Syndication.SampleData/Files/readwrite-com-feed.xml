Blockchain is one such technology. Blockchain has started to make inroads into many business sectors. Blockchain will bring only thoughts of cryptocurrencies to many people. dApp development will help the healthcare industry.</p>
<p>However, technology has invaded industries as varied as healthcare and transportation. The dApp is one product that uses blockchain technology. These are applications or programs that run without centralized control. A central entity controls all applications. Blockchain technology is what facilitates the creation of dApps, so why does healthcare need blockchain technology?</p>
<h2>What is blockchain technology?</h2>
<p>It is not a technology that is used only in <a href="https://readwrite.com/2018/11/02/how-can-cryptocurrency-change-retail-payments/"><strong><u><b>cryptocurrency transactions</b></u></strong></a>. The Blockchain is an open-source technology. In this technology, transactions get recorded on a decentralized ledger. Transactions get spread across the chain. There are no centralized agencies which control the operations. This technology cuts out the need for a middle man. Alternatively, it uses consensus from all involved parties to validate a transaction.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible for someone to make a transaction without the other entities knowing about it. It allows total transparency of all transactions. Though initially, people use this technology for transactions of cryptocurrencies, many industries are looking at ways to adopt this technology. There are many advantages of using this technology, especially where there is an exchange of data between many people.</p>
<h3>Advantages of blockchain technology.</h3>
<p>Before we see how Blockchain helps the healthcare industry, we should look at the benefits of using this technology. Any technology may get used if it adds value to the existing system. Let us see how blockchain technology is beneficial. The first and most significant advantage of Blockchain is that there is no central authority to validate transactions. Every transaction gets distributed to all the members of a chain.</p>
<p>Hence there is no way any tampering can happen. The fact that every transaction gets accepted by consensus will prevent any fraud. Every transaction is recorded and validated by everyone. It means that there is total transparency in the system. It improves trust in the system. Every member of the group can see the details of every transaction. In earlier systems, the data was stored in a centralized location.</p>
<p>In Blockchain, it gets spread among the various servers in the system. It makes it almost impossible for anyone to enter the system and steal the data. There is no central data store for hackers to target. As there is no central agency checking or approving each transaction, the cost of transactions become much less. It results in a considerable saving of money. The system itself takes care of the job. It also saves time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Blockchain is a system that checks and approves the transactions</li>
<li>As there is no single agency supporting the transactions, there is no way tampering can take place. All purchases need the consensus of all members.</li>
<li>There is total transparency and trust because everyone can see all the transactions.</li>
<li>There is more trust as everything is out in the open for everyone to see</li>
<li>There is no centralized data storage for hackers to target.</li>
<li>Money and time savings as there is no need to wait for someone to approve the transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What ails the healthcare industry?</h3>
<p>Before we see how Blockchain can play an essential role in the healthcare industry, we must look at the problems that the healthcare industry faces. There are many issues concerning sharing of medical information, treatment of patients, and distribution of medicines which can use the blockchain technology. One of the primary reasons for the theft of data from EMR (electronic medical records) of patients is that they are all stored in a centralized location.</p>
<p>It makes it easy for any hacker to access the data and use it for illegal purposes. Another problem with the medical record of patients is the delay in getting the data. The patient may have undergone treatment in one facility. If another health organization wants these data, they have to wait to get it. It may take longer if these facilities are located in locations far apart.</p>
<p>There is always difficulty in compiling the medical details from various sources. It may be possible to integrate the medical records from wearable devices of a patient with other data. But it certainly is not easy. Today more and more people are using wearable devices to record body activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theft of EMR is rampant as data gets stored in one location</li>
<li>Hackers need only to open one storage device to get access to all data. These hackers sell these medical data for money.</li>
<li>Sending data from one health organization to another can take a lot of time.</li>
<li>Compiling of medical records from different sources is difficult.</li>
<li>Integration of data from wearable devices with other medical records is a lengthy process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Blockchain in the healthcare industry.</h3>
<p>While Blockchain will help solve the above problems, it also finds a use for many purposes in the healthcare industry. Let us first see how Blockchain helps to solve the above issues. The first advantage of Blockchain is that it is fully decentralized. The system does not store any data in centralized storage devices. The data is available in a distributed manner across the whole network. There is no way hackers can target one source and get all the information.</p>
<p>When the data gets distributed across the whole chain, it is easy to access the data. The patient can own the data and decide who has access to the data. It means that when the patient goes to a different healthy facility, even in a different country, he or she can show the data to the new doctor. There is no time delay or the need to wait for someone to share the data.</p>
<p>Blockchain helps to merge the data from wearables to be integrated with other medical records available. Users will generate IoT data which they can consolidate with other healthcare organization data. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/06/17/how-can-blockchain-help-secure-iot-data/"><strong><u><b>Blockchain can help to secure IoT data</b></u></strong></a> with the utmost ease. Apart from the above, the main advantage is the formation of dApp, which are very helpful in the healthcare industry. Let us see how dApp can play a significant role in the industry. Before that, we need to look at what is a dApp.</p>
<h3><strong><b>What are dApps?</b></strong></h3>
<p>dApp stands for Decentralized Application. It is a web application meant for sharing of information between the users. Unlike other apps, there is no central ownership or managing body. All the users of the app maintain the app. Any new addition or change is made through mutual consent. A copy of the app gets stored in the computers of all the users. It doesn&#8217;t matter how many people are there in the network.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is probably the first dApp which runs on the Blockchain. It is a dApp for financial transactions. There is no central financial institution controlling the transactions. Each person adds an entry to the ledger.</p>
<h3>Healthcare and dApps.</h3>
<p>Apart from helping in financial transactions, dApps have been useful in many other industries. But healthcare is an industry which can get a lot of help from this technology. Let us see how the healthcare industry can use dApps.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dapps-in-hospitalbenifits.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-155389 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dapps-in-hospitalbenifits.jpg" alt="Benefits of using dApps in Healthcare" width="835" height="1424" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dapps-in-hospitalbenifits.jpg 835w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dapps-in-hospitalbenifits-94x160.jpg 94w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dapps-in-hospitalbenifits-176x300.jpg 176w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dapps-in-hospitalbenifits-422x719.jpg 422w" sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px" /></a></p>
<h3>Sharing of data.</h3>
<p>It is probably the best use for dApps in the healthcare industry. When a patient is undergoing treatment, the details get entered in the app. dApps can connect the pieces of information in a shared network. It means that the treatment detail will be available at any time if the patient is visiting another hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that such exchanges can help in patients getting better treatment. Sometimes patients of similar symptoms can be treated with different medication. If the data is updated, doctors can know which treatment was more beneficial and start using that medication.</p>
<h3>Secure data storage.</h3>
<p>It is another important use of dApps in the healthcare industry. The dApp can store the data and spread it across all members of the group. It means that there is no central storage server which hackers can target.</p>
<p>Hospitals store a considerable amount of data on secure servers. However, these are all vulnerable to attacks by hackers who will steal the personal data of patients. Having the data spread across an app will frustrate the hackers as there will be no target for them.</p>
<h3>Public Health.</h3>
<p>If there is a dApp which gets shared between various health practitioners and organizations, they can share information about an epidemic. It will help in treating the epidemic faster. Everyone in the network can add their knowledge about different treatment methods. It is right in the case of research too. If the research details get shared in a dApp, this can help different researchers involved in similar studies. They will know the results of various trails which have been conducted by their colleagues.</p>
<p>An important fact here is that all the users in the dApp verify every entry. There is no way to make a wrong entry can. Nobody can claim ownership wrongly as every entry has to be authenticated by mutual consent. The study is safe, and everyone who has contributed will get his or her credit.</p>
<h3>Patient Health data.</h3>
<p>Instead of storing the health details of patients in a centralized electronic health record, they can store in a dApp which is owned and controlled by them. They can decide who can view the app. Patients cannot access EHR now. In a dApp, the patients can integrate their medical details from wearable devices. They can also use other tools and include that data in the medical records. It will help the doctors to give a complete picture of the patients&#8217; health.</p>
<h3>Agreements and contracts.</h3>
<p>It is a very time-consuming process getting the family members to sign the deal when someone has to undergo surgery. There are forms to be completed and signature affixed. These have to be sent to a centralized authority for approval. In the case of a dApp, the patients&#8217; relatives and the hospital can manage this without any central authority. It is possible because the others in the group authenticate every entry. It saves a lot of time.</p>
<h3>A secure on-demand model.</h3>
<p>The on-demand service app has made its presence felt in the healthcare industry. There are apps which help in the supply of medicines. There are also apps which help you get a doctor when you want. But there was no secure app for this purpose. dApps are the solution. They can help in a very secure network of doctors and medical suppliers. If there is a problem, it is straightforward to find out where it has happened and correct it.</p>
<p><strong>As all the users of the app have to authenticate, any data entered is immediately known to all the people concerned.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doctors treating patients who got treatment elsewhere can have instant access to patient&#8217;s records.</li>
<li>Doctors can arrive at the best cure for a condition as treatment methods for similar symptoms are shared.</li>
<li>Patient data is very secure as there is no central storage server for hackers to target.</li>
<li>Epidemics can be treated quickly as information about treatment is readily available on the dApp.</li>
<li>Researches researching similar diseases can share information and have access to details about various trials and results.</li>
<li>Researchers are safe when sharing information as every entry needs authentication. Nobody can make the wrong claims.</li>
<li>Patients can integrate all medical records in a dApp which they have access and can control. It is better than EHR.</li>
<li>You can integrate medical results from <a href="https://readwrite.com/2013/02/04/wearable-devices-next-design-challenge-the-human-brain/"><strong><u><b>wearable devices</b></u></strong></a> and other sources in one dApp.</li>
<li>The signing of agreements and contracts are fast and secure.</li>
<li>On-demand services become safer as mistakes can be immediately located and corrected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Obstacles and Difficulties in Using Blockchain Technology.</h2>
<p>Different regions have different medical guidelines. In a blockchain network, nobody knows whether everyone is following the directions correctly. It is because there is no central authority controlling the information. Another difficulty that occurs when storing medical data is storage capacity. Each user generates a considerable amount of data. It is much more than what can get stored in a blockchain because of the size restrictions of the block.</p>
<p>The time taken for data to be loaded on to the Blockchain is another matter. The process is prolonged. It is because of the number of consents that are required before it can get recorded. There is a need to find a better system than the proof-of-work method. Data cannot be changed once it gets entered in the Blockchain. It adds to the security of the data because no one can change it. But this also makes it impossible to scale the data.</p>
<h3><strong><b>Conclusion</b></strong></h3>
<p>The technology is still in its nascent state. There are many difficulties in using blockchain technology in the healthcare industries. There are unclear areas concerning data privacy. There is doubt about who should get access and who shouldn&#8217;t. The cost of technology is another obstacle to using it very widely. The main problem, however, would be to convince the various parties to adopt the technology and prove that it is useful and safer than present systems.</p>
<p>The fact that it keeps patients&#8217; data safe and gives them control should be enough reason to push forward this technology.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there will likely be advantages to be had by running a business as a freelancer or solopreneur, the chances are that there are also several disadvantages that probably outweigh these advantages. On the other hand, although there are numerous advantages to registering your business as a legal entity, the question usually is, exactly what type of legal entity or business structure is best for your business? The best answer that often applies to most situations is; it depends. However, this article aims to make an argument as to why a solopreneur should consider </span><a href="https://smallbusinessattorneynyc.com/creating-an-llc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as opposed to other business structures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there are other types of business structures such as Partnerships and Corporations, and these might be more suitable for certain types of businesses. For example, a solopreneur would have to take on one or more partners or members in order to successfully register a business as a partnership, and while a single-member owned business can register as a corporation, one advice usually given by business lawyers is that certain ‘non-mandatory’ conditions be met before this route is taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, it is essential to know exactly what creating an LLC entails, what it can mean for your business and why you should consider forming one.</span></p>
<p><b>Understanding the Fundamentals of an LLC</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While LLCs have been around for some time, they have not particularly been a popular business structure for small business owners, until quite recently. There are specific requirements necessary to register (and maintain) a corporation, and most small businesses find these requirements quite burdensome. An LLC provides the </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/77966"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same type of protection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you would receive under a corporation, but without the burdensome regulations and formalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, an LLC should be created with two members or more. But, if you are a solopreneur, you can register a Single-Member LLC (SMLLC.) Creating a single-member LLC is easy to set up and run and provides the same sort of flexibility you get as a Sole Proprietor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, if you are looking for an uncomplicated and straightforward way to register your business in a way that protects your personal assets, then an LLC is the best option, and we’ll share our reasons in this article.</span></p>
<h2><b>A Few Reasons to Consider Forming an LLC Include:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Limited Liability Protection</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main benefits of registering an LLC is the limited liability protection. Typically, if you run a Sole Proprietorship, then your personal assets are usually not protected from any debt obligation that the company might incur. The implication of this becomes more real if there is a lawsuit against your business, which you lose. The absence of a limitation of liability means that in the event of a lawsuit against your business, you could lose your personal property if you lose the case. With an LLC, only your business assets are liable in a lawsuit against the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, an LLC provides a limitation of your liability so that your personal assets are protected from such debts and lawsuits.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tax Flexibility</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably one of the reasons why entrepreneurs shy away from registering their businesses is the misconception about double taxation. However, when you register your business as an LLC, you won’t have to deal with this problem. With an LLC, taxation is simple and flexible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For taxation purposes, single-member LLCs are </span><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/structuring/the-single-member-llc-an-ideal-choice-for-solopreneurs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">treated as “disregarded entities”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means that you will not need to file separate tax forms for your business. You will instead be filing your business profits and losses on Form 1040, which is the form that citizens and residents of the U.S. use to file their individual tax returns. This situation is what is referred to as a “pass-through” taxation, wherein the profits and losses of the businesses are passed through to the individual, who files these on their individual tax return, thereby eliminating double taxation.</span></p>
<h3><b>Compliance Requirements</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compliance requirements are an essential point that makes forming an LLC worth considering. A limitation of liability is generally assumed to a corporation or an LLC, however, this can be stripped for several reasons one of which is a failure to comply with required regulations. Knowing all the laws is where a corporation can become cumbersome because there are so many ongoing regulations. It is also what makes an LLC such a good idea because you get the benefit of liability protection without so many formalities attached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the requirements vary across states, so it is a good idea to speak to a </span><a href="https://dallasbusinesslitigationattorney.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good business lawyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you navigate through the specific requirements and conditions that may apply to the type of business you want to register.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Fictitious Name Problem</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, a solopreneur might decide to operate using a different name. For instance, John F. Samson might own a cleaning service, and he decides to run it using the name, ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply Divine Cleaning Services.’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing wrong with that; however, if another business chooses to register the same name, there is nothing to stop them from using it to carry out their business. Even worse is a situation where they end up <a href="https://readwrite.com/2018/08/30/trademark-protection-for-startups/" rel="noopener noreferrer">trademarking</a> that business or product name, which happens to be the same name you use for your &#8216;fictitious&#8217; company, or Doing Business As (DBA) name. You would automatically need to cease using that name, otherwise, face the threat of legal action if they find out. Creating an LLC and registering a specific company name ensures that your business name is reserved and that no one else can use it in or for their business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Credibility</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, having the LLC designator at the end of your business’s name <a href="https://readwrite.com/2010/03/16/founding-startup-credibility-your-best-friend/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lends credibility</a> to your business. It not only shows your customers that your business is registered with the state, but it is also an indicator that your business is there for the long haul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, while nothing prevents a solopreneur from doing business without registering a formal business entity with the state, there are drawbacks to this business structure.

The company with offices in New York, Amsterdam, and London aims to digitally transform volume recruiting into an enjoyable process for recruiters, hiring managers and candidates alike. For more information on Harver, visit <a href="https://harver.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Through a combination of scientifically validated assessments and customized situational judgment tests, companies can make data-driven hiring decisions and mitigate against unconscious bias.</p>
<p>Recruiters and hiring managers see how the candidates’ skills and characteristics match the role and the company, rather than having to make assumptions based on their background or previous experience. With Harver, organizations can focus on assessing characteristics that are truly predictive for success on the job.</p>
<p>Harver is helping clients like KPMG, Zappo, and Booking, to manage large volumes of applicants and at the same time, provide an engaging candidate experience.</p>
<p>Besides applying on mobile, Harver also allows candidates to self-schedule interviews and receive updates on their application process. As a result, recruiters and hiring managers save hours on pre-screening, leaving them with more time for other, arguably more important tasks.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In a reality where technology takes care of all the tedious work while removing biases, recruiters can do what they love to do: build a true connection between the applicants and the organization. Harver will provide this reality,” says Barend Raaff, CEO at Harver.</p></blockquote>
<p>By automating parts of their recruitment process, organizations can significantly decrease the time spent on filling their vacancies. One of the largest European supermarket chains, Albert Heijn, reduced their time to hire by 40 percent after implementing Harver.</p>
<p>The company is planning to use the recent investment to further expand its product. The investment will help more companies digitally transform their recruitment process, empowering recruiters and hiring managers to make fast and data-driven hiring decisions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have been at the forefront of recruitment innovation since the inception of our company. This investment will enable us to take another leap forward in eliminating bias from the recruitment process and create a level playing field for all job seekers,” concludes Raaff.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="300" height="160" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/how-to-protect-your-medical-data-300x160.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="how to protect your medical data" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/how-to-protect-your-medical-data-300x160.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/how-to-protect-your-medical-data-260x138.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/how-to-protect-your-medical-data.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div><p>Cybercrime is on the rise, and healthcare is becoming a primary target as per recent news. What is accounted as cybercrime at a medical practice? Anything from a hacker stealing protected health information for medical identity theft to a staff member viewing patient records without prior authorization. You&#8217;ll need healthcare cybersecurity tips to help protect your data.</p>
<h2>It was becoming increasingly challenging to protect PHI, (protected health information &#8212; PHI is under the HIPAA laws).</h2>
<p>Hackers are displaying ingenuity with every data breach and often a time the practice staff turns out to be the root cause. Either they weren’t careful or willingly allowed someone to access practice data. To curb cybercrime and other security threats to the centralized database, there are nationwide legislations like <a href="https://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/HITECH-Act">HITECH</a> (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).</p>
<p>These acts (laws) promote the efficient implementation of technology for caregivers. The primary focus of these acts is the security and privacy of EHRs. The severity of the crime determines the fine you pay. If someone has unknowingly broken the law, they pay a low fine and also have a month to rectify the offense in which case no penalty is taken from them.</p>
<p>Other laws like the False Claims Act and perpetrators of the Stark Law (patient referrals to friends and family, except in exceptional circumstances) also deal with impersonators who steal identities for insurance claims. Any data breach has consequences. It can cost a practice hefty fines under HIPAA and HITECH, but more importantly, it puts a practice’s or hospital’s reputation at stake.</p>
<p>Patients also need to know their privacy is protected, and it will cost practice patients if there is a data breach. Since the patient’s records, audits, and doctor’s information are stored in a centralized database, a small breach can have significant consequences. Similarly, there are a lot of encrypted security standards that make an EHR secure.</p>
<p>If a vendor does not comply with industry standards, it is best to switch to a more secure <a href="https://blog.curemd.com/ehr-and-billing/">EHR and Billing</a> Provider. Patients and practice continuity are both vulnerable if precautions and necessary steps are not taken to protect data by practitioners. Leave no stone unturned for your own protection and reputation.</p>
<p>Here’s what can be done by a certain practice to avoid lawsuit/security breach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Taking Responsibility &gt; Change Passwords Repeatedly:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that the medical practice should change their passwords intermittently. It may also help to keep a different password to access various applications. However, it is cumbersome to remember different passwords; it would be wise to subscribe to a secure password manager app or use devices and applications with single sign-on capabilities.</p>
<p>It is essential to have secure passwords to access online records. Practice managers and even staff computers should have hard-to-crack passwords. Your work devices can have details about patients’ histories, prescription, and medical billing. Health IT professionals have recommended it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Controlled Accessibility and Audit Logs</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Role-Based Accessibility: An advised tactic is for all practice managers, physicians, and influential persons in the practice should have their own passwords and usernames to access EHRs and other electronic devices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First:</strong> everyone will only be able to see information relevant to them.</li>
<li><strong>Second</strong>: it will reduce the times a staff member is likely to share a password. Residents use their co-worker&#8217;s passwords around four times as per research cited by Kevin McCarthy on his blog “The Importance of Password Security in Your Medical Practice.”</li>
<li><strong>Another way: </strong>to reduce password-sharing is to use audit logs on all EHR devices. Logs make it very easy to track edits, reviews, and views by all users. It can also be used to track tasks, and time spent working on the system for added measure.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking time:</strong> and date spent on a certain system will increase employee efficiency, and ensure practice productivity. All medical devices, including mHealth, should use encryption.</li>
<li>
<h3>Staff Training and Education:</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes<a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/04/30/how-to-create-an-effective-cybersecurity-routine/"> staff can misuse work computers</a> or other devices without knowledge. Misuse happens when they surf the web and accidentally click on a link that becomes the gateway. Negligence is one of the most common causes of security breaches. However, with repeated user training, and this can be curbed.</p>
<p>To further instill employee vigilance, higher management must score staff on security, which should have an impact on yearly evaluations. These evaluations will make them aware of their work habits, and also keep an eye out for an unauthorized user who wants access to data.</p>
<p>Teach all staff members not to leave any identifying information should never be left in the open; whether it is on a post-it, or on a screen. Any visual would include a family name, first name, an address, and contact details. Though this information itself is not sufficient to hack or invade private data, it is a small outlet of information that may be used against the practice.</p>
<p>Consistent staff training will enable vigilance in the practice, and keep all information out of reach of every visitor. Patients, lab staff, cleaners, pharmaceutical reps, come and go, and their whereabouts are not always monitored. The staff enables the smooth running of a practice, and are likely to ensure that all security protocols are in place.</p>
<p>Your staff is also the most authentic sources when it comes to reporting activities and day-to-day operations. It is best to invest in their training and educating them about security breaches so they can take care of the practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Accessibility Restrictions</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure security, network restrictions should be enforced along with limited web browsing. The use of restrictions is highly recommended for all workplaces that house sensitive information. This reduces malpractice and keeps staff focused on their jobs. A practice must restrict usage and bring of personal devices which transmit data to strengthen security further.</p>
<p>Staff might feel disconnected from social media at work and be tempted to use social media platforms. However, using social media increases the probability of clicking on the unknown link, or general personal browsing can invite a virus attack and potential hacking.</p>
<p>The moment you give an app or web browser access to your computer, you are putting the device at risk. Restricting these activities, and only allowing approved applications such as your PM software, EHR, and billing and accounting software. Ensure practice policies are followed through accountability.</p>
<p>Restricting unknown websites or entertainment pages are going to make your online systems more secure. Staff should be allowed to use these on their mobile phones in breaks. USBs are known to facilitate data theft. Make sure no unknown device is connected to any system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Cloud Technology is Your Friend</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud technology maintains a backup of all your practice data and applications. Cloud services give full security to practices of all sizes. It can be backed up daily or weekly. Regular updates ensure that your data will be kept safe even if there is a security breach or if your device breakdowns.</p>
<p>Some practice managers keep all data safe and secure on a USB drive, which is then kept in a safe off-site. While that is practical, cloud servers also allow for all updated data to be kept safe and off-site. It is not only on your system but also stored in another encrypted storage space.</p>
<p>The only drawback of cloud computing is that your information is also stored in a system out of reach. Vetting the security of cloud computing becomes incumbent. Update all data with cloud. Many modern healthcare management systems now include archival data solutions, with updated records stored in the cloud. Get more advice about features like these by either talking to a consultant, or an IT professional within the practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Update and Delete</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have secured your data, and it is safe, don’t hesitate to delete old data. Make sure this is backed up before removing it because it can come in handy as well. Keeping all medical devices up to date and patched will minimize vulnerabilities. Try not to use outdated browsers and other software.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer is found on many devices even though Microsoft does not authorize it. Upgrade those devices that do not allow for the latest updates. Do not throw out old devices if they are not devoid of information even if data encryption is in place. Safely dispose of all medical devices.</p>
<p>Remove, disable, and <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/18/how-ai-helps-secure-your-finances-and-other-stuff-on-mobile/">disconnect unnecessary accounts</a>, or accounts no longer in use, so former employees, staff members, and other personnel cannot misuse their accounts. Get rid of unnecessary software and browsers that are no longer needed. PDF converters, readers, and search engines that require additional downloads are most likely to infiltrate your system with viruses and malware.</p>
<p>Plan ahead when you are updating, deleting, and upgrading systems. Upgrades (hardware and software) cost money, and practice needs to see the most viable options keeping security as the acme. Restore back-ups when required and only update data which is necessary. Restoring a backup will reduce the time taken for a system to update and restore backed up data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Get a Proficient Security Provider</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Small practices can perform risk analysis with more ease than an extensive practice while being cost-effective. Enhancing cybersecurity prevents data loss, and oversees the<a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/05/19/what-to-expect-from-a-modern-iot-platform-in-2019/"> safe-keeping</a> of the whole practice and not just the EHR system. Identifying gaps, addressing vulnerabilities, viruses, and malware are mitigated with regular checks reducing disruptions in practice management. Do not turn off any software updates.</p>
<p>Install any firewall software to secure practice network. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/05/24/the-key-to-improving-global-cybersecurity-is-data-science/">Securing the network is the easiest way</a> to waive internal and external threats. The better the firewall, the safer the data. Upgrade to a recent security wall, preferably one with the manufacturer or commercial-grade updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Hire a Professional</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology can be daunting and cumbersome. If a practice can afford a security consultant who can train staff as well, that’s fortunate. If not, hire someone who has specialized IT skills who can take charge of the practice’s security. Give your new practice employee the task to oversee government-regulated compliance documents.</p>
<p>The research industry trends and ensures operating systems updates. If they can do all this, they can surely ensure all medical devices are also patched and address potential threats to the practice’s security. Make sure they know how to encrypt all data and can follow encryption procedures with ease.</p>
<p>Hiring a data security expert can give annual updates on how the practice is secure, and oversee security threat and HIPAA compliance. If a practice complies with all regulations enforced by their state, the data is very secure. However, as a precaution, it is safer if the practice also takes matters in their own hands.</p>
<p>Periodical risk assessments, engaging with changing government laws and regulations, and regular practice audits are also necessary for encumbering security breaches/threats.</p>
<p>Medical practices and healthcare organizations are easy targets for knowing the demographics, finances, and other sensitive information. Cybercriminals and white-collar criminals target healthcare organizations and practices knowing that there is an easier target.</p>
<p>It is pivotal for a practice to ensure that they are protected against growing threats or vulnerabilities in their system. Therefore it is in the best interest of doctors, nurses, and other stakeholders to ensure multilayered and complex security that is hard to violate easily.</p>
<p>It is against the law for patient data to be stored unencrypted. Industry-standard encryption codes are employed; such as HL7, ICD10, LOINC, CPT4, ANSIX12. These ensure secure interoperability and keep the patients’ data private and secure. Health data is susceptible to risk.</p>
<p>It is also quite challenging to protect health data because of its demands. Governments have made it mandatory to ensure HIPAA and HL7 compliance, but that is not all. A practice needs to take responsibility for data protection. There are guidelines on how practices can protect their data, and strict measures like hefty fines and security requirements have been placed as a regulatory system for all to follow. <a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"></a></p>

<p>To better understand AI consider social media platforms. Even a child can learn to use social with ease. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/03/27/future-of-artificial-intelligence-for-2020/">Artificial Intelligence</a> is something that works and presents you with content that draws and drags the sites sleekness and attention. The AI algorithm does its best job by offering the user with the posts and experiences based on the user&#8217;s interest &#8211;all by allowing AI to be working in the background</p>
<h3><strong>Put your AI and UX together and see how it all works.<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence is something which lets machines know and speculate and zero-in on the interests of a person. As a result, it offers user-oriented choices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suppose there is one operation you do for your company office daily by yourself. You first think of automation, and that is fast and effective. Using the AI algorithms in your office, you will still be able to automate &#8212; but now, if you have optimized your UX, your AI will keep the website filled with the details and logic to work in the best interest of your site visitors. AI will make the overall experience of your site visitor &#8212; a customer-specific action.</p>
<h2><strong>Look how AI is impacting UX.</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>#1 &#8211; A person to person &#8220;feeling&#8221; happens to online chats.<br />
</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Real-Human-Like-Experience-When-It-Happens-To-Online-Chatting.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-155471" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Real-Human-Like-Experience-When-It-Happens-To-Online-Chatting-900x506.jpg" alt="With AI, a better person to person &quot;feeling&quot; happens to online chats." width="750" height="422" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Real-Human-Like-Experience-When-It-Happens-To-Online-Chatting-900x506.jpg 900w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Real-Human-Like-Experience-When-It-Happens-To-Online-Chatting-260x146.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Real-Human-Like-Experience-When-It-Happens-To-Online-Chatting-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Real-Human-Like-Experience-When-It-Happens-To-Online-Chatting.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>The feature of live-chatting on the website seems to make everything much more straightforward for its site visitors. By integrating the AI system to your website, <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/05/21/prodigious-customer-service-live-chat-vs-chatbots/">chatbots</a> are going to work for you. The AI-enabled chatbots ensure that your customer is experiencing user-centric experiences while visiting your site.</p>
<h3><strong>#2 &#8211; Enhanced and refined user experience.</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enhanced-and-Refined-User-Experience.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-155468 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enhanced-and-Refined-User-Experience.jpg" alt="Enhanced and refined user experience with AI and UX working together." width="750" height="420" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enhanced-and-Refined-User-Experience.jpg 750w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enhanced-and-Refined-User-Experience-260x146.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enhanced-and-Refined-User-Experience-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to knowing the varied needs and demands of the user, AI can work wonders. This algorithm is wholly meant to collect the data and activities of the user. AI will then offer effective and user-centric experience to the user. AI and UX design work together in an attractive and catchy format that enhances the user experience with machine learning.</p>
<p>AI is playing a huge and impactful role in the UX design space. AI is a huge leap forward for the UX developers wise enough to get these two tools working together. As AI tools continue to develop, UX designers will undoubtedly innovate with new approaches that leverage the benefits UX contributes.</p>

Software development is something you can learn, but <a href="https://readwrite.com/2008/07/22/top_10_concepts_that_every_software_engineer_should_know/">it takes years of experience</a> (and oftentimes a team of collaborators) to create a functional finished product—and most aspiring entrepreneurs don’t have the time or patience to go through these steps on their own.</p>
<p>However, merely hiring a custom software developer isn’t going to be enough to guarantee your product will be built the way you want it. There are hundreds, if not thousands of available options, and thousands of variables that could impact your project along the course of its development.</p>
<p>So what steps can you take to ensure your project is successful when hiring a custom software developer?</p>
<h3>Validating Your Idea</h3>
<p>Before doing anything else, take the time to think critically about your idea for an app or software project; you’ll need to focus on two main dimensions. First, consider whether your idea makes sense from a business and marketing standpoint. There are likely already versions of your idea that exist in the marketplace, or at least some ideas adjacent to it. How are these currently performing? Is your idea truly unique enough to stand on its own and differentiate itself from these?</p>
<p>Second, consider whether your software can be built from a logistical standpoint. This can be harder to determine. While hypothetically, software engineers can create anything, there are some logistical and functional limitations that could impact the feasibility of your idea.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to build an app that integrates with hundreds of third parties, or an app that needs <a href="https://readwrite.com/2007/10/16/the_future_of_software_development/">AI more powerful than anything else on the market</a>, you should be prepared for significant cost and time obstacles to build the app the way you envision it. Consider sharing your idea with a programmer or software engineer you trust to get a high-level assessment of your project’s feasibility.</p>
<p>During this stage, you may need to revisit and tweak your idea before you move on.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Custom Software Developer</h3>
<p>Once you’ve established that your software idea is buildable and marketable from a business perspective, you can move onto finding the right custom software developer. Don’t think of this as choosing a vendor, the way you’d choose a store to buy a specific product. Instead, think of it as choosing a partner.</p>
<p>In the words of <a href="https://www.simform.com/">Simform’s</a> Maitrik Kataria, “Your custom software developer will be working with you from start to finish, so it’s important to choose a company that’s not just competent, but also communicative and easy to get along with.”</p>
<p>You’ll need to consider many different factors when making this decision, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Area of expertise. </strong>Different software developers have different areas of expertise. Some may specialize in apps with a specific type of functionality, and some will specialize in building apps using one specific programming language. If your software idea has technical limitations or necessary specifications to follow, you’ll want to choose someone who’s an expert in this area.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity. </strong>If you’re trying to finish your software project as quickly as possible, you won’t be able to choose a one-man operation that already has multiple projects in queue. The bigger the capacity of your custom developer, the faster and more efficiently your project will be completed.</li>
<li><strong>Proximity. </strong>You may prefer to have a custom developer based in your home country, or even one in your city. Outsourcing your development project to another country could save you some money, but you might have to deal with workers in a different time zone, or you may encounter a language barrier. Working local could allow you to meet with account reps in person, which many entrepreneurs value.</li>
<li><strong>Trustworthiness. </strong><a href="https://readwrite.com/2012/08/23/what-every-organization-needs-to-know-about-the-changing-face-of-software-development/">Software development is becoming increasingly accessible</a>, which means more teams and individuals are starting their own operations. But how can you be confident that these operations will do a good job, or deliver what you paid them to create? Trustworthiness can be hard to gauge, but it’s an important factor to consider. What are this organization’s credentials? What kind of reviews and testimonials has it gotten?</li>
<li><strong>Communication. </strong>As you start shopping your idea around to different software developers, consider the flow of communication. Is it easy to get in contact with a representative? Do they seem to understand what you’re saying easily? Do they articulate themselves effectively? If you have communication problems early on, it doesn’t bode well for the future of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Cost. </strong>Cost is often a byproduct of the factors listed above; a developer with glowing reviews, tons of expertise, and incredible communicative reliability is probably going to be more expensive than their competitors. You often get what you pay for in this regard. Still, you may consider shopping around if your first choice can’t complete the project at a rate that fits within your budget.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Articulating Your Idea </strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve decided on a custom software developer, you’ll likely need to be involved in some kind of kickoff meeting, where you’ll articulate the <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/05/30/importance-of-application-software/">full scope of your idea</a>. This is a make or break point for most projects. If you don’t explain your idea well, you could end up with a software product that looks very different than what you have in your mind.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it’s important to think of your software idea from as many angles as possible. Consider the high-level goals it’s trying to achieve. Visualize what it looks like to an end consumer. Imagine what the logical architecture must be to support this functionality. A good custom software developer will use questions to prompt you to provide the right information, but it’s still wise to have a plan for communication on your own.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to articulate your expectations for the project. How often do you want to receive updates? Who will you be communicating with?</p>
<p><strong>Managing Your Timeline</strong></p>
<p>At this time, you’ll also need to think about the timeline for your project. Do you have a soft deadline for the development of this application? If so, you’ll need to hash that out with the development team. Do you have a backup plan in case that deadline isn’t hit? What milestones will you need to achieve along the way to feel confident that this team is going to complete your app in plenty of time.</p>
<p>You can ensure the project adheres to the timeline by communicating effectively, providing all materials as they’re requested by the developers, and by avoiding the addition of new scope. Scope creep will almost always increase the length of time it takes to develop a project, as well as the total cost.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining Flexible </strong></p>
<p>Most projects don’t go exactly as expected throughout the entirety of their development trajectory. This is why so many custom software developers employ an <a href="https://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/agile-development-software/">agile development strategy</a>, leaving plenty of room for adjustment. It’s important for you, too, to remain flexible. If developers run into a technical challenge that none of you have foreseen, work with them to come up with an alternative solution. Prepare multiple, redundant backup plans in case your primary vision doesn’t pan out the way you thought.</p>
<p>Obviously, this doesn’t mean you should bend over backward to accommodate whatever your developer says is important, but it does mean you shouldn’t commit too hard to a singular vision of how this project should play out.</p>
<p>Most people who take the above steps end up with a custom software development project they’re proud of—and are satisfied with the process they experienced along the way. With the right mentality and the right expectations, you should be able to achieve all your software development goals, without spending too much time or money in the process.</p>

But not anymore. Today, you can be sitting at home, enjoy having a cup of freshly brewed coffee and work as a full-time employee for a company 7,814 miles away. And it’s not just about you or your team—this is happening all over the world right now.</p>
<p>A decade ago, most employers would have disregarded the idea of <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/04/05/the-modern-shape-and-trends-of-employee-culture/">remote culture</a>. But with today&#8217;s emerging tech, more and more businesses are hiring full-time remote employees and incorporating flexible work from home policies.</p>
<h4><b><i>Remote Work Trends &amp; Stats (2019) </i></b></h4>
<ul>
<li><i>55% of hiring managers agree that remote work among full-time employees is more common and expects up to 38% of their full-time employees to be working remotely in the next decade. </i></li>
<li><i>Two-third of managers who offer telecommunicating flexibility report that those who work from home are overall more productive. </i></li>
<li><i>More than 60% of job seekers who are millennials said an option to work remotely would greatly increase their interest in specific employers.</i></li>
<li><i>70% of employees work remotely at least one day a week, while 53% work remotely for at least half of the week.</i></li>
<li><i>39% of people who often work from home prefer to work additional hours to complete their tasks, compared with 24% of those in fixed workplaces.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like bed-in-a-box products themselves, the number of mattress brands consumers can choose from is <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/18/the-big-problem-with-sleep-related-technology/">expanding rapidly</a>. So how do established mattress companies stack up in the age of straight-to-your-door competition?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put that question to rest, two members of our team tested one of the traditional mattress sector’s flagship combinations: Tempur-Pedic’s </span><a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/shop-mattresses/tempur-breeze/v/3064/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TEMPUR-breeze°</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mattress paired with its </span><a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/bases-and-foundations/tempur-ergo/v/2556/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TEMPUR-Ergo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> power base.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157034" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Closeup-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Closeup-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Closeup-120x160.jpeg 120w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Closeup-539x719.jpeg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<h2><b>Meet Our Sleepers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because sleeping preferences are subjective, we started by surveying our testers. Who are they, and what’s their perfect sleeping environment?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first tester is a runner who prefers a firm sleeping surface. He sleeps best on his side (the significance of which we’ll cover below). Our second tester? She’s a former professional athlete who struggles to get to sleep after a series of sports-related injuries. Both testers are in their mid-thirties, and both prefer a cool room. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157035" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Firm-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Firm-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Firm-120x160.jpeg 120w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Firm-539x719.jpeg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did they discover? A whole lot more than a better night’s sleep.</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>What We Looked For</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it’s meant to help the sleeper stay cool, both testers were intrigued by the LUXEbreeze edition of the TEMPUR-breeze. According to Tempur-Pedic’s own testing, the LUXEbreeze “feels up to 8 degrees cooler based on average heat index… measured over 8 hours.” It does so with a series of layers that sap heat, allowing cool air to circulate beneath the sleeper. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157036" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Label-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Label-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Label-213x160.jpeg 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Label-900x675.jpeg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great mattress isn’t just cooling; it should be long-lasting, comfortable no matter the sleeper’s position, and priced appropriately. To support the sleeper &#8212; a mattress needs a high-quality base. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tempur-Pedic offers </span><a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/bases-and-foundations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three bases and three foundations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our testers wanted to see the latest in sleep technology attached to a top-quality frame. Tempur-Pedic says the TEMPUR-Ergo power base is “an essential part of a holistic sleep system.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ergo Extend base has many additional features for leg-height options. Personally, I really wish someone had tried out the <a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/bases-and-foundations/tempur-ergo-extend/v/2562/">TEMPUR-Ergo Extend.</a>  Reading about it right now &#8212; I&#8217;m thinking &#8220;this honey of a bed could maybe cure my restless-leg stuff.&#8221; Be that as it may, I sure stuff pillows under my legs, then feet, then the knees. This Ergo Extend looks like it takes care of all of that shifting of your legs &#8212; all night long &#8212; here and there for comfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ergo-Extend has soft-touch function keys so you can adjust in the dark &#8212; I looked that up quickly! Sitting all day at a desk, forgetting to stand, and having long legs &#8212; all a pain to deal with &#8212; all night long. It looks like there is help for not only your back &#8212; but your legs with this TEMPURPEDIC.com company.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the testers&#8217; needs in mind, we put them to work &#8212; and to bed. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Wake-Up Report</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After sleeping for a solid eight hours, both our testers reported that the TEMPUR-breeze° lived up to its claim of feeling cool. The difference is that the sleeper feels up to eight degrees cooler. Both noted that they tossed and turned less, allowing them to get to sleep sooner and stay asleep better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither tester needed to get up for a glass of water in the middle of the night, which both reported they often have to have a drink of water during the night. Possibly this drinking in the night is due to avoid dehydration? I found it curious that both testers would comment on the point about needing to drink water in the night, before sleeping on this system. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tempur-Pedic allowed both testers to <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/06/20/expert-tips-10-ways-to-sleep-soundly-at-night/">sleep</a> comfortably while lying on their backs throughout the night. That may sound unremarkable, but it’s a bit surprising given that </span><a href="https://www.sleep.org/articles/best-sleep-position/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of people sleep on their backs — and neither of our testers fall into this category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157037" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Zipper-277x300.jpeg" alt="" width="277" height="300" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Zipper-277x300.jpeg 277w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Zipper-148x160.jpeg 148w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Zipper-663x719.jpeg 663w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about durability? Although our test didn’t span the years needed to truly test this mattress attribute, our sleepers — as well as those online — had good things to say. One tester commented that the mattress maintains its shape well. Non-partisan review site </span><a href="https://www.sleeplikethedead.com/memory-foam-tempurpedic.html#2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep Like The Dead suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tempur-Pedic users keep their mattresses for about eight years &#8212; longer than similarly priced offerings from Sealy, Serta, and Simmons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of price, the TEMPUR-breeze does command a premium. Although both our testers pointed out its $4,499 price tag, they became significantly less concerned about it after sleeping on the mattress. Plus, Tempur-Pedic offers financing options: Those who can’t afford to pay upfront can split the cost into $93.73 per month across 48 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the premium price, our testers struggled to find fault with the TEMPUR-breeze. But, what about the TEMPUR-Ergo base?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b></b><b></b></p>
<h2><b>The Bottom Line on the Base</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mattresses, not their bases, make direct contact with sleepers. That doesn’t mean, however, that bases are less critical. After testing the TEMPUR-breeze first on their existing foundation and then the TEMPUR-Ergo, our sleepers reported a whole-sleep experience that was greater than the sum of its parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157038" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Power-Base-Bottom-281x300.jpeg" alt="" width="281" height="300" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Power-Base-Bottom-281x300.jpeg 281w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Power-Base-Bottom-150x160.jpeg 150w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Power-Base-Bottom-672x719.jpeg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first difference our testers noted was the power base’s range of motion. With their typical base, our testers used additional pillows to take the pressure off their shoulders for side sleeping. The TEMPUR-Ergo allows the user to raise the head of the bed as high as 57° and the foot up to 46°. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might sound like an unnecessarily broad range, but it opened up a variety of new in-bed activities for one of our testers. For the first time in her life, she reported, she could read and write comfortably while sitting in bed. Although her job requires her to spend large amounts of time on those activities, she’d always experienced a degree of discomfort when practicing them in bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s important to note that </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40502893/this-is-how-working-in-bed-impacts-your-productivity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Company suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working from bed may cause more stress, figures from Winston Churchill to John Lennon </span><a href="https://www.claudia-moruzzi.com/blogs/news/6-famous-people-who-worked-from-bed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">swore that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the practice helped to bring out their best. Whether it’s a good idea or not, the TEMPUR-Ergo seems to be designed with that capability in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our testers were similarly fond of the TEMPUR-Ergo’s other powerful features. The TEMPUR-Ergo’s “Zero-G” setting takes the pressure off a sleeper’s back by moving the bed to preset head and foot positions to supposedly simulate weightlessness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both testers felt the Zero-G position was comfortable to sleep in, though neither had experience sleeping in zero-gravity space. One sleeper suggested the setting was most noticeable when returning to a flat profile, likening it to lying in a draining tub and feeling her full weight return. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the TEMPUR-Ergo’s “two-zone massage” setting, which vibrates the bed with varying levels of intensity? In addition to steady modes, the bed can vibrate in cycles around both the user’s head and feet. To avoid wasting energy, the bed’s vibration settings turn off automatically after 30 minutes. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157040" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Remote-Mattress-Base-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Remote-Mattress-Base-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Remote-Mattress-Base-120x160.jpeg 120w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Remote-Mattress-Base-539x719.jpeg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our testers agreed that the setting couldn’t replicate an authentic massage’s ability to relieve muscle aches, but neither disliked the experience. One user likened the sensation to the feeling of a purring cat lying by her side. Both sleepers said the low- and moderate vibration modes helped them fall asleep faster. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157044" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Remote-Close-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Remote-Close-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Remote-Close-120x160.jpeg 120w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Remote-Close-539x719.jpeg 539w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the ancillary features didn’t wow our testers like the TEMPUR-Ergo’s anti-gravity and vibration features, they appreciated the thoughtful extras nonetheless. One of the testers especially liked the under-bed lighting, which is dim enough to not wake her partner in the middle of the night. Adjustable legs and USB ports provide additional convenience and customization opportunities, particularly for our tester who likes to use his tablet in bed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b></b><b></b><b></b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-157039" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Under-Bed-Lighting-252x300.jpeg" alt="" width="252" height="300" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Under-Bed-Lighting-252x300.jpeg 252w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Under-Bed-Lighting-134x160.jpeg 134w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LuxeBreeze-Under-Bed-Lighting-604x719.jpeg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /></p>
<h2><b>A Better Bed?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All told, our testers gave the TEMPUR-breeze an “A-.” The TEMPUR-Ergo received an “A.” Here’s how they broke it down:</span></p>
<h3><b>Pros:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideal for sleepers who like to stay cool.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accommodates multiple sleeping positions via an adjustable base.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May help side sleepers switch to other sleeping positions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to set up, especially given that the delivery team assembles the bed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May ease orthopedic pain, though users seeking pain relief should be sure to talk to their doctor.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Cons:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensive. Although the sleep system we tested retails for $5,998, frequent sales mean buyers often pay less. Tempur-Pedic’s </span><a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/warranties/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warranty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> covers the mattress for 10 years and the base for 25 years. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevation is broad but limited. One tester felt additional leg elevation would have improved his sleep experience. [Hence, my additional mention that this option is available in the Ergo Extend &#8212; though we didn&#8217;t try this mattress system out to confirm anything].<br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TEMPUR-Ergo base moves as a single unit. Buyers who prefer different settings than their partner may prefer the TEMPUR-Ergo Extend, (you can choose the twin-together option, if needed) which accommodates this type of individuality.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, our testers concluded, traditional mattresses — at least those at the top — still have the edge over bed-in-a-box mattresses. For those willing to pay a premium price for premium sleep, Tempur-Pedic’s TEMPUR-breeze and TEMPUR-Ergo can certainly provide it.</span></p>

The assumption that PR is advertising is evident with the core PR success metric being Advertising Value Equivalency (AVE). It&#8217;s no wonder that more and more organizations are focused on telling their brand story through PR.</p>
<p><em>US data even tells us that there are</em> <a href="https://www.ragan.com/census-6-pr-pros-for-every-journalist/"><em>6 PR Pros for every 1 Journalist.</em></a><em> This statistic has been a 2x increase in 10 years all the while newsrooms are shrinking.</em></p>
<p>These known metrics from the AVE makes it super important that organizations start to take PR seriously. Creating a press release and blasting it out via a news wire no longer cuts it. You need to strategize and be meticulous with your PR approach to ensure your company&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>The discussion here points to the core PR mistakes that are made by companies regularly. I&#8217;ve also provided you with tips for improving your PR workflow.</p>
<h2><strong>#1 Mistake: No Research or Understanding</strong></h2>
<p>Getting PR for your organization can be a massive boost to business and awareness. You&#8217;ll need to focus your PR efforts where you can reap the fruits of your labor. Knowing where your focus must require a certain level of understanding and effort.</p>
<p>Your level of understanding these issues is where things get out of shape. Smaller businesses especially make the mistake of chasing the public eye but fail at the most basic of hurdles. Where does the problem start? Researching and understanding both the journalist and the publication that you are reaching out to mark your beginning.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s role play. You wouldn&#8217;t reach out to a prospective buyer who you didn&#8217;t research first, would you? The same applies to get that media &#8220;buy-in,&#8221; which can be looked at in the same context as trying to arrange a sales meeting or converting someone. Let&#8217;s break these two core problems down and get some ideas going to help combat this.</p>
<h3><strong>Not Understanding the Journalist.</strong></h3>
<p>Journalists aren&#8217;t starving for stories; they are not waiting for the next big thing to appear in their inbox. These people have editorial calendars to maintain and accounts to research. Pitching a tech angle when a journalist covers health-care tech, for example, will not generate coverage. The added &#8220;health-care&#8221; detail ensures your latest productivity app won&#8217;t be a fit for the journalist.</p>
<p>Imagine the stress you feel when getting a cold call that doesn&#8217;t even make sense to you. Imagine the same for a journalist, but instead of the wrong product pitch from one company, you get 10&#8217;s of pitches throughout the day that have zero to do with anything the journalist is looking for.</p>
<h3><strong>Not Hitting the Right Publications.</strong></h3>
<p>More on this later in the article but this is an issue that repeats itself time and time again. Hitting the right publication generally happens when a media list is purchased, and the spray and pray method is applied. Because there was a lack of research done, the outreach will be reduced and filled with gaps. Wasting your time, the journalists&#8217; time and only adding to the negative sentiment that is felt with media relations these days is the end result of the action.</p>
<h4><strong>Ideas to Consider.</strong></h4>
<p>Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google are tools that you use on a daily basis. These three tools provide plenty of information to you in seconds so that you can run a gut-check without wasting anyone&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>If you want that coverage, then allow yourself the time of day to do the research to help you better understand the journalist and the publication. If time is an issue and doing everything manually is off-putting, but you still want PR &#8212; then take a moment and spend it <a href="https://www.prezly.com/academy/productivity/workflow/21-pr-tools-that-will-make-you-say-yay">reviewing the PR software out there.</a> PR software has already been designed that will help you improve in all areas of communications.</p>
<h2><strong>#2 Mistake: Spreading No-News</strong></h2>
<p>As much as you may be proud of your business or accomplishments, it doesn&#8217;t always need a PR push. Many PR failures start with the basics, and having a story to tell is about as basic (necessary) as you can get with PR.</p>
<p>Journalists want people to read their story. So they need something interesting that is going to drive conversation and eyeballs to their story. Is your news going to drive the conversation?</p>
<h3><strong>Self-Promotion.</strong></h3>
<p>When you are a small or lesser-known brand, product updates generally get shunned for the more prominent names. Why? Because bigger names equal more people, who use the product or have heard of it which has a net result of more readers.</p>
<h3><strong>Generic and Common Angles.</strong></h3>
<p>Generic and common angles stories are not going to drive readers or shares. If you want coverage, then you need to have achieved or accomplished something that few others have.</p>
<p>For example, investment or funding generates news more or less every time. Why? Because people will have an opinion on the value of the company or funding. Pondering what they could achieve with the investment makes for good reading if you have garnered an angle worth reading about. A new idea or a fresh thought on an old story or issue will drive clicks and eyeballs to the story.</p>
<h4><strong>Ideas to Consider.</strong></h4>
<p>Writing a blog post for most small businesses is more than enough. Your blog can operate however you determine to run it. Get more readers by boosting posts on social media (again, the audience will tell you if the story is interesting or not via the number of click-throughs).</p>
<p>Editorial calendars: create one, collect publication and journalists calendars, and align the two together. This list will give journalists a go-to source for future stories, and you know what to expect and when.</p>
<h2><strong>#3 Mistake: No Media Relations</strong></h2>
<p>Focus on the word relation here. <a href="https://www.frac.tl/work/marketing-research/pitching-pet-peeves/">Having someone&#8217;s email address</a> isn’t the same as having ties or relations. A relationship doesn’t appear by magic, out of nowhere; you&#8217;ll need to spend time and base the relationship on a mutually beneficial situation.</p>
<p>The easiest way to think about <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/04/09/what-to-consider-when-choosing-an-influencer-marketing-agency/">media relations</a> is to view it as strategic account management. Connections are created through building rapport, connecting with individuals, and understanding what it is they need and want for them to be successful.</p>
<p>But there is a real lack of focus on relations when it comes to PR and organizations. Most forget about the basics and bombard journalists with all kinds of non-sense and expect instant replies and coverage.</p>
<h3><strong>Too Many Follow-Ups.</strong></h3>
<p>Follow-ups are an essential part of PR. People are busy, and sometimes a nudge can help to refresh their memory. That being said, there is no need to follow-up with journalists every day or wait a week and then try again. Most news is old by then and would have either been covered elsewhere or was not of interest.</p>
<p>Keep follow-ups to about two to three times before calling it a day.</p>
<h3><strong>Cold Calling.</strong></h3>
<p>This is a tricky one. Many of my PR successes have come from cold calling and speaking to the journalist and building relations. That said, cold calling becomes a real issue when the caller has made no effort in understanding the publication/journalist.</p>
<p>If you want to cold call, make sure you have done substantial research beforehand.</p>
<h3><strong>Mass Email Blast.</strong></h3>
<p>Mass email blasts of <a href="https://blog.justreachout.io/how-to-write-press-release/">PR Releases such as these</a> generally mean journalists are added to a media contacts list which is purchased online. Minor personal touches such as &#8212; %f_name% &#8212; are included, and that&#8217;s a wrap. This type of media is not good enough, and a journalist will see right through it &#8212; and be aggravated with you.  Volume does not drive results; it does the opposite in fact, which is why serious consideration needs to be taken when looking into media lists.</p>
<h4><strong>Ideas to Consider.</strong></h4>
<p>Start over with your approach and take time out to start to research the journalists and publications. Take the time to build relations by sending intro emails out, mention a journalists article on social media or link to it.</p>
<p>Trying various account management ideas can provide some great tips on media relations too. Ultimately, take the time to review competitor coverage, industry coverage, and build a list of key contacts will be your best strategy moving forward.</p>
<h2><strong>#4 Mistake: Lack of a Pitch</strong></h2>
<p>Researching your journalists and taking the time out to understand them is one part of the public relations puzzle. Next comes the pitch. The almighty pitch, as you already guessed it, is another issue for small businesses.</p>
<p>Pitching is both an art and science. Both of these talents can be learned, but they <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/09/6-tips-to-automate-your-marketing/">require time</a>, practice, and wisdom to be successful. The wisdom part comes through building and sustaining the relationship.</p>
<p>Small business PR can at times seem like it is nothing more than a promotional sales document that has been added into the pitch and attached as a PDF. There can be too much or too little information given in a pitch, which for a journalist requires more time on fact-finding and checking.</p>
<h4><strong>Ideas to Consider.</strong></h4>
<p>When pitching, focus on delivering a short intro to the story, the main content with the critical information included, and a closing statement.</p>
<p>Adding <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/22/how-to-turn-your-buyers-into-brand-believers/">critical information</a> that is key to the story being interesting, leave out the smaller details and link to files and documents rather than attaching to the email.</p>
<p>Practice pitching by not pitching your business or product. Focus on pitching a piece of content you found that should be considered for inclusion in a journalists article or future pieces. Frequent conversations tend to make pitching far more effective as relations improve.</p>
<h2><strong>#5 Mistake: Targeting Only Top Media</strong></h2>
<p>Big media outlets provide significant metrics that we all want to see &#8212; high traffic, high referrals, more business, increased brand awareness. It&#8217;s only right that all PR activities should be focused on top media. But, top media won&#8217;t matter if your audience isn&#8217;t there and your piece doesn&#8217;t apply to the nature of the publication.</p>
<p>For example, a B2B organization will struggle to gain coverage from gossip newspapers. A B2B organization may be a great company and have large reader numbers. However, the customers and clients won&#8217;t pick up your information if you&#8217;re not where they get their information in the first place. You won&#8217;t see any benefit from getting coverage if your prospects are not there. Plenty of organizations are wasting resources<a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/02/26/thanks-tech-for-strategic-advantage-on-tv/"> trying to get coverage</a> from publications which are not suitable for their intended targets.</p>
<h4><strong>Ideas to Consider.</strong></h4>
<p>Quality over quantity is vital here. You should only reach out to relevant publications that are suitable for your audience. If your clients and customer only happen to read three smaller publications &#8212; then you&#8217;ll need to focus all efforts on media relations.</p>
<p>Start small with smaller blogs that are relevant to you and start building from there. If you can get coverage from multiple smaller outlets, and you have success, then pitching top media will become easier, and so will the angle that you can use.</p>

Technological leaps in the past years have led to an overhaul in the traditional workplace definitions and paved the way for flexible work.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/reports/199961/7.aspx">Gallup report</a> on State of the American workplace, 43 percent of the workforce spent at least some of their time working remotely and these numbers are slated to increase consistently in the years to come.</p>
<p>Balancing organizational productivity while providing the employees with the flexibility they desire can be a tough task. The question that most organizations struggle with is how to prepare for the future, which will constitute of flexible workforce and teams working remotely. Here is a list of things you need to keep in mind while managing a remote workforce.</p>
<h3>1. Have a communication strategy in place.</h3>
<p>Effective communication is the key to workplace efficiency. Leverage technology to ensure that your team stays in sync even though they may be physically in different geographical locations.</p>
<p>Have a communication strategy which is aimed at creating the digital workspace where the team’s progress can be tracked in real-time, queries can be resolved, project updates can be delivered and which acts as a place where the team can bond even if they are not present in the same physical location.</p>
<p>Communication tools like Slack, Zoom, and Skype can be a great resource when managing a remote workforce. Incorporation of project management software such as Trello, Asana, and Jira are of great tools for team collaboration.</p>
<p>Web and cloud-based file sharing solutions like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. allow you to access key documents when working remotely securely, and can facilitate more efficient collaborative projects. Use of these collaboration and communication tools ensures that all the efforts of your remote teams are streamlined in the same direction.</p>
<p>If the members of your flexible workforce happen to be in different time zones, schedule a communication time that works best for everyone and ensure that everyone is brought up to speed and every team member is on the same page in regards to the project. Optimize virtual communication and use digital tools to discuss the problems, progress, and plans. Regular interactions within the teams are the key to a productive workforce that operates remotely.</p>
<p>Lastly, certain situations demand meetings with the employees take place in a face to face manner. Periodic scheduling of regular meetings can give an effective boost to communications. Ensure productive scheduling of meetings, and this will make sure that the time of both remote, as well as in-office employees, is well spent and genuine communication with the contribution of ideas takes place.</p>
<h3>2. Offer flexibility but measure productivity.</h3>
<p>The advantage that <a href="https://myresumeseed.com/remote-jobs/">remote work</a> offers to the employees is freedom from the 9-5 face time in the office premises. The downside that many companies feel is that you cannot track the actual amount of time that is spent doing the work. But do you even need to?</p>
<p>Instead of the traditional approach that focused on how much time the employee spends sitting at the desk, it is necessary to take on a result-oriented approach. Measure productivity by setting up deadlines within which the work needs to be wrapped up.</p>
<p>For example, if your development team functions remotely, rather than focusing on the screen time and computing the hours spent writing the code, you should instead focus on whether the projects are being completed within the estimated timeline.</p>
<p>The employees have the flexibility to work whenever and wherever they want as long as the work gets done. The organization benefits from having the work finished promptly and also end up with a motivated and more productive workforce. Having complete control over the work is done often leads to better results, healthier workplace relationships, and ultimately, greater employee retention.</p>
<h3>3. Focus on maintaining the company culture.</h3>
<p>Just because your workforce is remote doesn’t mean that they get to be disconnected from the company culture. The core values that the organization functions on are instrumental in forming the company culture and are responsible for an employee’s engagement within the organization.</p>
<p>Communicating the company culture to the employees and encouraging them to implement in their everyday work results in higher motivation with the teams working towards building something they care about.</p>
<p>The focus on the company culture should start right from the hiring process itself to judge how well the individual would fit within the organization. Ensuring that an employee is a cultural fit within the organization becomes even more important when you offer work flexibility.</p>
<p>Even if remote working is a possibility, collaborating with the other members of the team is a necessity. For instance, if you are hiring a developer, while the technical skills and knowledge of the <a href="https://arkenea.com/blog/tech-stack-php-vs-python/">tech stacks</a> are essential, the people skills and collaborative capabilities should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<h3>4. Establish a feedback and training loop.</h3>
<p>Constructive criticism and actionable feedback from the coworkers, customers, and employers are even more significant for remote teams. The chances of conflict increase multifold when the team isn’t available for resolving the issues, assumptions, and misconceptions that arise in the course of the work, in a face to face manner. A feedback loop becomes a must to weed out these possible detractors.</p>
<p>A robust set of policies, feedback, and training loop ensures digital connectivity establishes a culture of support and trust that the flexible workforce can rely on. Make sure to include both the in house as well as remote teams when designing training and development session for your employees.</p>
<p>Training should not only focus on the technological aspects and newer tools such as leveraging AI but also have sessions on tips to becoming an efficient remote worker and leading virtual teams. A work culture that is focused on continuous improvement allows for personal growth, which leads to higher engagement and increased employee loyalty to the organization.</p>

These threats call for more robust security tools and strategies to protect our data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the rapid rate of advancement in cyber threats deems it necessary that we constantly adapt to developments in the cyber world. Browser extensions belong to the group of tools brought about by technological innovations. These tools, though often overlooked, should be put to use on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a whole lot of extensions out there for productivity, customization, shopping, games, and more. They can modify the user interface, block ads on Web pages, translate text from one language to another, or add pages to a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2019/feb/07/back-up-bookmarks-google"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third-party bookmark service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as Evernote or Pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oftentimes, your job will determine the type of extensions you’ll have installed. As an online marketing consultant, I have </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-analysis-tools"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loads of website review tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> installed, alongside security tools like </span><a href="https://www.urban-vpn.com/free-products/free-browser-extension/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UrbanVPN free extension</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These extensions make my work a whole lot easier and protect my devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some extensions help to ensure swift activation and unlimited bandwidth that allow you to stream and download content with ease and speed.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/03/29/evaluating-popular-web-browsers-in-terms-of-security-and-privacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular web browsers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Edge support extensions. These extensions are readily available with some more helpful than others.</span></p>
<h2><b>4 Popular Free Extensions and the Important Roles They Play</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A browser extension is a lightweight software application that can extend your web browser with </span><a href="https://readwrite.com/2009/05/28/the_first_google_chrome_extensions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, modify web pages, and integrate your browser with the other services you use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of these extensions is that quite a handful of them are free. Let’s take a look at these five popular free extensions and the important roles they play.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><b> Grammarly</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-155220 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Grammarly-screenshot.png" alt="" width="627" height="473" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Grammarly-screenshot.png 627w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Grammarly-screenshot-212x160.png 212w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Grammarly-screenshot-300x226.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grammarly ensures all your messages, documents, and social media posts are clear, mistake-free, and impactful. Adding Grammarly to Chrome means that your spelling and grammar will be vetted on Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Tumblr, and nearly everywhere else you write on the web. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you register your new account, you will start to receive weekly emails with </span><a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/grammarly-writing-stats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized insights and performance stats. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can create and store all of your documents in your new online editor.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><b> UrbanVPN</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-155221 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Urban-free-vpn-addon.png" alt="" width="631" height="354" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Urban-free-vpn-addon.png 631w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Urban-free-vpn-addon-260x146.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Urban-free-vpn-addon-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /></p>

Urban VPN Browser Extension offers you </span><a href="https://www.urban-vpn.com/free-products/free-browser-extension/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quick and easy activation and unlimited bandwidth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It keeps your browser activities safe and private, protects your browser from harmful advertising and protects your device from malware and other vulnerabilities when using public Wi-Fi connections. Urban VPN allows you to surf safely without fear of personal information theft, among other security risks.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><b> Avast SafePrice</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-155222 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Avast-SafePrice.png" alt="" width="624" height="394" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Avast-SafePrice.png 624w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Avast-SafePrice-253x160.png 253w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Avast-SafePrice-300x189.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Avast-SafePrice-160x102.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though online shopping reduces the stress you have to go through any time you want to purchase a product, it did not completely eliminate the stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free Avast SafePricce browser extension, however, has totally eliminated this problem. You can now find the best prices, deals, and discount coupons while shopping online with the </span><a href="https://www.avast.com/safeprice"><span style="font-weight: 400;">price comparison and coupon extension by Avast.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve installed the extension, just search for the item you’re looking for on any online store. Avast SafePrice then automatically checks every other trustworthy, reputable shopping website and gives you a comprehensive list of the best online deals and free coupons.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><b> FlowCrypt</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-155223 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FlowCrypt.png" alt="" width="631" height="403" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FlowCrypt.png 631w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FlowCrypt-251x160.png 251w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FlowCrypt-300x192.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FlowCrypt-160x102.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlowCrypt adds a Secure Compose button to Gmail and G Suite. This way, you can send private PGP encrypted emails when you choose to. The extension lets you use </span><a href="https://readwrite.com/2014/06/06/google-gmail-encryption-fail-comcast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PGP end-to-end encryption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by generating a private and public key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">File encryption is also fully supported. You just open a compose window in order to encrypt an attachment, then add the recipient&#8217;s private email, and attach a file.</span></p>
<h2><b>Potential Threats Surrounding Browser Extensions</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><b> Malicious extensions</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very first thing is that extensions can be outrightly malicious. This is found mostly with extensions that come from third-party websites, but we may also have situations where malware sneaks into official markets as well as in cases with Android and Google Play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, security researchers in 2018 </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/500000-chrome-users-fall-prey-to-malicious-extensions-in-google-web-store/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uncovered four malicious extensions in the Google Chrome Web Store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was not a case of isolation as there were reports that in late July and early August of 2017, unknown attackers compromised the accounts of at least two Chrome extension developers. The criminals then used their unauthorized access to automatically install </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/after-phishing-attacks-chrome-extensions-push-adware-to-millions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extension updates that injected ads into the sites visited by users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in August, Renato Marinho, who is the chief research officer of Morpheus Labs and a volunteer at the SANS Institute, uncovered an elaborate bank-fraud scam that </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/bank-fraud-malware-not-detected-by-any-av-hosted-in-chrome-web-store-twice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">used a malicious extension in Google&#8217;s Chrome Web Store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to steal targets&#8217; passwords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extension is not supposed to do that but the problem is that only Google Chrome requires permissions among the commonly used browsers, and users are usually powerless to do anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even basic extensions usually require permission to “read and change all your data on the websites you visit,” which gives them the power to do virtually anything with your data. And if you don’t give them that permission, they won’t be installed.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><b> Hijacking and buying extensions</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most times, users download harmless extensions, which are automatically updated. Hackers are aware of this fact and as a result of the massive user base which they find inviting, they easily upload malicious extensions without the knowledge of the user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethical developers usually don’t do such things but these crooks often hijack their accounts and malicious updates can be uploaded to the official store on their behalf. That’s the scenario you have any time hackers </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/after-phishing-attacks-chrome-extensions-push-adware-to-millions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use phishing to get access to the credentials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crooked developers, on the other hand, when approached by malevolent companies that offer to purchase their extensions for a handsome sum cave in. Extensions are pretty difficult to monetize, hence, some developers sell out without minding the consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such companies, after purchasing the extension, go about updating it with malicious features and contents. Invariably, the malicious updates are pushed to users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the case for </span><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/-particle-chrome-extension-sold-to-new-dev-who-immediately-turns-it-into-adware/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a popular Chrome extension for customizing YouTube that was abandoned by its developers. The company that bought it over converted it into adware.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><b> Dangerous but not malicious</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some extensions that are not malicious but dangerous. The danger arises because most extensions have the ability to collect a lot of data about users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, these data are not incognito enough, which can cause serious privacy issues. The parties that purchase the data can identify the users of the plugin. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://readwrite.com/2010/12/03/search_engine_duckduckgo_partners_with_web_of_trus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web of Trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a once-popular plugin for Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, and other browsers encountered this problem. The plugin was used to rate websites based on crowdsourced opinion as well as collecting the full browsing history of its users.</span></p>
<h2><b>Rounding it up</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that extensions can be dangerous, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/04/why-browser-extensions-change-the-way-we-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some of them are really useful</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that’s why you probably wouldn’t want to abandon them completely. It&#8217;s advisable to download and activate trustworthy extensions like the ones discussed above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With browser extension features such as hiding your IP address and browser history, it’s a fact that when discussing </span><a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/02/20/unblocking-websites-and-accessing-restricted-contents-the-ultimate-guide-for-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ways to unblock websites and access unlimited contents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online, browser extensions are definitely one solution that can&#8217;t be overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the risks of browser extensions are quite real. Security awareness training which is highly recommended must stress that users should never install unknown extensions. </span></p>

These ecosystems maintain complex relationships among many different types of organisms that produce breathable air and enhance water resources for our use.</p>
<p>Human activity damages these ecosystems causing unpredictable changes that affect climate. IoT has long <a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/04/29/internet-of-things-climate-change-cl4/">been proposed</a> as a solution for climate change problem, and in this article, I will outline a specific approach on how IoT should be implemented in environmental programs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155851 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OJAX470.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1067" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OJAX470.jpg 1600w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OJAX470-240x160.jpg 240w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OJAX470-300x200.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OJAX470-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pollution and climate change are real.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past 100 years, human activity has impacted all of those ecosystems heavily, and it fires back already. Nowadays, air pollution is one of the most significant killers in the world, resulting in </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/pollution-and-health"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 9 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deaths a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the global average water deficit is only 11%, in 31 countries the water deficit ranges from 25% to 70%, and in 22 countries this figure </span><a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367306"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceeds 70%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And human activities such as deforestation, land-use changes, and burning fossil fuels aggravate these problems.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155854 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="687" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0.jpg 1600w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-260x112.jpg 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-300x129.jpg 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-900x386.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, human activity creates long-lasting effects on climate, changing the complex structures that maintain all life on Earth. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Greenhouse gases, like CO2, have a “heat-trapping” effect that destroys Earth’s “energy budget” and results in global temperature rise, glacier retreat and extreme weather events like drought and storms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans need natural resources and ecosystems to survive. And there is a pollution limit that Earth can handle, and we have long passed it. Natural ecosystems are used for free to dump pollution. But like any limited resource, they are not free. The cost has just been postponed for far too long. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/02/climate/pricing-carbon-emissions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 40 countries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have already introduced the price of carbon in one way or another. And voluntary environmental programs grow in numbers all over the world. Ecological assets are becoming critical financial instruments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most well known of which are carbon credits &#8211; the right to emit 1 tCO2e. But there are also forest carbon stocks, water restoration certificates, and many others.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do existing efforts fail?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sure environmental programs work, we need a robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system to make sure that environmental assets are legit and real-world data supports the issued assets. MRV process is crucial for climate change mitigation efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countries and supranational organizations develop standards for MRV process, but it is often carried out by private auditing and environmental services companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the UN has published a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">handbook</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the MRV process, the standards and variables are still not always clear. Additionally, the MRV process happens over multiple years and is usually a slow and rigid procedure which is complicated by many factors like information quality, types of data, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more so, MRV costs are subject to a strong economy of scale as smaller countries bear the over-proportional burden as they need to go through an unknown and complicated procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most importantly, investors are still wary about investing in environmental assets due to the lack of trust. MRV process has been criticized over the past years in multiple countries as some certificates that were issued were not supported by climate change mitigation activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These reasons affect the attractiveness of environmental assets, and even though investors are interested in supporting these assets, they are still concerned about them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT adoption in environmental programs.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The future will be characterized by smart devices delivering increasingly insightful digital services everywhere.” &#8211; </span>David Cearley, Gartner Vice President</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gartner, one of the leading IT research companies, </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified “autonomous things”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Robotics, Vehicles, Drones, Appliances, and Agents) among the significant strategic technology trends in 2019. This trend is especially relevant in environmental programs where MRV process can be improved dramatically by introducing autonomous solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devices are becoming smaller, cheaper, and, most importantly, smarter. For the governments and companies involved in the MRV process, they become an essential source of information that was impossible to gather before. IoT makes the MRV process cheaper and more effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network of stationary sensors can provide a stable source of historical data about air or water pollution. For example, point source monitoring of water resources is a great example where IoT sensors can be installed in particular locations to monitor sewage outfalls or storm drains over some time.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155852 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-1.png" alt="" width="1280" height="773" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-1.png 1280w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-1-260x157.png 260w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-1-300x181.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-1-900x544.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, mobile robots such as drones or boats can collect data that was not accessible before. The wide adoption of drones has pushed the prices down, and they became available to use in environmental monitoring. Drones can collect air pollution data on different altitudes providing a full picture of air pollution in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As various monitoring devices are getting smaller and cheaper, more people start to engage in environmental monitoring activities. There is a number of </span><a href="https://citizen-obs.eu/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizens’ Observatories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects where citizens are becoming actively engaged stakeholders of the environmental monitoring process. Continuous engagement of an average citizen makes the MRV process as a whole more sustainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that consistent data collected from different sources increases the attractiveness of environmental assets for investors. However, the adoption of IoT and robotics in the MRV process has many challenges, including security and data protection.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation for efficient environmental program data management.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of public p2p technologies combined with data supplied by IoT devices, can become the basis for a fully autonomous and efficient MRV process. It is crucial to think about data security and immutability in environmental monitoring because the problem of trust is the biggest reason for investors to refuse to add environmental assets to their portfolio. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ethereum.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that offer smart contracts can take control over IoT networks to make sure that commands are performed correctly. And the use of </span><a href="https://ipfs.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content-addressable p2p storage platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can guarantee that data recorded by<a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/24/how-to-better-defend-against-cyber-threats/"> IoT devices </a>are secure and immutable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hash of the file will be saved in a smart contract to make sure that the job performed by an <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/13/5-ways-blockchain-startups-can-appeal-to-enterprises/">IoT device has a digital track record</a>, and every investor can see it. In return, an environmental asset is issued by environmental service providers fully autonomously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach allows to not only provide the historical data for investors in environmental assets but also organize the issuance of those assets in a secure way, making them accessible globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using this infrastructure, an environmental program operator can send a request for a monitoring mission to the device or robot in the area. The details about the mission will be recorded in p2p storage, and when the method is available, the smart contract will be created automatically linking the hash of the purpose. The smart contract triggers the mission and the recorded data is signed and saved to p2p storage straightaway to guarantee the accuracy and immutability of data. Environmental program operators can use it to issue ecological assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only by combining IoT networks with blockchain technology can we directly connect data collection and issuance of assets in a fully autonomous process!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-world use cases </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="http://dczd.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dczd.tech,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have been working on developing IoT solutions for environmental monitoring, reporting, and verification for the past year and </span><a href="https://medium.com/dczdtech/heres-how-robots-can-help-us-deal-with-pollution-e762159d0950"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have already shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several pilot projects in this area.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water resources monitoring</span></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155853 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-2.png" alt="" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-2.png 1200w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-2-213x160.png 213w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-2-300x225.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pasted-image-0-2-900x675.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over summer 2018, we have demonstrated a waterborne drone that can perform non-point water resource monitoring providing data that is impossible to collect using only stationary sensors. It can return to the base for calibration, which is not always that comfortable with stationary sensors in hard-to-reach areas. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/khassan0v/status/1121629648691974145"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, captured by the process, we even forgot to return it to the shore before the sun went down and the battery died while it was still in the middle of the river. But the next day, as the sun rose again, it charged itself using solar panels and returned to monitoring mission proving that robotics can be used over extended periods of time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Air pollution monitoring</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have also tested solutions for an air monitoring solution that can become the basis for fully autonomous carbon credit trading schemes. We have equipped a </span><a href="http://dji.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DJI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drone with </span><a href="http://libelium.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libelium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> air quality sensor allowing us to do quick air pollution monitoring in different locations and altitudes, which results in a much more detailed picture of how pollution spreads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/03/26/three-ways-you-must-evolve-the-way-you-approach-testing-in-the-iot-era/">comparing results with laboratory equipment</a>, we have proved that this method results in precise measurements, and the data can be used in environmental programs. In general, drone sensors record the content of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in atmospheric air at values close to the results obtained by standard methods (GANK 4 gas analyzer, spectrophotometry).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing deforestation.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, through a strategic alliance with </span><a href="http://ipci.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAO IPCI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have already signed two contracts for aboriginal forest monitoring as a part of the </span><a href="https://www.un-redd.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UN-REDD+ Programme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In summer 2019, we start the project in Papua New Guinea, where we deliver a drone monitoring solution that enables the environmental program operator to gather timely information about forest conditions and demonstrate this data to investors. The critical data increases the understanding and attractiveness of REDD+ assets, bringing investors to countries that need them the most.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental programs require innovative solutions to deal with the increasingly grave climate change and pollution problems. Widely available IoT devices controlled by smart contracts can allow scaling, monitoring, reporting, and verification processes making the whole process of issuing environmental assets fully autonomous.</span></p>

The canvases come with a one and a half-inch gallery wrap that makes them feel like artwork that you would find hanging on a museum or art gallery wall.</p>
<p>You can shop the entire collection, or you can look by categories. The categories include Motivation, Money, Power, Luxury, Monopoly, Seduction, and Interstellar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-157106 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.27.30-PM.png" alt="" width="1198" height="1246" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.27.30-PM.png 1198w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.27.30-PM-154x160.png 154w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.27.30-PM-288x300.png 288w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.27.30-PM-691x719.png 691w" sizes="(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px" /></p>
<p>When you select an artwork to look at more closely in their online shop, you get engaging product descriptions about the meaning behind the artwork and the title of the art. For example, the first one I bought for our company was entitled, &#8220;Duck Hunter.&#8221; Here is just a small quote from the unique product description that accompanied it:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Some people are farmers. This piece is NOT for them. It’s for their opposite: The Duck Hunters. See…The farmer’s mindset is to plant seeds… and wait around for the “right conditions.” They toil. And they never reap the rewards for their work until months—or years—later.</em></p>
<p><em>A Duck Hunter, on the other hand, knows the truth: It’s your birthright to go after any target you want right now. If you don’t, it’s game over. You’ll get laughed at, A Duck Hunter knows: the world can be yours as you want it. But YOU have to take it. And if you focus on your aim, you can possess the life of your greatest dreams.</em></p>
<p><em>Society wants you to live life like a Farmer. But that won’t get you ahead.&#8221;   </em></p>
<p>I had never purchased any motivational artwork that ever provided such compelling, well-thought meanings to what the art meant. I&#8217;ll admit what took the longest in this purchase process is getting lost in reading all these product descriptions. One was better than the next.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-157107 size-full" src="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.40.48-PM.png" alt="" width="1246" height="1200" srcset="https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.40.48-PM.png 1246w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.40.48-PM-166x160.png 166w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.40.48-PM-300x289.png 300w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.40.48-PM-747x719.png 747w, https://images.readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-2.40.48-PM-40x40.png 40w" sizes="(max-width: 1246px) 100vw, 1246px" /></p>
<p>Since that initial purchase, we&#8217;ve bought many more. One example is &#8220;Level Up.&#8221; Again, the meaning to the title and the visuals were important to us personally because it so closely matched our company vision and culture. Here&#8217;s an excerpt, so you see what I mean:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Some people fear elevators. They think it’s like the movies, where the cable can break, and you plummet to your death. But elevators are statistically the safest form of transportation in the world. Safer than planes, trains, even less harmless than a child’s tricycle. Some people still harbor this irrational fear because they feel they’re going up when they ride one. That feeling alone deludes them into thinking they can fall—so they panic.</em></p>
<p><em>Now, there are more people afraid of “leveling up” to success than there are of riding elevators. But it’s the same irrational fear at work. As you climb higher and pass each new level, be it risk, criticism, failure, or blind ambition, it can feel uncomfortable to you. It causes panic. It’s why most people quit on their dreams.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>You can also shop their Instagram canvas art options, featuring specific art that has been featured on this social media channel.</p>
<h2>Ordering Process</h2>
<p>Their ordering process is easy and straightforward for an online process. Whether I ordered from my laptop or my mobile device, it was quick. Once I knew which canvas I wanted, I could click on one of four sizes and add it to my cart. It also automatically entered the available coupon code for the current promotional discount.</p>
<p>In terms of payment options, there are many to choose from. They accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and PayPal. During the checkout process, I noticed that they listed two types of checkout and payment security software to keep the transaction safe.</p>
<h2>What We Like</h2>
<p>Our office loves the unique visual choices offered. Ther are so many options available that it was difficult to choose. However, another thing our company liked was the price point. These are good quality for the cost, which has allowed us to continue adding these canvases throughout our offices and common areas.</p>
<p>Shipping is fast, and the packaging protected the canvases, so nothing was damaged. It took seconds to hang each canvas on the wall.</p>
<p>Also, customer service is highly responsive. I left a voice mail and received a call-back in less than 30 minutes. There was nothing to not like about this company or what they offered.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>I recommend that you sign-up and subscribe by giving Inktuitive your email address. In return, you get exclusive access to new releases and 15% off your first order. These canvas prints also make great gifts for colleagues and even the boss!</p>

Advertisements drive revenue and the incentive for search engines to manipulate results in their favor. Even if more searchers once preferred organic results over paid, search engines <a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-organic-clicks-shifting-to-paid">have found ways</a> to slowly change consumer sentiment, likely by delivering better results aligned with searcher intent.</p>
<p>In technology-driven industries, the only real constant is change. Change in such sectors can happen quickly and heavily disrupt the status quo, eviscerating once vital companies. The word processor killed the typewriter, VOIP changed the model of the landline telecom sector and the bidet [should have] killed toilet paper. Alas, the next touted future disruptions in AI are set to disrupt nearly every industry, stealing many viable jobs in their wake. The following represent a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machines in manufacturing, logistics and processing</li>
<li>3D printing for everything from spare parts to consumable products</li>
<li>Self-driving cars in transportation (including the subsequent decline in insurance claims)</li>
<li>Blockchain and <a href="https://readwrite.com/2018/10/23/robo-advisors-are-coming-so-whats-stopping-them/">robo-advisors in financial services</a></li>
<li>Internet of Things (IoT) for device tracking and management</li>
<li>Spatial and quantum computing</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in coding, communication and marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>Job and industry-shifting technology will prove a boon in some areas and highly-disruptive in others. Content marketing, and link building in particular, is not immune to the coming wave of <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/05/30/artificial-intelligence-can-improve-business-growth/">business bots, artificial intelligence</a> and automation.</p>
<h3>Impact of AI-Driven Link Building</h3>
<p>Whether judging email or backlinks, artificially intelligent crawlers are getting better at filtering for quality. But, the AI-powered content creation tools are <a href="https://www.adweek.com/creativity/agencys-fake-blog-shows-how-ai-generated-content-could-spam-the-web-to-death/">improving in lockstep</a>. Here&#8217;s what this means for the future of the web, including the heavy-lifting activity of building links for SEO:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infinite Content</strong>. When the cost of content is fixed and not variable, it gives anyone with the machine capable of creating it, the ability to produce an unlimited supply. Yes, the demand for quality content will always be present, but what happens to the price of content when the supply is infinite and the cost is virtually zero?</li>
<li><strong>Link Velocity</strong>. In a world where the speed of content production (and thereby the speed of link acquisition) is unlimited, the velocity of procured links can be manipulated to highly-unnatural levels quickly. However, programming an AI content bot to build content and links at a natural frequency that meets the threshold of appearing &#8220;natural&#8221; is as simple as a line or two of code.</li>
<li><strong>Services Becomes a Product</strong>. When a service-driven industry, powered by humans, is overtaken by AI and bots, what was once an expensive, time-consuming <a href="https://seo.co/link-building-services/">link building service</a>, quickly devolves into a systematized commodity product, complete with a minimal cost and monthly service plan.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Deserves Freshness</strong>. When content supply is infinite, it smacks in the face of Google&#8217;s QDF (quality deserves freshness) algorithm. Massive amounts of even meaningful AI-produced content may not hold the same ranking value of existing pieces deemed more &#8220;evergreen.&#8221; In a future day, content is likely to require some type of bifurcation or visual categorization to separate live alerts from long-form informational pieces. But, in the end, how will one know whether such information was created by a human or a machine?</li>
</ul>
<p>But, when services become commodity products, nothing is left for differentiation. Publishing more content inevitably becomes a race to the bottom.</p>
<h3>Penny Wise and Publisher Foolish</h3>
<p>Tempting as it may seem to eventually automate one&#8217;s external content marketing and link building, there remain a few key hurdles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not all content is created equal</strong>. Bots have yet been able to replicate the complexity and beauty of Mozart, the Mona Lisa or Rudyard Kipling. Similarly, quality-crafted content is timeless, evergreen and is what truly drives traffic and eyeballs. In short, it&#8217;s tough to replicate the wit and style of a truly gifted writer. This is one of the reasons, search engines heavily track spam, discount links whose content is created simply for contents&#8217; sake and punish abuses that make backlink profiles appear unnatural. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/02/23/ai-learning-algorithms-find-your-new-target-groups/">AI is smart, but it&#8217;s not that smart</a>, yet.</li>
<li><strong>Not all content serves the same purpose</strong>. Content created by bots is generally used for shorter, timely, news-like pieces, not the long-form, witty and educational content typically seen in most written online pieces. When bots finally do emerge en masse, they&#8217;ll likely be performing the more mundane tasks of regurgitated news pieces and automated Twitter posts. We&#8217;re already seeing this in pockets, but not at a larger scale. The most beautiful, timeless pieces are more likely to be created by those with creative minds, something AI has yet to fully master.</li>
<li><strong>Content is not created in a vacuum</strong>. Content often does not stand alone, especially online content. This is the very reason hyperlinks were invented in the first place. As a reference they allow the user to further explore the arguments, details or claims of a given topic. They lead users (not just webcrawlers) to various cited sources where other quality content exists. A single piece of content, regardless of how good it is, is always best augmented by another piece, whether linking to it or linking away from it. Why does this matter as it relates to AI? Because not all content serves the same purpose, it stands to reason that even the best AI-driven content will lack the human element of reference (e.g. &#8220;here&#8217;s what my friend John Doe, says on the subject&#8221; &#8211;with inserted hyperlink). No, loss of the human element may mean we lose the attention of those that matter most&#8211;the humans.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it may ultimately be tempting to outsource content production to AI bots or even overseas firms, the reality is that both the quality of the content and where it is placed is not something that should be left to chance. No, even the most deliberately-built content and links require a focus on the upper echelons of quality.</p>
<h3>The Link Builder&#8217;s Dilemma</h3>
<p>Even with deliberately-created quality content, risks remain for those hunkered to the idea that link building is the end-all of SEO and content marketing. In-line with the tenants of the famed book by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma"><em>The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</em></a>, innovation in link building and content marketing includes a similarly-structured framework.</p>
<p>Like any good disruptive innovation, content bots will focus on and begin to dominate niches like those news pieces previously discussed. Smaller markets, according to the framework, have more fluid futures that are more difficult to predict. Larger existing players are therefore more reticent to become an entrant. In addition, demand for AI-powered content remains low as it still sits on the sidelines, but its eventual rise could quickly quell the current status quo.</p>
<p>Worse still, and even more likely, is the eventual shifting of search engine algorithms to move away from backlinks as one of the primary signals of value and authority for websites. Artificial intelligence may eventually find other ways to determine searcher intent and truly add value to those seeking information via online search. Dwell-time, social shares and other signals are more likely to prove the basis for delivering meaningful content to users.</p>
<h3>Passing Judgement Carefully</h3>
<p>When judging among various link building services, reading <a href="http://smarterware.org/2019/05/10-best-link-building-services-backlink-building-companies/">various online reviews of different services</a> will at least help in determining one&#8217;s own quality score. But the future&#8217;s biggest threat to today&#8217;s status quo when it comes to bolstering traffic via relevant links is not the offshore link builders in India or even the AI bots, its the search engines.</p>
<p>Building links&#8211;and a business&#8211;with long-term staying power in mind, requires a strict focus on quality&#8211;something bots and foreign solution providers have yet to master. Whether outsourced or in-house, quality written content&#8211;for the foreseeable, immediate future&#8211;will likely remain in the hands of on-shored, human beings.</p>

While IoT is already churning out an enormous volume of data every day, it is only a fraction of what is likely to come up in the next ten years. IoT is the buzzword for market researchers &#8212; and their success.</p>
<p>Virtually everything, from industrial machines to wearable tech to medical devices, generates streams of data continuously. This data is stored, processed, and analyzed to empower different use cases. Going forward, market researchers can leverage big data analytics to gain granular visibility into separate data sets.</p>
<p><strong>This IoT is producing big data that will help in generating useful insights to produce concrete results concerning IoT devices and projects.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Leveraging IoT Trends for Market Research   </strong></h2>
<p>Here are five ways market researchers can use IoT to their advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Cloud Applications. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IoT sensors are internet-enabled, and so they are always sharing and receiving data through cloud technology. As a result of this, IoT has a significant impact on cloud computing, big data, and streaming analytics. With a massive amount of data being exchanged on cloud apps, market researchers can collect the data from major cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure and benefit from it.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>Traditional Industries. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Manufacturers, government organizations, and oil and gas companies are the first to adopt advanced technologies, and they are ones who are leading the IoT revolution. IoT has a much higher acceptance rate in traditional industries that leverage the Internet of Things for monitoring traffic, tracking speed, or detecting pressure drops.</p>
<p>For market researchers, the prominence of IoT in the old school industries is an excellent opportunity to determine future patterns for the application of IoT. When constructing market research, the best way to start is to investigate where and how the existing IoT solutions can be enhanced through intelligence and instrumentation.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>SaaS Companies. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IoT hardware sensors are evoking a lot of interest and being researched, but the software powers the underlying technology, which facilitates the real-time transfer of data. Researchers can study the code so they know what keeps the hardware up and running as it can get overlooked otherwise. Also, with the advent of drones and robots, market researchers will need accurate insights to figure out if buyers are ready to embrace the change.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Qualitative Research Projects.</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Researchers are in their nascent stage of discovering the latest IoT trends, and so they can use qualitative research to understand the role of IoT in different projects. Understanding the role of IoT projects would also help researchers uncover the pain points faced in these projects so they can shed light on unexpected problems and the solutions to cope with them.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Big Tech. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary purpose of IoT is to make data sharing quick and easy, which is why major corporations like Cisco and Microsoft are building secure IoT solutions for different devices. Increasing the focus on security is now a focal point of research for most projects. But, how much does the general public care about safety in their IoT devices? And, does this affect their purchase behavior? It is <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/22/predictive-analytics-how-to-turbocharge-your-digital-marketing-strategy/">questions like these that enable market researchers</a> to determine future business trends.</p>
<h3><strong>The Scope of IoT in 2019 and Beyond</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>IoT will Continue to Stay Hot – in Data and Devices. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Investments in IoT are expected to cross $1 trillion by 2020. Currently, there are about 1.3 billion connections, and IoT services have already reached an inflection point of 18 to 20 percent adoption.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong>5G Networks Will Rollout and Rule. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rollout of 5G networks will impact all the IoT devices that are currently running on low-data-rate networks. With this, all the IoT apps that are linked to automation technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual and augmented reality will enhance their capabilities.</p>
<p>Specific applications like self-driven vehicles and cognitive computing will transition to the next level with the rollout of 5G networks. From <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/01/23/how-iot-has-exposed-business-organizations-to-cyber-attacks/">manufacturing and transportation</a> to public safety and emergency services, every industry will enjoy significant benefits as 5G networks finally become available on the market.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong>IoT Security will Take Center Stage.<br />
</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The increasing use of IoT devices will automatically increase the risk of cyber attacks. From smart phones and home appliances to high-security commercial installations and government applications, everything will become vulnerable to attacks. IoT can also be used to create botnets which hackers can use for cyber attacks on Wi-Fi enabled networks, routers, and IoT devices. For all of these reasons, IoT security will become a top priority.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong>Big Players will Dominate the Market. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Platform vendors like Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft and leading carriers like Vodafone, AT&amp;T, and Verizon will increase their IoT footprint. While these big players battle their IoT market share, much of the market research here will revolve around investigating the launch into a market.</p>
<p>As a result of this, security will become the focal point of research for most projects. Market researchers will be entailed the responsibility of determining the importance of security among buyers and how it will impact their purchase decision. So it will become crucial to have a bigger view.    <strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong>Tapping IoT Talent Will be Challenging. </strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While the demand for IoT has increased dramatically, the <a href="https://readwrite.com/2018/12/21/why-iot-has-consistently-fallen-short-of-predictions/">skill shortage continues</a>. The skill shortage is why more than two-thirds of companies are unable to hire the experts they need for app development and use of IoT. Smaller players that are not up for IoT are focusing on certain types of devices and data movement to solve their specific industry challenges.</p>
<p>2016 was a milestone that marked the importance of IoT across the globe, and this technology has only gained more popularity since then. Businesses across industries have IoT on their radar, and it is already impacting millions of lives.</p>
<p>Different IoT platforms are now facilitating the development of faster, simpler, and intuitive. With apps, the market researchers are undertaking predictive IoT analysis. Meanwhile smart applications and wearable devices have already become top IoT applications.</p>
<p>If we take a look back, the Internet disrupted most industries in 1995; Kodak disappeared with the launch of digital cameras, Encyclopedia lost to Wikipedia, Amazon crushed book stores, and blockbuster was blown off by the Netflix wave. The Internet has changed the way people purchase investment plans, movie tickets, and plane tickets.</p>
<p>Just like the Internet, IoT has triggered a revolution, and with thousands of projects being launched, this trend is here to say, and researchers will have a lot on their checklist for their next project.</p>
<h2><strong>Leveraging the Full Potential of IoT with Market Research Software </strong></h2>
<p>Customers are not that knowledgeable as yet, and so it is the suppliers who need to know the right stuff when making their products and systems. Market researchers can <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/05/10/how-iot-will-change-content-marketing/">conduct interviews with end-users</a> who’ve used IoT systems and learn their triggers for investing in this technology. Market research can also uncover IoT vendors, the pain points of their existing clients.</p>
<p>Then there are the expectations of their potential customers. Companies need to know how the installations went, and also what is driving consumers to invest in IoT devices and products. Market research can also discover what is lacking in IoT products and identify opportunities for making positive changes in the value chain.</p>
<h3>To create the perfect market research surveys, researchers can use <a href="https://surveysparrow.com/market-research/market-research-software/">market research software</a>.</h3>
<p>Market research survey software allows you to create highly engaging online surveys that can be distributed across multiple platforms. A survey generates useful data before launching a new project, for improving an existing product, or for identifying potential new target markets.</p>
<p>Surveys are a surefire way to extract accurate data on virtually anything. With fully-featured market research survey software that comes with ready templates, researchers can have reliable data and detailed analysis in hand. With advanced filters, researchers can generate precise responses.</p>
<p>The advanced filters sift through the data without missing out any crucial piece of information. When this data is employed well, it can turn projects around quickly and moves the data into a powerful marketing tool.</p>

In fact, it’s often just the opposite. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://acceleratethebusiness.clickfunnels.com/sales-page-17452197"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2018 Inside Sales study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 720 sales representatives, the average salesperson spends just 35 percent of her time on revenue-generating activities. What does she do with the remaining two-thirds? Almost all of it — 63 percent of sales reps’ total time — is spent using sales technologies, with email clients claiming the most time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason salespeople spend that much time with sales tools becomes obvious when you consider their tool set. The </span><a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2017/06/average-enterprise-uses-91-marketing-cloud-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average enterprise uses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 43 cloud-based CRM or sales tools and a whopping 91 marketing tools. Look a little deeper, though, and you’ll notice something: Top-performing enterprises tend to use far fewer. Microsoft, for instance, uses </span><a href="http://cdn.chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/microsoft_martech_stack.png"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 40 tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its sales and marketing stack; Cisco </span><a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2017/04/cisco-shares-marketing-stack-39-marketing-technologies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses 39</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><b>Slim Down Your Stack</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importing, exporting, and toggling between sales and marketing tools takes more time than many leaders realize. To consolidate your sales and marketing stack:</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Make the most of your foundation with workflow automation.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and most critical choice you’ll make when paring down your sales and marketing tool kit? Which tool will be your “home.” At most companies, this will be a CRM. Because CRMs store customer data and track touchpoints, they tend to be the most time-consuming part of a sales stack to swap out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve settled on your foundation, try to accomplish as much within it as possible. Salesforce users, for instance, don’t need a separate suite to manage their drip email campaigns. </span><a href="https://mixmax.com/workflow-automation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workflow automation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with an integrative tool like Mixmax can help users get the most out of their CRM foundation; salespeople, for example, can book meetings, automate follow-ups, and save time logging information with the right integrative tool. Automation can also help prevent the human error of a missed connection that could lead to lost deals. Workflow automation software ensures salespeople always send effective emails to the right people at the right time, schedule more meaningful meetings, and keep CRM data updated.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Give up on “shelfware.”</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve determined what you definitely want to keep, your next step is to identify tools that you definitely don’t. If you’re not sure, ask your team which tools they haven’t used in a month or more. Rather than push people to start using them, accept that they aren’t part of your team’s workflow. According to a Flexera study, </span><a href="https://www.flexera.com/company/news/press-releases/despite-stagnant-enterprise-software-budgets-waste-is-running-rampant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">93 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of enterprise companies struggle with so-called “shelfware,” or purchased software products that rarely or never get used. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does shelfware happen, and where should you look? Product innovations are a big cause. A company that now sells an online service instead of a physical product, for instance, probably doesn’t need point-of-sale software any longer. Another is canceled initiatives. If your company tried and moved on from experiential marketing, it may still be paying for pricey tools like Limelight or MainEvent. Others may simply be the result of miscommunications or role transitions, such as a CRM system that was purchased by mistake or abandoned after a prior leader left the company. </span></p>
<h3><b>3. Use “need” statements to spot overlaps. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The toughest part of slimming down a sales stack is identifying tools that see use but still aren’t necessary. These redundancies, to be fair, often occur after a tool is originally purchased. Because cloud software products are updated regularly and without some users’ knowledge, they often grow into areas that are already covered by another tool in the company’s stack. To find overlaps between them, jot down what each application can do and compare them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, a friend of mine who’s a sales director used Anaplan for territory planning. To its credit, Anaplan makes it easy to assign territories, forecast revenue per territory, and ensure complete coverage. But my friend was also using Salesforce, which includes a </span><a href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=forecasts3_territory_forecasts_overview.htm&amp;type=5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">territory forecasting tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not only can Salesforce’s tool do those same things, but it also displays “child” territories, forecasts product family revenue in each territory, and drills down to individual representatives’ forecasts if a given territory doesn’t have an assigned salesperson. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><b></b></p>
<h3><b>4. Don’t compromise when it comes to data.  </b><b><br />
</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you always get rid of a tool that accomplishes the same thing as one you like more? Not necessarily. There&#8217;s one case when it might make sense to use a companion tool — or even swap out your “hub” system: additional relevant data feeds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say you do most of your sales at trade shows. Well, Zoho may be a minor player in the CRM space, but it easily captures data from a couple of places that most of its peers don’t: </span><a href="https://www.zoho.com/crm/features.html?src=multi_channel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trade show documents and live chat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even if your team spends just a few hours a week entering trade show touchpoints into your CRM, it might make sense to switch. It doesn’t take many weeks for the hours your team saves through automated data entry to make up for the time cost of switching. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which sales and marketing tools are “right” for your company is a question with no easy answer. Which sales candidates are right for your team? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it time to expand into new territory? As with those topics, bigger and broader isn’t always better. Sometimes, sticking with tried-and-true performers while saying “no” to the rest really is the best strategy. </span></p>

Live streaming has made that communication two-way. Businesses can talk to an audience, and that audience can use the comments to interact with the broadcaster. There are three top tools to broadcast to Facebook Live.</p>
<h2>A broadcaster on Facebook can ask questions, they can show their approval, and they can even chat with other viewers.</h2>
<p>A cosmetics seller could broadcast a live demonstration while viewers ask questions about specific skin types, and other viewers describe their own experiences. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/02/21/you-have-a-great-tech-idea-now-what/">Selling in this way</a> is a very different and very effective way of marketing.</p>
<p><a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/05/19/what-to-expect-from-a-modern-iot-platform-in-2019/">Platforms</a> such as <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/02/26/thanks-tech-for-strategic-advantage-on-tv/">Facebook make the process simple</a> enough, but several third-party providers have now added to those services. Facebook’s platform and made it even more compelling for companies that want to engage and sell. Leading the way is <a href="http://belive.tv">BeLive</a>. This service integrates with Facebook to enable broadcasters to conduct split-screen interviews.</p>
<p>So you could talk to another expert in your field, and your audience would see both of you on the screen, just like a news broadcast. You can even create a kind of talk show that puts as many as four people on the screen at the same time, with ten waiting on a type of lobby to join the conversation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best feature offered by BeLive is branding and communication. The platform lets broadcasters use their own logos, frames, and colors, and create chyrons. So as you’re answering a viewer’s question, an assistant could put that question on the screen or pick out the best comments flowing alongside the video. It’s all you need to make the broadcast effective.</p>
<p><a href="http://ecamm.com">Ecamm</a> is aimed at Mac users and has similar functions. You can add overlays to live broadcasts, share your Mac desktop (which is useful for software demos and tutorials), and switch between different camera views. That sounds useful, but it risks being disorienting for viewers, and it might even be too professional.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of live video is that it brings viewers close to a brand. They can feel like they’re talking <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/09/6-tips-to-automate-your-marketing/">directly to a business</a> or an expert in the same way they might Facetime a friend. Switching between camera views might give a broadcast the slickness of a shopping channel broadcast but at the expense of intimacy.</p>
<p>The green screen feature that lets you change your background does have the potential for lots of fun, though. Finally, <a href="http://crowdcast.io">Crowdcast</a> is a bit simpler. It puts a lot of emphasis on its fast onboarding. The platform has a straightforward setup, with no downloads.</p>
<p>Facebook Live is very simple. It’s the extra features that you’re looking for from a third party. Where Crowdcast does offer some benefits is in its engagement features—the platform provides polls and interactive Q&amp;As—and in its stats data.</p>
<p>You can track<a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/03/05/iot-and-the-transformation-of-the-modern-workplace/"> performance with advanced analytics,</a> and also connect with Zapier. So you could, for example, set up an automated response to someone who clicks a link placed in the comments. The platform is particularly popular with users of Patreon who use it to drum up support for their fundraising and answer questions from potential donors.</p>
<p>Facebook Live is powerful by itself. But the social media site has left plenty of room for other businesses to add features and get even more benefits out of live broadcasting. Whether you’re focused on interviews and answering questions, want to turn your Mac into a television control room, or want to give a Patreon campaign a bit of a boost, Facebook Live and its third party support will help you meet your goals.</p>

While good sales reps remain dedicated to hitting their company’s goals, the chance for employee burnout while doing so is high. There are seven strategies that boost sales productivity.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;ll need strategies that boost sales productivity, as competitors will always be looking to swipe your prospects.</h2>
<p>Fortunately, sales reps are naturally competitive individuals driven by a desire to win, increase personal excellence, and be their company’s top performer. It falls on sales operations to find the right <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/04/26/3-ways-deep-learning-can-help-your-sales-team-thrive/">tools and processes</a> to enable those sales reps to maintain that edge and continue <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/02/20/5-emerging-technologies-that-can-help-increase-sales-conversions/">hitting their targets</a>.</p>
<p>The following are seven practical tools and strategies sales reps can use to help their reps work more efficiently without feeling the burnout. Ultimately, well-planned strategy will boost productivity and drive your company revenue.</p>
<h3><strong>Clean and Actionable Sales Performance Management (SPM) Data</strong></h3>
<p>Data must be usable. There is a lot of SPM data everywhere, but until it’s clean, organized, and centralized, it is nothing more than a lot of names and numbers. Ironically, sales data contains some of a business’ most valuable information.</p>
<p>This SPM data will provide critical insights into the all-important, but often elusive, customer journey. Much of the sales data has gone unmanaged, and CRM data has taken priority. This does a disservice to organizations since CRM data is subjective and dependent on sales and marketing people to update it.</p>
<p>Sadly, both the sales and marketing departments have been responsible for procuring information and adding updates. The habit of having departments with somewhat unique goals &#8212; leave inaccurate information in the file. We now have the most erroneous data source in the archives.</p>
<h4>Companies with large salesforces in highly competitive markets are starting to understand that the data unlocked by their sales performance management (SPM) systems.</h4>
<p>Your SPM system might hold the keys to the kingdom for your company. The most advanced SPM platforms will already have the capability to pull data in from almost any source in a matter of hours (not days). Use this accurate data accessible to help sales leaders readily identify geographies with ease.</p>
<h4>Note how quickly you see the potential for business growth and cross-selling productivity opportunities.</h4>
<p>Combine accessible, accurate data and no-code application development capabilities. That enables quick development of focused reports; sales leaders can quickly and easily activate that data and provide sales reps instant access to the key insights that will help them achieve their goals quickly and efficiently.</p>
<h3><strong>No-Code Apps </strong></h3>
<p>Fast and actionable data is crucial for salespeople to close deals quickly. It’s essential for sales people to promptly analyze actionable insights to make more informed and impactful decisions. <a href="https://readwrite.com/2018/09/27/how-ai-will-help-sales-representatives/">Sales reps</a> will focus on the right opportunities using no-code data management tools.</p>
<h4>Gaining instant access to information about customers and prospects in a timely and efficient manner is the key to boost sales.</h4>
<p>No-code applications enable sales to validate and pre-process data via <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/06/10/beyond-remote-security-6-smarter-uses-for-your-vpn/">no-code extract,</a> transform, and load (ETL) capabilities. These capabilities allow the data to be consolidated and organized without sales having to work with additional third-party tools or write complicated code.</p>
<p>Automating the time-consuming code writing process enables sales to pull aggregated data in a matter of minutes. You&#8217;ll give your salespeople more time to do what they do best quickly and efficiently – sell.</p>
<h3><strong>Real-Time Performance Metrics</strong></h3>
<p>In order to help sales reps succeed and achieve professional satisfaction, they must have visibility into their performance metrics. How many calls are they making? How many meetings have they scheduled? How many deals are they closing?</p>
<p>The data shared through SPM data provides sales with this valuable information, allowing them to measure their own performance. Salespeople can see where they want to pick up the pace to close more deals.</p>
<h3><strong>Sales Pipeline Analysis </strong></h3>
<p>Sales must perform ongoing analysis of its sales pipeline – tracking opportunities from the first contact to a closed sale. Sales pipeline analysis enables the transactions data to monitor the unfolding sales process and reveal which areas have the potential for improvement.</p>
<p>Analyzing the data helps reps achieve their objectives by allowing them to make accurate forecasts based on the number and quality of <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/03/02/the-real-key-metrics-and-magic-numbers-behind-successful-b2b-sales-outreach/">leads in the sales pipeline</a>. To perform this analysis successfully and to achieve the desired results, sales reps need to identify the pipeline stages in the <a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/07/24/is-there-any-stopping-techs-big-four-from-monopolizing-user-data/">particular selling process.</a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see the number of deals in the pipeline, the average sales cycle, win rates, average deal sizes, and even the stagnant opportunities. These stages should flow logically, smoothly leading prospects from one step to the next, all the way to closing the sale.</p>
<h3><strong>Mobile Alerts and Accessibility </strong></h3>
<p>Mobile apps are geared toward the always-on-the-go sales rep. They ensure reps get instant access to crucial information about clients and prospects. You&#8217;ll facilitate collaboration and communication with managers and colleagues. By using mobile apps to visualize and act upon real-time business metrics, sales reps are empowered to exceed across individual and team goals.</p>
<p>Additionally, mobile productivity calculators allow sales reps to gauge their own performance against their coworkers wherever they might be, providing clear, concise “need-to-know” intel that helps them reach their next sales goal quickly.</p>
<h3><strong>Gamification</strong></h3>
<p>The use of mobile apps has also spurred on greater interest in gamification, which is a great tool that resonates well with competitive sales reps who want to win and be recognized for their efforts. With things like leaderboards, gamification naturally taps into this competitive nature. Allow reps to see how they are performing against their colleagues. Gamification can also be used for administrative tasks, like filling out forms and updating sales data. Giving sales recognition for doing these tasks may seem trivial, but it keeps them motivated.</p>
<h3><strong>Communication</strong></h3>
<p>Sales reps want to know how they are performing at all times. As a result, many organizations are increasingly utilizing technology to support those on the frontline.</p>
<p>Digital platforms that combine messaging capabilities with incentive compensation systems enable sales operations to inform sales reps. The sales rep needs information about comp plan changes, territories, contests, and other vital matters that affect the quality of their performance.</p>
<p>This includes clear communication of targets and goals, ways to close more deals quickly. The reps will learn how to strengthen relationships with customers and turn repeat customers into champions for the organization. Also, sales ops have robust reporting analytics to coach their sales reps in these matters effectively.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Sales reps work hard to earn their compensation year-round. Your reps should be equipped with the tools and strategies that help them hit their quotas, and close those long-lead sales more quickly and efficiently. By using strategic tools that enable them to sell more effectively, sales reps can work more efficiently during the day and hit their organization’s goals, all without feeling the burn.</p>

As internet, mobile, and IoT technologies become more pervasive, the vulnerable points that hackers can target have increased. Companies can&#8217;t simply patch these vulnerabilities and relax. </span><a href="https://readwrite.com/2019/02/28/3-high-tech-ways-companies-are-fighting-cybercrime-right-now/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybercrime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a constantly evolving threat, and your strategy needs to continually adapt to the latest dangers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first half of the year provided object lessons in how imminent these threats are. Since January, we’ve seen data privacy breaches at </span><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/23/perceptics_hacked_license_plate_recognition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and increasing incidents of </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/lockergoga-ransomware-crippling-industrial-firms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransomware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targeting industrial firms. One of the most serious cybersecurity incidents of the year didn’t even require hackers. In May, it was revealed that First American, a real estate and title insurance firm, had </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/biggest-cybersecurity-crises-2019-so-far/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">885 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customer financial records publicly available on its website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from violating customers’ trust, these events are costly — customer data has become a commodity in its own right. Although some breaches feel inevitable, best practices can limit the damage significantly. The New York Times</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that handling cybersecurity the right way — including encrypting data properly and employing a well-trained staff — can reduce the costs of a breach by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/business/dealbook/corporate-america-cybersecurity.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">47%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>3 Steps to Fight Cybercrime Into Next Year</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity is just one component of your data and technology mission. Providing an engaging user experience, empowering your employees, and complying with data regulations are also critical. But without robust security, all that is built on a house of cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to be a cyber-savvy leader, learn from the first half of 2019 as you revamp your cybersecurity efforts.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Harden remote access.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to business technology, remote access is a blessing and a curse. It allows remote workers and vendors to access the systems they need to do their jobs, but it also opens the door to cybercriminals. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/do-remote-workers-increase-your-chance-of-a-data-breach-86-of-cxos-say-yes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">86%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of executives think data is more at risk when employees work remotely. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce that risk. The key is having employees work on your secure network, no matter where they&#8217;re physically working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of your best options is to use virtual private networks (VPNs), which enable employees to stay off public networks. Another approach is to provide more personalized access through a privileged access management (PAM) solution rather than a VPN. A PAM system gives you more detailed or specific control. In comparison, a VPN is essentially all-or-nothing access for your team. For instance, a PAM solution makes it possible to cut off access to terminated employees or set up alerts and session tracking. Decide how many different levels of access you need internally to determine which of these two routes is best.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Prioritize IoT security.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the IoT explodes, hackers are targeting these devices and their systems. It’s often too late to patch a device after a security vulnerability has been discovered. For that reason, Trend Micro is pitching in to help companies get it right before IoT devices go to market with its </span><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero Day Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides a team of researchers to vet IoT devices submitted from manufacturers. Efforts like this help ensure that the IoT devices you implement aren’t making it easier for hackers to access your systems and data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To further harden IoT offerings, implement two-factor authentications for network access, in which an SMS code or other means to verify the device is used. As Heitor Faroni, director of solutions marketing for the Network Business Division at Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise,</span> <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3276304/building-iot-ready-networks-must-become-a-priority.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Many IoT devices are not designed with security in mind and consequently have little to no integrated security capabilities. The best way is to minimize the risks is to take a multi-layer security approach. It starts at the user and device level, making sure that every user and device is recognized, authenticated, and authorized.” Two-factor authentication will help keep hackers off your network.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><b>3. Surpass compliance standards.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data privacy regulations, such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), are a step in the right direction for cybersecurity. Adhering to the letter of these laws — or even surpassing them — can go a long way toward fulfilling your mission. “Going above and beyond what the regulations require ensures that data is protected — and can be a powerful driver of performance,” </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/06/21/four-keys-to-making-compliance-exciting-not-onerous/#239c88964f9e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Wagner, president and CEO of Zix, a leader in email security. “The key is to make the compliance part easy so that companies can focus on turning new regulations into opportunities to discover new strengths.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by collecting information on your operations, documenting carefully how you process data and any vulnerabilities. Such a record is a requirement of the GDPR, so it’s both a smart idea and a necessary step. And separate your compliance and security teams. Sure, both teams are working toward the same end goal, but they&#8217;ll take different actions to work toward that goal. Your compliance team should focus on documentation to show that you’re following compliance regulations. Meanwhile, your security team should focus on any efforts that enhance the security of your company’s systems and private information.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To fend off ever-increasing cybersecurity threats, make sure your company applies the latest patches, fortifies its networks, takes IoT concerns seriously, and complies with all privacy regulations. Companies that fail to do so are courting disaster in the form of brand-damaging breaches, fines, lawsuits, and more. Fortunately, with the array of tools and knowledge available, it’s possible to make your operations much more secure.</span></p>
