								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://blog.doordash.com/combining-two-great-companies-doordash-to-acquire-caviar-9c427721f775">has reached an agreement</a> with Square to purchase on-demand food delivery and catering business Caviar. DoorDash has agreed to pay <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/square" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="square">Square <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> $410 million in cash and preferred DoorDash stock.</p>
<p>Square <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/04/its-official-square-acquires-food-delivery-service-caviar/">bought Caviar about five years ago in a deal worth about $90 million</a>. Now, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/caviar" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="caviar">Caviar <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has found a new home with DoorDash, the on-demand delivery startup that had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/doordash-double-downs-on-controversial-pay-model/">under fire for months</a> regarding how it pays its delivery workers. DoorDash finally did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/doordash-changes-tipping/">right by its workers just last week</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s announcement is another important step forward on our mission to empower local economies,&#8221; DoorDash CEO Tony Xu (pictured above) said in a statement. &#8220;We have long-admired Caviar, which has a coveted brand, an exceptional portfolio of premium restaurants and leading technology. The acquisition further enhances the breadth of our merchant selection, enabling us to offer customers even more choice when they order through DoorDash. We look forward to welcoming the Caviar team to DoorDash and expanding our partnership with Square in the future.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re thrilled to welcome Caviar to the family, and to work together towards our shared vision of empowering local economies. <a href="https://t.co/MGCGYdVhvT">https://t.co/MGCGYdVhvT</a></p>
<p>&mdash; DoorDash (@DoorDash) <a href="https://twitter.com/DoorDash/status/1157020712462274560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With Caviar joining DoorDash, Square&#8217;s Caviar lead, Gokul Rajaram, along with all the other Caviar employees will join DoorDash once the acquisition closes. The deal is expected to close sometime this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caviar has built a trusted brand with customers and many of the best restaurants,&#8221; Rajaram said in a statement. &#8220;DoorDash has national scale, complementary restaurant selection, a tremendous logistics platform, and a team that shares our passion and commitment to better serve restaurants, couriers, and customers. I’m incredibly excited to be joining, with the rest of the Caviar team, to help build the future of local commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Square, this deal provides the company with an opportunity to focus more on its products for businesses and individuals, Square CEO Jack Dorsey said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are increasing our focus on and investment in our two large, growing ecosystems &#8212; one for businesses and one for individuals,&#8221; Dorsey said. &#8220;This transaction furthers that effort, and we believe partnering with DoorDash provides valuable and strategic opportunities for Square.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting this isn&#8217;t the first time Square has tried to rid itself of Caviar. In 2016, Bloomberg reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-11/square-said-to-have-discussed-caviar-sale-with-uber-grubhub">Square was wanting to sell Caviar for $100 million but couldn&#8217;t find a buyer</a>. At the time, Square was reportedly in talks with Uber, GrubHub and Yelp due to Caviar&#8217;s excessive losses. Square, however, does not break out specific Caviar earnings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Square just reported its Q2 2019 earnings with net revenues of $1.17 billion (44% y/o/y growth), adjusted revenues of $563 million (46% y/o/y growth) and a net loss of $7 million. In Square&#8217;s letter to shareholders, the company described how there will now be more clarity regarding how the company operates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore, DoorDash is already integrated with Square for Restaurants, which streamlines the acceptance of online and in-person orders for merchants, and in the second quarter Cash Boost partnered with DoorDash to provide instant rewards when customers use their Cash Card at DoorDash. We believe continuing this partnership provides valuable and strategic opportunities for Square.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big players in the on-demand food delivery space are now DoorDash/Caviar, Postmates, UberEats and GrubHub/Seamless. In May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/doordash-now-valued-at-12-6b-shoots-for-the-moon/">DoorDash raised a $400 million round valuing</a> it at $12.6 billion. Postmates, easily now one of DoorDash&#8217;s prime competitors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/food-delivery-service-postmates-confidentially-files-to-go-public/">is currently worth about $1.85 billion and confidentially filed to go public earlier this year</a>. Though, that IPO has yet to happen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are a lot of ugly fonts out there, but outside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/papyrus-creator-speaks-out-after-ryan-gosling-roasts-the-font-on-snl/">Papyrus</a>, few illustrate a deeper sickness in our society. A new typeface called Ugly Gerry does just that: Its letters are formed from the shapes of grotesquely gerrymandered U.S. districts.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt gerrymandering is one of the scourges of our political &#8220;system&#8221;: nothing more than a way for incumbents to stack the odds in their favor, further disenfranchising and redlining disfavored populations and districts.</p>
<p>And while districts may take many shapes due to the natural features of the cities and regions they occupy or contain, in many contentious ones the hand of the man is more than evident, producing contortions weird and various.</p>
<p>The bright side is that this variety is so great that among it can be found shapes resembling (slightly) all the capital letters of the English alphabet. So that&#8217;s just what rogue creatives Ben Doessel and James Lee did.</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1863559" title="Screen Shot 2019-08-01 at 11.52.55 AM" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-11.52.55-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 08 01 at 11.52.55 AM" width="1024" height="618" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-11.52.55-AM.png 1240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-11.52.55-AM.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-11.52.55-AM.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-11.52.55-AM.png?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-11.52.55-AM.png?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-11.52.55-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;After seeing how janky our Illinois 4th district had become, we became interested in this issue,&#8221; the team wrote in a little press release they provided. &#8220;We noticed our district’s vague, but shaky U-shape, then after seeing other letters on the map, the idea hit us, let’s create a typeface so our districts can become digital graffiti that voters and politicians can’t ignore.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resulting type is ugly, but so, they point out, is gerrymandering. They also had to cheat a few by sticking two districts together, but that too seems in the spirit of the thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://uglygerry.com">You can download the font for free at UglyGerry.com</a>.</p>
<p>While I suspect that Doessel and Lee have underestimated politicians&#8217; ability to ignore things, it&#8217;s good to draw attention to this un-democratic practice, and you&#8217;re encouraged (as with most things) to tweet. Of course the very best thing you can do is call your representatives and officials and register your protest against gerrymandering in general, and to vote if possible to limit or outlaw it.</p>
<p>Today, tweeting about a novelty font&#8230; tomorrow, action! That&#8217;s the idea, anyway.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The recently reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/capital-one-hacked-over-100-million-customers-affected/">Capital One data breach</a> has once again turned the technology world’s attention to cloud security. A lot of speculation is all that the industry can surmise about exactly what happened and how the events came to pass. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/seattle-tech-worker-arrested-data-theft-involving-large-financial-services-company">indictment</a> is vague and the companies are in PR crisis mode.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not waste this time on conjecture. It&#8217;s important to focus on the uncomfortable yet completely valid cloud security concerns while everyone is listening.</p>
<p>The elephant in the room in cloud platform security is the inherently problematic issue of customers not knowing which cloud provider employees are entrusted with administrative-level access to the clouds themselves. <em>Cloud Customer X</em> does not know the names of employees at <em>Cloud Provider Y</em> who, upon succumbing to moral failing, could theoretically abuse privileged knowledge, credentials, or internal cloud provider tools in order to inappropriately access, copy, or otherwise interact with <em>Cloud Customer X</em>’s provisioned systems or stored data.</p>
<p>To be clear, there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/capital-one-breach-was-inevitable/">no suggestion</a> that the Capital One breach is the result of insider access or privileged knowledge abuse. While the alleged perpetrator&#8217;s prior work history includes employment at Amazon Web Services — the cloud provider which data was downloaded from — the amount of cloud service know-how necessary to pull off the alleged wrongful acts can certainly be gained by anyone with an internet connection and enough curiosity.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to talk about cloud platform security in a broader sense. We need to make sure when executives sign on the dotted line and agree to put mountains of their own customer data under someone else’s control that they understand the stark trade-off realities, rather than the myths, of cloud platform security.</p>
<p>Simply put, moving operations into the cloudspace means you are putting yourself at the mercy of the cloud host. Ultimately, the cloud provider can take their ball and go home, leaving your business stranded. Doing so might be in violation of some words that an attorney typed up and both sides agreed to. But those words cannot physically stop a cloud provider’s rogue subcontractor from abusing trusted access — of which the cloud customer would most likely never know.</p>
<p>There are no easy fixes for such a scenario. But it would be foolish to wait for egregious examples of cloud platform insider abuse to be known publicly prior to sparking the very important conversation, even if the topic is uncomfortable for cloud providers to acknowledge and unsettling for cloud users to realize.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest bout in Las Vegas is not taking place in a raucous casino boxing ring, but in the hushed rooms of planning committees. The reigning champion, the Las Vegas Monorail, is facing upstart challenger The Boring Company, in a fight to decide the future of Sin City’s urban transportation.</p>
<p>In May, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority approved <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/elon-musks-boring-company-lands-48-7m-contract-for-underground-people-mover-in-las-vegas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $48.7 million contract</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for The Boring Company (TBC) to design and build a short underground transit system at the city’s Convention Center, using Tesla electric vehicles running through narrow tunnels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambitious contract calls for the system, called the LVCC Loop, to be up and running in time for the city’s biggest trade show, CES, in January 2021. Over the next 18 months, TBC has to construct one pedestrian tunnel, two 0.8-mile vehicle tunnels and three underground stations, as well as modify and test seven-seater Tesla cars to carry up to 16 people. </span></p>
<p>TBC has already submitted detailed construction plans to the city for review, which TechCrunch has obtained, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/elon-musks-boring-company-snags-120-million-in-new-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently raised $120 million in funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company hopes to start construction later this summer. </span></p>
<p>But TBC’s tight deadlines — and the payments it receives by meeting them — could be jeopardized by the Monorail’s concerns that the new tunnels could undermine its own system. To connect two parts of the Convention Center, the Loop will have to burrow directly beneath the Monorail’s elevated tracks.</p>
<h2>Fear of Monorail damage</h2>
<p>“The proposed underground people mover system intersects our existing system route, and it appears the presented tunnel alignment interferes with our existing columns for the Las Vegas Monorail system and creates significant concern regarding both vertical and lateral loads,” Monorail CEO Curtis Myles wrote in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6225032-19-0429-2019-6-25-Monorail-Concerns.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter to Clark County planning officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in June.</span></p>
<p>Chris Kaempfer, a lawyer representing the Monorail, clarified the company’s position at a meeting of the Winchester Town Advisory Board the same day.</p>
<p>“When you have columns that would be this close, you’re not just concerned about contact with the columns, you’re also concerned about vibration,” Kaempfer said. “The record has to be absolutely clear, if there’s any damage at all to the columns, it will shut the Monorail down.”</p>
<p>Kaempfer lobbied the advisory board to increase oversight of the TBC project, and require the company to work with the Monorail and city officials during construction to prevent damage to the train system&#8217;s columns.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely important to the Monorail that everyone acknowledge that this potential exists and that it needs to be appropriately addressed,” Kaempfer said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TBC pushed back against any new restrictions, telling the board that it was already committed to protecting existing infrastructure along the Loop’s route.</span></p>
<p>“[Tunneling] noise and vibration are imperceptible at the surface. We design our process to be deep enough underground such that a person walking [at ground level] creates more vibration than our tunnel-boring machine underground,” said Jane Labanowski, TBC’s government relations executive.</p>
<p>At the final bell, the Winchester Town Board awarded this round to the Monorail, conditioning the Loop design’s approval on regular coordination between TBC, the Monorail and the city’s Public Works department. “That way we all have a point of reference to go back to, just in case somebody forgets or doesn’t check in with other people,” said the chairperson. “All of a sudden, someone gets to be a bad actor who doesn’t mean to be.”</p>
<p>TBC did not respond to requests for comment for this story.</p>
<p>While the Monorail and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/elon-musk" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="elon-musk">Elon Musk’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Loop don’t yet compete directly, TBC’s ultimate ambition is to expand the LVCC Loop from a campus people mover to a <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/lvcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vegas-wide transit system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serving the airport, the Strip and beyond. </span></p>
<p>The Monorail itself started as a short, one-mile system shuttling tourists between the MGM Grand and Bally’s Hotel, using monorail cars bought from Disney World in Florida. It now extends nearly four miles and carries <a href="https://www.lvmonorail.com/operations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to 67,000 passengers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a day during its busiest times.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1863465" style="width: 3701px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1863465" class="breakout wp-image-1863465 size-full" title="The Consumer Electroncs Show in Las Vegas" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg" alt="GettyImages 638158464" width="3691" height="2502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg 3691w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg?resize=768,521 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg?resize=680,461 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-638158464.jpeg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3691px) 100vw, 3691px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1863465" class="wp-caption-text">The Las Vegas Monorail crosses over the Las Vegas Convention Center as viewed on January 4, 2017 in Las Vegas.</p></div></p>
<p>TBC has promised that the Loop will be able to handle up to 4,400 passengers an hour — equivalent to more than 100,000 a day — as soon as it becomes operational. Its website states that the total journey time between the farthest LVCC stations will be around one minute. This means that the Loop will need at least six 16-person vehicles operating simultaneously to hit its goal. However, a one-minute journey might not be realistic at busy times. New York and Boston subway trains regularly stop for more than 30 seconds at popular stations.</p>
<h2>Human drivers will pilot Loop Teslas</h2>
<p>At the Winchester meeting, Labanowski also revealed further details about the Loop’s vehicles and operations. Although TBC’s website states that the system would use autonomous vehicles, presumably using <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Autopilot technology, Labanowski said the LVCC Loop vehicles would actually also have human drivers “for additional safety.”</p>
<p>Loop plans submitted by TBC to Las Vegas show a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6225033-19-0429-2019-7-8-Revised-Plan-and-Photo-VERY-GOOD.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">modest glass structure at surface level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with elevators, escalators and stairs leading down to a mezzanine level with gates, and then down again to three platforms. With </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6225034-19-0429-Detailed-Plans-EXCELLENT.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no room at the platform level for vehicles to turn around</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it appears TBC’s people movers will operate in both forward and reverse.</span></p>
<p>And although TBC hopes its Loop system will eventually span the city, a TBC contractor at the Winchester meeting said that public access could be limited for now. “We will monitor how it’s open to the public based on our commitment to our trade show customers on any given day,” said Terry Miller of the Cordell Corporation, which has been awarded a $1 million contract to oversee the project. “During CES it will be a little more difficult to have the public coming in and out than it would be for a [smaller] trade show.”</p>
<p>The next challenge for TBC is getting all the necessary permits to excavate a shaft to deploy its tunnel-boring machine underground. Its schedule calls for construction to begin in September.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tyler &#8220;Ninja&#8221; Blevins, the biggest streamer ever, has today announced his intention to leave the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitch">Twitch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> platform in favor of Microsoft&#8217;s Mixer.</p>
<p>Twitch is far and away the biggest video game streaming platform on the internet, claiming 72% of all hours watched, according to <a href="https://blog.streamelements.com/state-of-the-stream-q2-2019-facebook-gaming-growth-gta-v-surges-and-twitch-influencers-get-more-529ee67f1b7e">StreamElements</a>. Mixer, by comparison, owns 3%, which is approximately 112 million viewership hours this most recent quarter.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/beam-10" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="beam-10">Mixer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is owned by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> following an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/microsoft-acquires-beam-interactive-game-livestreaming-service/">acquisition in 2016</a>, back when Mixer was called Beam. Interestingly enough, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/eyeclick" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="eyeclick">Beam <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> won the Disrupt NY Battlefield competition in 2016.</p>
<p>Twitch offered this statement to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement">Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve loved watching Ninja on Twitch over the years and are proud of all that he’s accomplished for himself and his family, and the gaming community. We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly quickly, Twitch took away Ninja&#8217;s &#8220;Partnered&#8221; check mark, the Twitch equivalent of a verified blue tick.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Ninja announced the news via video:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LK06xdtxCbY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The announcement is very light on reasons why Ninja might have moved from his longtime home at Twitch over to Microsoft. It&#8217;s possible (and likely?) that Mixer offered the streaming star an enormous amount of money to make the move, which could signal the beginning of a new wave of payouts for mega streaming stars — not unlike the current NBA free agency bonanza, which has seen the migration of superstars to marquee franchises in order to form basketball equivalents of supergroups.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth wondering who reigns supreme in this equation: players or platforms? Luckily, we&#8217;ll find out quickly as the video game streaming space sees its biggest talent shakeup since the industry&#8217;s inception.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Google today highlighted <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/tap-your-phone-get-help-emergency/">a new feature</a> that will bring voice-free emergency service interaction to Pixels and other Android devices. Designed for instances of injury, situations where speaking can present a danger and for users with speech impairments, the feature allows callers to communicate via touch menus. </span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Once an emergency call is triggered, users can specify its nature by tapping “Fire,” “Medical” or “Police.” That information is passed along to an operator without requiring the caller to speak, alongside location information that pulls from the phone’s GPS and uses plus code, a method for locating callers without a specific address.</p>
<p><img class="vertical alignnone size-full wp-image-1863529" title="AED-Lower-Speech-Rate-06" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AED-Lower-Speech-Rate-06.gif" alt="AED Lower Speech Rate 06" width="720" height="1519" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The menu information is stored locally on the phone, and all of the information shared remains confidential, shared only with the emergency operator. Once the information is entered, users can also speak directly to the operator if able. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The feature was created in collaboration with the National Emergency Number Association. It’s arriving on Pixel phones and select Android devices in the U.S. in the coming months. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“I don&#8217;t want more success. I don&#8217;t want more money.” When most hedge fund managers say something like that to you, you’d be justified in suspecting that they’re giving you their carefully crafted Davos riff.</p>
<p>Because unlike many Silicon Valley billionaires who believe (or sort of believe) in the transcendence of their mission, the motives of the Wall Street titan are often straightforward: it’s about the money, and when the money gets huge, it’s about building a legacy.</p>
<p>But as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ray-dalio" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ray-dalio">Ray Dalio <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> looked me in the eyes recently and said those words, I believed in his sincerity. That’s not to say he won’t earn enormous sums more. In fact, last year, the financial press widely reported that Dalio earned in the ten figures thanks to Bridgewater’s flagship Pure Alpha fund posting stellar returns.</p>
<p>But when you spend some time with Dalio and broach the various topics in which he has rarefied expertise, it’s apparent that today, the world’s most famous hedge funder could care less about ascending the ranks of the world’s megarich or in achieving more glory or praise for himself.</p>
<p>Although Dalio has diverse philanthropic interests, he retains a very hands-on role as co-CIO of Bridgewater, where he cuts an imposing figure as a guy with little time for inefficiency or nonsense. But he also wears his heart on his sleeve as he seeks to spread the word about principles-based decision-making and the coming paradigm shift that he says will have a dramatic impact on our economy and the markets.</p>

Dalio is the founder of investment firm Bridgewater Associates, one of the world&#8217;s largest hedge funds.

<h2><b>The gospel of hyperrealism</b></h2>
<p>By adhering to the twin pillars of radical transparency and radical truth-telling, Dalio believes that the idea meritocracy that powers Bridgewater can be replicated by the home-gamer. Are some of the specific principles that Bridgewater abides by controversial and harsh (e.g., Beware of the impractical idealist, Don’t expect people to recognize and compensate for their own blind spots, Use “public hangings” to deter bad behavior)? Yes. Does he care if you don’t buy into them? Not really:</p>

Its programmers likely didn&#8217;t imagine they were designing a chess program to take on the best players in the world, however: U.S. No. 1 ranked chess player Fabiano Caruana (also currently ranked No. 2 in the world) played a Tesla Model 3 in a recent match&#8230; but Deep Blue versus Kasparov, this was not.</p>
<p>Caruana bests the vehicle in just under five minutes of playing time, and he&#8217;s not particularly stressing the time, plus he&#8217;s offering a running commentary. The car makes some questionable moves, but to be fair, it&#8217;s not a super computer with deep artificial intelligence, and Caruana is one of the world&#8217;s best. He also gives it credit at the end, calling the game &#8220;challenging&#8221; and you can hear it&#8217;s probably more than he was expecting from a car&#8217;s infotainment system.</p>
<p>The car would probably beat me, but I&#8217;m unranked and haven&#8217;t played a game of chess in probably 15 years, so there&#8217;s that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch">Extra Crunch</a>, TechCrunch fintech contributor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/gregg-schoenberg-2/">Gregg Schoenberg</a> went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/citizen-ray-bridgewaters-ray-dalio-is-the-wise-uncle-you-wished-you-had/">deep beneath the surface with an insider profile</a> of investor Ray Dalio. While Dalio is certainly a celebrity in the world of financial services, some outside of Wall Street might need a quick refresher on Dalio, his career and his influence.</p>
<p>Dalio built his reputation in the finance universe as the founder of the <a href="https://docs.preqin.com/reports/Preqin-Largest-Hedge-Fund-Managers-February-2019.pdf">world’s largest</a> hedge fund, <a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/">Bridgewater Associates</a>. With 40-plus years of operation under its belt, Bridgewater now manages roughly $160 billion in assets for a long list of the largest institutional investors from across the globe.</p>
<p>But outside of the investment community, Dalio has built up a chunky following through his book &#8220;<a href="https://www.principles.com/">Principles</a>,&#8221; which outlines his views on management, leadership and investing. &#8220;Principles&#8221; focuses on the best practices, mental frameworks and strategies that have worked for Dalio in both career and life.</p>
<p>While the set of tools presented in &#8220;Principles&#8221; can be observed in practice every day at Bridgewater, its efficacy seems to have proven to be at least somewhat applicable across backgrounds. Since the full version of the book’s publication in 2017, &#8220;Principles&#8221; has sold between <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ray-dalio-explains-his-principles-60-minutes-2019-07-28/">one to two million-plus copies</a>, been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/business-books">New York Times Best-Seller</a>, and has been praised by thought leaders across politics, business and the Valley, including Bill Gates, Marc Benioff and Reed Hastings.</p>
<p>More recently, in April, Dalio and his team launched the <a href="https://www.principles.com/principles-in-action/">Principles in Action</a> mobile iOS app, which includes the book’s full text intertwined with interactive videos (including some from actual internal Bridgewater meetings), animations, quizzes and case studies built to help users track personal growth goals. According to the app’s development team, since launch, Principles in Action has had roughly 115,000 downloads and an average of 30,000 monthly active users over the past three months, with users completing more than 5,000 case studies. The team pushes out updates every two to three weeks and plans to launch on Android in December.</p>
<p>And if Gregg’s deep profile on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch">Extra Crunch</a>, the &#8220;Principles&#8221; book and Principles in Action app didn’t offer enough access to Dalio’s brain, Dalio will also be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/ray-dalio-is-coming-to-disrupt-sf/">joining us for a fireside chat on the Extra Crunch stage</a> this October at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2019/">TechCrunch Disrupt SF</a>, where he will discuss how to build an effective and actionable culture at a startup of any scale.</p>
<p>Though he’s been stock investing since age 12, Dalio’s new passion is sharing to as broad an audience as possible the tactics to which he attributes his success. So join us on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch">Extra Crunch</a> and at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2019/">Extra Crunch Disrupt stage</a> for exclusive candid insights from Ray Dalio and the principles that have helped him become one of history’s most successful financial entrepreneurs.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The FCC is taking measures to make the launches of small satellites (but not large constellations) easier on the growing private space industry. The new licensing process should be simpler, easier, and more likely to yield a green light from the agency.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-communications-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-communications-commission">FCC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is taking measures to make the launches of small satellites (but not large constellations) easier on the growing private space industry. <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-streamlines-application-process-small-satellites">The new licensing process</a> should be simpler, easier and more likely to yield a green light from the agency.</p>
<p>Approved unanimously at today&#8217;s open FCC meeting, the new item essentially creates an express lane for anyone looking to launch fewer than 10 satellites weighing under 180 kilograms (about 400 pounds) each. There&#8217;s a new fee structure that should make it cheaper for these folks to apply, and should provide more certainty to them that their application will succeed.</p>
<p>This is an increasingly important segment of the satellite market, as startups, universities and aerospace companies send up experiments or prototypes on the growing number of cheap orbital launch services. It&#8217;s fundamentally different from the launch environment of the preceding few decades and the beginning of an entirely new market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8RjyGEFvOg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/24/spacex-reveals-more-starlink-info-after-launch-of-first-60-satellites/">SpaceX reveals more Starlink info after launch of first 60 satellites</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;SpaceX reveals more Starlink info after launch of first 60 satellites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/24/spacex-reveals-more-starlink-info-after-launch-of-first-60-satellites/embed/#?secret=8RjyGEFvOg" data-secret="8RjyGEFvOg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Many inside the new space industry have told me that regulation is one of their biggest worries, mainly because it&#8217;s complicated and time-consuming. A good regulator should know when to step in and when to get out of the way, and the FCC has clearly opted for the latter today.</p>
<p>Unanimous support is a rare thing when the agency so often divides down party lines on other proposals and rules. It&#8217;s not often you hear Commissioner Rosenworcel, who bitterly opposes many of Chairman Ajit Pai&#8217;s policies, enthuse about a rule, but in the statement accompanying her vote she says: &#8220;Count me as excited that the Chairman has brought this decision before us today. It has my full support.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commissioners noted that this is only one small improvement among many that need to happen in order to better promote space activity in the country.</p>
<p>Stemming the growing problem of orbital debris is one thing, and part of the new satellite licensing process requires applicants to minimize the debris they create. That&#8217;s a start, but entirely new rules are in the works, as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0ZDzYLjGGK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/kicksat-2-project-launches-105-cracker-sized-satellites/">KickSat-2 project launches 105 cracker-sized satellites</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;KickSat-2 project launches 105 cracker-sized satellites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/kicksat-2-project-launches-105-cracker-sized-satellites/embed/#?secret=0ZDzYLjGGK" data-secret="0ZDzYLjGGK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another, more FCC-native step to take is addressing the question of spectrum in space — that is, which slices of radio frequency should be assigned to orbital purposes, and what kind of restrictions should be placed on those purposes. With constellations of more than 10,000 satellites planned, the sky is going to get mighty noisy if we&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<p>For now, smaller organizations looking to make it to orbit will be breathing a sigh of relief that at least one part of the red tape has been yanked out from between them and their goal.</p>
<p>The rules as proposed last year before the comment period and revision can be found <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-streamline-application-process-small-satellites">here</a>, but the final rules should be on the FCC&#8217;s site soon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-dedicated-host/">announced</a> the preview launch of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/">Azure Dedicated Host</a>, a new cloud service that will allow you to run your virtual machines on single-tenant physical services. That means you&#8217;re not sharing any resources on that server with anybody else and you&#8217;ll get full control over everything that&#8217;s running on that machine.</p>
<p>Previously, Azure already offered <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-isolated-vm-sizes-now-available/">isolated Virtual Machine</a> sizes for two very large virtual machine types. Those are still available, but their use cases are comparably limited to these new hosts, which offer far more flexibility.</p>
<p>With this move, Microsoft is following in the footsteps of AWS, which also offers <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html">Dedicated Hosts</a> with very <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/pricing/">similar capabilities</a>. Google Cloud, too, offers what it calls &#8220;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/">sole-tenant nodes</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/">Azure Dedicated Host</a> will support Windows, Linux and SQL Server virtual machines and pricing is per host, independent of the number of virtual machines you end up running on them. You can currently opt for machines with up to 144 physical cores and prices start at $4.039 per hour.</p>
<p>To do this, Microsoft is offering two different processors to power these machines. Type 1 is based on the 2.3 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2673 v4 with up to 3.5 gigahertz of clock speed, while Type 2 features the Intel Xeon® Platinum 8168 with single-core clock speeds of up to 3.7 gigahertz. The available memory ranges from 32GiB to 448GiB. You can find more details <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/dedicated-host/">here</a>.</p>
<p>As Microsoft notes, these new dedicated hosts can help companies reach their compliance requirements for physical security, data integrity and monitoring. The dedicated hosts still share the same underlying infrastructure as any other host in the Azure data centers, but users have full control over any maintenance window that could impact their servers.</p>
<p>These dedicated hosts can also be grouped into larger host groups in a given Azure region, allowing you to build clusters of your own physical servers inside the Azure data center. Because you&#8217;re actually renting a physical machine, any hardware issue on that machine will impact the virtual machines you are running on them, so chances are you&#8217;ll want to have multiple dedicated hosts for your failover strategy anyway.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The original Versa was precisely the hit a stumbling Fitbit needed. The device was a simple and affordable Apple Watch alternative, helping the company finally break into the one bright spot in the wearable field. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/fitbit-lowers-guidance-after-versa-lite-disappoints/">yesterday’s earnings</a>, the Versa Lite has so far failed to recapture the Versa’s success by offering a fewer features at a discounted price.</p>
<p>The good news for Fitbit, however, is that a new Versa is already on the way. Spotted by perennial leaker, <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1156839334462525441">Evan Blass</a>, the device brings some hardware upgrades to the 2018’s device. The screen gets an update from LCD to AMOLED, along with a case refresh, which the Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/1/20750312/fitbit-versa-2-smartwatch-leak-alexa-oled-display-design">rightly notes</a> makes the squircle design even more Apple Watch-esque.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h5qxqBi2us"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/fitbit-versa-review/">Fitbit Versa review</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;Fitbit Versa review&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/fitbit-versa-review/embed/#?secret=h5qxqBi2us" data-secret="h5qxqBi2us" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Honestly, however, the biggest news about the device is probably smart assistant support. Wearables are among the key applications for voice interactions, so it certainly makes sense here. But what’s a poor wearable maker to do when the competition has Siri and Google Assistant? Simple: partner with Amazon.</p>
<p>No specifics on how Alexa will be used here, but the addition is a no-brainer for Fitbit. After all the money it pumped into acquisitions to create the Ionic and Versa, a proprietary smart assistant is probably a bridge too far at this point (and Samsung’s Bixby expenditures point to how difficult that growth can be). So the company enlisted an already extremely popular assistant with little wearable market share to show for it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In light of a so-far successful electric scooter pilot program in San Francisco, the city has opened up the application process for service providers to deploy their respective scooters as part of a more permanent program. However, the permits will only be valid for about one year, &#8220;reflecting the rapid pace at which the scooter industry continues to evolve,&#8221; <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/powered-scooter-share-program-evolves-beyond-pilot-phase">the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency wrote on its blog</a>.</p>
<p>That means starting in October 2019, we may see electric scooters from more than just Skip and Scoot. Skip and Scoot&#8217;s current permits expire October 14, 2019.</p>
<p>As part of the permitting program, the SFMTA plans to issue permits to &#8220;a limited number&#8221; of applicants, <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/powered-scooter-share-program-evolves-beyond-pilot-phase">the agency </a>said. The city also plans to maintain a cap on the number of scooters to be deployed at any one time, likely somewhere between 1,000 to 2,500 scooters per company. Currently, Skip is authorized to operate 800 scooters, while Scoot is authorized to operate up to 625.</p>
<p>The application requires companies to integrate locking mechanisms to all of its scooters, implement stricter policies to ensure people don&#8217;t ride on sidewalks as well as pilot adaptive scooters to ensure people with disabilities are not left out from this new form of transportation. This comes shortly after <a href="https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/adaptive-bike-share">Lyft began testing adaptive bike share for riders in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif</a>.</p>
<p>The deadline to apply is August 21, 2019, which gives the likes of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bird" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bird">Bird <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-scoot/">proud new owner of Scoot</a>), Skip, Lime, Uber/JUMP, Lyft, Spin and the many others a fair amount of time to get their things in order — that is, if they want to. All of those companies mentioned above applied for permits to operate as part of SF&#8217;s pilot program, but were denied. Some companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/12/sf-judge-denies-limes-request-to-block-electric-scooter-deployment/">took it worse</a> than others, while others decided to focus their efforts on other markets for the time being.</p>
<p>What we can expect is yet another battle among the electric scooter providers to deploy their vehicles in the highly coveted market of San Francisco. Last time, there were about one dozen applicants for the city&#8217;s pilot program.</p>
<p>On average, scooter riders took about 3,400 trips per day in San Francisco in May. Scoot has had a pretty drama-free existence in San Francisco, minus the whole theft and vandalism issue that forced the company to add a locking mechanism to its scooters. Skip, on the other hand, had to pull its scooters off the streets after one caught on fire in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>It would be odd if the SFMTA didn&#8217;t consider that as it looks over all of the applications this time around. Meanwhile, given that a couple of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/lyft-pulls-e-bikes-in-light-of-apparent-battery-fires/">Lyft&#8217;s electric bikes recently caught on fire</a> due to apparent issues with the batteries, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lyft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lyft">Lyft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has likely given the SFMTA some pause around the company&#8217;s abilities to safely deploy electric vehicles.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/aws-remains-in-firm-control-of-the-cloud-infrastructure-market/">the clear market leader</a> in the cloud infrastructure market, but it&#8217;s never been an organization that rests on its past successes. Whether it&#8217;s a flurry of new product announcements and enhancements every year, or making strategic acquisitions.</p>
<p>When it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/amazon-acquires-flash-based-cloud-storage-startup-e8-storage/">bought Israeli storage startup E8</a> yesterday, it might have felt like a minor move on its face, but AWS was looking, as it always does, to find an edge and reduce the costs of operations in its data centers. It was also very likely looking forward to the next phase of cloud computing. Reports have pegged the deal at between $50 and $60 million.</p>
<p>What E8 gives AWS for relatively cheap money is highly advanced storage capabilities, says Steve McDowell, senior storage analyst at Moor Research and Strategy. &#8220;E8 built a system that delivers extremely high-performance/low-latency flash (and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2017/04/26/intel-optane-memory-tested-makes-hard-drives-perform-like-ssds/#3cc794060909">Optane</a>) in a shared-storage environment,&#8221; McDowell told TechCrunch.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The somewhat zany mash-up of Ikea and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sonos" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sonos">Sonos <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ended up providing great results, in the form of the Symfonisk line of wireless speakers, including the $99 Symfonisk shelf speakers and the $179 Symfonisk table lamp speaker. The speakers are both on sale today, starting at retail stores first, with online availability to follow later.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/sonos-and-ikeas-symfonisk-wireless-speakers-are-a-symphony-of-sound-and-design/">In case you missed it, our review</a> found that these connected speakers, which work with all of Sonos&#8217; other offerings, are a great value for people new to the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sonos" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sonos">Sonos <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> system, or for anyone looking to build out their existing audio setup. The shelf speakers make great, affordable rears for surroundsound setups, and offer audio that isn&#8217;t quite up to par with the Sonos One, but that definitely won&#8217;t disappoint, especially if you pick up two and pair them for stereo sound.</p>
<p>The Symfonisk lamp is on par with the Sonos One when it comes to sound, and can offer smart lighting, too, when paired with Ikea&#8217;s Tradfri connected light bulbs. It&#8217;s a good-looking lamp in its own right, two, with a fabric cover and both light and dark finishes, depending on your decor preferences.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Featured snippets are surely one of the most useful features that Google added to its search engine in recent years. Today, the company announced that it has recently updated the algorithm that powers these snippets to <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/find-fresh-information-featured-snippets-google-search">prioritize more recent information</a>.</p>
<p>In Google&#8217;s example, the search engine would previously regularly feature outdated data because it didn&#8217;t fully understand what a user was actually looking for. Understanding the actual intent of a search query is hard, after all.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the core of Search is language understanding, and our systems don’t understand language the same way humans do,&#8221; writes Pandu Nayak, Google&#8217;s VP for Search. &#8220;This is why we’re constantly developing new ways to better understand your searches and provide relevant results, especially in cases where there is useful context that is implied, like whether freshness matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Google&#8217;s examples, that means a search for &#8220;upcoming school holidays&#8221; will now highlight the 2019/2020 holidays, not the 2018/2019 ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png"><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1863397" title="UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png" alt="UK school holiday calendar design.max 1000x1000" width="1000" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png?resize=768,396 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UK_school_holiday_calendar_design.max-1000x1000.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>Similarly, when you look for information about upcoming events, this new algorithm will try to give you fresher and hence more accurate information. The example Google gives here is the premiere of Stranger Things 3. If you were looking for that before the update and before the lackluster third season hit Netflix, the algorithm would&#8217;ve highlighted an older post from 2018 with an unspecific date. After the update, it would&#8217;ve given you the exact date as soon as possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">High-priced, handmade boutique sports cars typically make their debut where the well-heeled and the media gather. Pagani took a different approach this time around.</p>
<p>The Italian supercar manufacturer unveiled its new nearly $3.5 million Huayra Roadster BC in CSR2, the mobile game produced by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zynga" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zynga">Zynga <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The physical car will eventually get its moment. Pagani will show off the hypercar to the public next month at the Monterey Car Show. In the meantime, Zynga rebuilt the Pagani Huayra Roadster BC in CSR2, giving users a chance to &#8220;drive&#8221; the supercar.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png"><img class="breakout alignnone wp-image-1863063 size-full" title="Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png" alt="Pagani HuayraBCRoadsterPB 2019 RaceScreenshot 2" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pagani_HuayraBCRoadsterPB_2019_RaceScreenshot_2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">“When Horacio Pagani first began designing cars 44 years ago, it would have been impossible to imagine that a car like the Roadster BC would ever be unveiled to the world in a mobile game,” Michael Staskin, managing director of Pagani Automobili America, said in a statement. “We chose to partner with CSR2 on the reveal of the Roadster BC because we are both leaders in our respective industries, we both show incredible attention to design and detail and we both continue to disrupt what is considered normal in the automotive industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSR2 players can enter the 80-race ladder by using a Pagani Huayra Coupé. During the game, players get the chance to add the Pagani Huayra Roadster BC to their collection. Using augmented reality, players can also park their Pagani cars in their real-world driveways and open every panel to study the details close up.</p>
<p>In the real world, the Pagani Huayra Roadster BC gets its power from a 6.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V12 engine built for Pagani by Mercedes-AMG. The result is an engine that produces 800 horsepower at 5,900 rpm and 774 pound feet of torque. It boasts a seven-speed, single-clutch automated manual transmission and weighs 2,756 pounds, just a skosh lighter than the regular Huayra Roadster.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the Roadster BC is a fast can-you-handle-how-it-corners beast that accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds and generates 1.9 of lateral grips through corners.</p>
<p>Sadly, few will get to drive this real-world version. Pagani will make only 40 of Roadster BCs.</p>

If you, your loved ones, colleagues, or staff are immigrants, then you need to learn to separate the signal from the noise.</p>
