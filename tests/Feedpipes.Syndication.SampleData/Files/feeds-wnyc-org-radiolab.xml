</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/worlds-smartest-animal/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode begins with a rant. This rant, in particular, comes from Dan Engber - a science writer who loves animals but despises animal intelligence research. Dan told us that so much of the way we study animals involves tests that we think show a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;human&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is smart ... not the animals we intend to study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dan’s rant got us thinking: What &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the smartest animal in the world? And if we threw out our human intelligence rubric, is there a fair way to figure it out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obviously, there is. And it’s a live game show, judged by Jad, Robert … and a dog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last episode of G, Radiolab’s miniseries on intelligence, we’re sharing that game show with you. It was recorded as a live show back in May 2019 at the Greene Space in New York City. We invited two science writers, Dan Engber and Laurel Braitman, and two comedians, Tracy Clayton and Jordan Mendoza, to compete against one another to find the world’s smartest animal. What resulted were a series of funny, delightful stories about unexpectedly smart animals and a shift in the way we think about intelligence across all the animals - including us.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/g-unnatural-selection/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This past fall, a scientist named Steve Hsu made headlines with a provocative announcement. He would start selling a genetic intelligence test to couples doing IVF: a sophisticated prediction tool, built on big data and machine learning, designed to help couples select the best embryo in their batch. We wondered, how does that work? What can the test really say? And do we want to live in a world where certain people can decide how smart their babies will be?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When a law student named Mark Bold came across a Supreme Court decision from the 1920s that allowed for the forced sterilization of people deemed “unfit,” he was shocked to discover that it had never been overturned. His law professors told him the case, Buck v Bell, was nothing to worry about, that the ruling was in a kind of legal limbo and could never be used against people. But he didn’t buy it. In this episode we follow Mark on a journey to one of the darkest consequences of humanity’s attempts to measure the human mind and put people in boxes, following him through history, science fiction and a version of eugenics that’s still very much alive today, and watch as he crusades to restore a dash of moral order to the universe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/g-relative-genius/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Albert Einstein asked that when he died, his body be cremated and his ashes be scattered in a secret location. He didn’t want his grave, or his body, becoming a shrine to his genius. When he passed away in the early morning hours of April, 18, 1955, his family knew his wishes. There was only one problem: the pathologist who did the autopsy had different plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the third episode of “G”, Radiolab’s miniseries on intelligence, we go on one of the strangest scavenger hunts for genius the world has ever seen. We follow Einstein’s stolen brain from that Princeton autopsy table, to a cider box in Wichita, Kansas, to labs all across the country. And eventually, beyond the brain itself entirely. All the while wondering, where exactly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the genius of a man who changed the way we view the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was reported by Rachael Cusick and Pat Walters, and produced by Bethel Habte, Rachael Cusick, and Pat Walters. Music by Alex Overington and Jad Abumrad. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special thanks to: Elanor Taylor, Claudia Kalb, Dustin O’Halloran, Tim Huson, The Einstein Papers Project, and all the physics for (us) dummies Youtube videos that accomplished the near-impossible feat of helping us understand relativity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The lawsuit, Larry P v Riles, ended with a ban on IQ tests for all Black students in the state of California, a ban that’s still in place today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we meet the families in California dealing with that ban forty years later. Families the ban was designed to protect, but who now say it discriminates against their children. How much have IQ tests changed since the 70s? And can they be used for good? We talk to the people responsible for designing the most widely used modern IQ test, and along the way, we find out that at the very same moment the IQ test was being put on trial in California, on the other side of the country, it was being used to solve one of the biggest public health problems of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/confirm-nor-deny/</link><description>&lt;p&gt; How a sunken nuclear submarine, a crazy billionaire, and a mechanical claw gave birth to a phrase that has hounded journalists and lawyers for 40 years and embodies the tension between the public’s desire for transparency and the government’s need to keep secrets.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether it comes from government spokespeople or celebrity publicists, the phrase “can neither confirm nor deny” is the perfect non-denial denial. It’s such a perfect deflection that it seems like it’s been around forever, but reporter &lt;a href="http://www.juliabarton.com"&gt;Julia Barton&lt;/a&gt; takes us back to the 1970s and the surprising origin story of what’s now known as a “Glomar Response.” With help from David Sharp and Walt Logan, we tell the story of a clandestine CIA operation to lift a sunken Soviet submarine from the ocean floor and the dilemma they faced when the world found out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 40 years since that operation, the Glomar Response has become boilerplate language from an array of government agencies. With help from ProPublica editor Jeff Larson and NPR’s Dina Temple-Raston, we explore the implications of this ultimate information dodge. ACLU lawyer Jameel Jaffer explains how it stymies oversight, and we learn that, even 40 years later, governmental secrecy can be emotionally painful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After listening to the story ... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;After 40 years, many of the details of Project Azorian are only now coming to light. The US government’s default position has been to keep as much of it classified as possible. It took three years for retired CIA employee David Sharp to get permission &lt;a href="http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/shacia.html"&gt;to publish his account&lt;/a&gt; of Project Azorian. And FOIA played an indirect role in that, as Cold War historians got the CIA to release, in redacted form, &lt;a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb305/"&gt;an internal history of the mission&lt;/a&gt;. After that and a threat of legal action, Sharp was finally able to publish his manuscript in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;We mentioned conspiracy theories that have swirled around Project Azorian filling the void where official silence has reigned. One of them is promulgated in the 2005 book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Star-Rogue-Submarines-Nuclear/dp/1416527338"&gt;“Red Star Rogue” by Kenneth Sewell and Clint Richmond.&lt;/a&gt; They posit that the K-129 was taken over by rogue Stalinist KGB agents in order to start a nuclear conflict. But the conflict was to be between the US and China, as, according to the authors, the sub had powers to disguise its sonic signature as a Chinese Navy vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;This book is the basis of the 2013 drama &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1922685/"&gt;“Phantom,”&lt;/a&gt; which features Ed Harris and David Duchovny as Soviet military officers who sip vodka in a very un-Russian way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;Russian Naval historians, &lt;a href="http://www.northfleet.ru/"&gt;like Nikolai Cherkashin&lt;/a&gt;, are not only insulted by this take on the cause of the K-129’s demise, they say the true cause is much easier to pinpoint: They say an American vessel, possibly the USS Swordfish, &lt;a href="http://english.pravda.ru/news/russia/10-09-2007/96959-sunken_submarine-0/"&gt;collided with the Soviet submarine.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the fact that the US government has turned over many documents about Project Azorian and what it found to the Russian government, many in the Russian Navy stand by their theory that it was far too easy for the US to locate the K-129 on the bottom of the Pacific, given the technology of the time. According to these theories, Project Azorian was nothing more than an elaborate cover-up disguised as... an elaborate cover-up. We can neither confirm nor deny that we exactly understand how that would have worked in practice or execution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;But for our money, there’s probably no stranger and more telling document from this time &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWMo7aHDRo&amp;amp;noredirect=1"&gt;than a video of the funeral at sea for Soviet sailors&lt;/a&gt; ostensibly recovered by the US during Project Azorian. Audio of the service starts at 1:25 in this post. Eulogies and rites are performed in both English and Russian (albeit with an American accent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s one of the more solemn moments of the Cold War, and one that the Glomar Response helped keep a secret for a very long time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/good-samaritan/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On a Tuesday afternoon back in the summer of 2017, Scotty Hatton and Scottie Wightman both made a decision to help someone in need. They both paid a price for their actions that day, which have led to a legal, moral, and scientific puzzle about how we balance accountability and forgiveness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bit-flip/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back in 2003, Belgium was holding a national election. One of their first where the votes would be cast and counted on computers. Thousands of hours of preparation went into making it unhackable. And when the day of the vote came, everything seemed to have gone well. That was, until a cosmic chain of events caused a single bit to flip and called the outcome into question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today on Radiolab, we travel from a voting booth in Brussels to the driver's seat of a runaway car in the Carolinas, exploring the massive effects tiny bits of stardust can have on us unwitting humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/fu-go/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week we’re going back to a favorite episode from 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, something happened that nobody ever talks about. This is a tale of mysterious balloons, cowboy sheriffs, and young children caught up in the winds of war. And silence, the terror of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporters Peter Lang-Stanton and Nick Farago tell us the story of a seemingly ridiculous, almost whimsical series of attacks on the US between November of 1944 and May of 1945. With the help of writer Ross Coen, geologist Elisa Bergslien, and professor Mike Sweeney, we uncover a national secret that led to tragedy in a sleepy logging town in south central Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Check out p&lt;span&gt;ictures of the ghostly balloons &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/pictures-fu-go"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>During World War II, something happened that nobody ever talks about. This is a tale of mysterious balloons, cowboy sheriffs, and young children caught up in the winds of war. And silence, the terror of silence.</p>
<p>Reporters Peter Lang-Stanton and Nick Farago tell us the story of a seemingly ridiculous, almost whimsical series of attacks on the US between November of 1944 and May of 1945. With the help of writer Ross Coen, geologist Elisa Bergslien, and professor Mike Sweeney, we uncover a national secret that led to tragedy in a sleepy logging town in south central Oregon.</p>

Then again, they said, she wasn’t a exactly an immigrant either. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And they said that the US territory of Puerto Rico, Isabel’s home, was “foreign to the United States in a domestic sense.” Since then, the US has cleared up at least some of the confusion about US territories and the status of people born in them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But, more than a hundred years later, there is still a US territory that has been left in limbo: American Samoa. It is the only place on earth that is US soil, but people who are born there are not automatically US citizens. When we visit American Samoa, we discover that there are some pretty surprising reasons why many American Samoans prefer it that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This hour, Radiolab revisits the strange things that emerge when something happens, then happens again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and… well, again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode of Radiolab, Jad and Robert try to explain an inexplicable comedy act, listen to a loop that literally dies in your ear, and they learn about a loop that sent a shudder up the collective spine of mathematicians everywhere. Finally, they talk to a woman who got to watch herself think the thought that she was watching herself think the thought that she was watching herself think the thought that ... you get the point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/more-perfect-sex-appeal/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the news and on the big screen recently, we decided to play the &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect/season-two" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More Perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show about her from back in November of 2017. This is the story of how Ginsburg, as a young &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lawyer at the ACLU, convinced an all-male Supreme Court to take discrimination against women seriously - using a case on discrimination against men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Julia Longoria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-clockwork-miracle/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As legend goes, in 1562, King Philip II needed a miracle. So he commissioned one from a highly-skilled clockmaker. In this short, a king's deal with God leads to an intricate mechanical creation, and Jad heads to the Smithsonian to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the 17-year-old crown prince of Spain, Don Carlos, fell down a set of stairs in 1562, he threw his whole country into a state of uncertainty about the future. Especially his father, King Philip II, who despite being the most powerful man in the world, was helpless in the face of his heir's terrible head wound. When none of the leading remedies of the day--bleeding, blistering, purging, or drilling--helped, the king enlisted the help of a relic...the corpse of a local holy man who had died 100 years earlier. Then, Philip II promised that if God saved his son, he'd repay him with a miracle of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/thesizesofthings.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, describes how--according to legend--Philip II held up his end of the bargain with the help of a renowned clockmaker and an intricate invention. Jad and Latif head to the Smithsonian to meet curator Carlene E. Stephens, who shows them the inner workings of a nearly 450-year-old monkbot. &lt;/p&gt;

A word we need when we bump into someone on the street, or break someone’s heart. In our increasingly disconnected secular world, “sorry” has been stretched and twisted, and in some cases weaponized. But it’s also one of the only ways we have to piece together a sense of shared values and beliefs.

&lt;p&gt;Today on Radiolab, just a day before the American midterm elections, we ask a different question: how do we fix it?  We scrutinize one proposed tweak to the way we vote that could make politics in this country more representative, more moderate, and most shocking of all, more civil.  Could this one surprisingly do-able mathematical fix really turn political campaigning from a rude bloodsport to a campfire singalong? And even if we could do that, would we want to?&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/war-worlds/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's been 80 years to the day since Orson Welles' infamous radio drama "The War of the Worlds" echoed far and wide over the airwaves. So we want to bring you back to our very first live hour, where we take a deep dive into what was one of the most controversial moments in broadcasting history. "The War of the Worlds," a radio play about Martians invading New Jersey, caused panic when it originally aired, and it's continued to fool people since--from Santiago, Chile to Buffalo, New York to a particularly disastrous evening in Quito, Ecuador.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And we found that despite colleges now being steeped in conversations about consent, there was another conversation in intimate moments that just wasn't happening. In search of a script, we dive into the details of BDSM negotiations and are left wondering if all of this talk about consent is ignoring a larger problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most of these cases have involved unequivocal breaches of consent, some of which have been criminal. But what have also emerged are conversations surrounding more difficult situations to parse &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ones that exist in a much grayer space. When we started our own reporting through this gray zone, we stumbled into a challenging conversation that we can’t stop thinking about. In this second episode of ‘In the No’, radio-maker Kaitlin Prest joins us for a conversation with Hanna Stotland, an educational consultant who specializes in crisis management. Her clients include students who have been expelled from school for sexual misconduct. In the aftermath, Hanna helps them reapply to school. While Hanna shares some of her more nuanced and confusing cases, we wrestle with questions of culpability, generational divides, and the utility of fear in changing our culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisory: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode contains some graphic language and descriptions of very sensitive sexual situations, including discussions of sexual assault, consent and accountability, which may be very difficult for people to listen to.

That show, which dives into the experience, moment by moment, of navigating sexual intimacy, struck a chord with many of us. It's gorgeous, deeply personal, and incredibly thoughtful. And it seemed to presage a much larger conversation that is happening all around us in this moment. And so we decided to embark, with Kaitlin, on our own exploration of this topic. Over the next three episodes, we'll wander into rooms full of college students, hear from academics and activists, and sit in on classes about BDSM.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/breaking-bad-news-bears/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, a challenge: bear with us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;We decided to shake things up at the show so we threw our staff a curveball, Walter Matthau-style. In two weeks time we told our producers to pitch, report, and produce stories about breaking news….or bears. What emerged was a sort of love letter for our honey-loving friends and a discovery that they embody so much more than we could have imagined: a town’s symbol for hope, a celebrity, a foe, and a clue to future ways we’ll deal with our changing environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported and produced by Simon Adler, Molly Webster, Bethel Habte, Pat Walters, Matt Kielty, Rachael Cusick, Annie McEwen and Latif Nasser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Wendy Card, Marlene Zuk, Karyn Rode, Barbara Nielsen and Steven Amstrup at Polar Bears International, Jimmy Thomson, Adam Kudlak, Greg Durner, Todd Atwood, and Dawn Curtis and the Environment and Natural Resources Department of Northwest Territories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Quammen tells us about a shocking way that life can evolve - infective heredity. To figure it all out we go back to the earliest versions of life, and we revisit an earlier version of Radiolab. After reckoning with a scientific icon, we find ourselves in a tangle of genes that sheds new light on peppered moths, drug-resistant bugs, and a key moment in the evolution of life when mammals went a little viral.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/baby-blue-blood-drive/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Horseshoe crabs are not much to look at.  But beneath their unassuming catcher’s-mitt shell, they harbor a half-billion-year-old secret: a superpower that helped them outlive the dinosaurs and survive all the Earth’s mass extinctions.  And what is that secret superpower? Their blood. Their baby blue blood.  And it’s so miraculous that for decades, it hasn’t just been saving their butts, it’s been saving ours too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But that all might be about to change.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Follow us as we follow these ancient critters - from a raunchy beach orgy to a marine blood drive to the most secluded waterslide - and learn a thing or two from them about how much we depend on nature and how much it depends on us.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/post-no-evil/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008 Facebook began writing a document. It was a constitution of sorts, laying out what could and what couldn’t be posted on the site. Back then, the rules were simple, outlawing nudity and gore. Today, they’re anything but. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you define hate speech? Where’s the line between a joke and an attack? How much butt is too much butt? Facebook has answered these questions. And from these answers they’ve written a rulebook that all 2.2 billion of us are expected to follow. Today, we explore that rulebook. We dive into its details and untangle its logic. All the while wondering what does this mean for the future of free speech?&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bad-show/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;With all of the black-and-white moralizing in our world today, we decided to bring back an old show about the little bit of bad that's in all of us...and the little bit of really, &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;bad that's in some of us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruelty, violence, badness... in this episode we begin with a chilling statistic: 91% of men, and 84% of women, have fantasized about killing someone. We take a look at one particular fantasy lurking behind these numbers, and wonder what this shadow world might tell us about ourselves and our neighbors. Then, we reconsider what Stanley Milgram's famous experiment really revealed about human nature (it's both better and worse than we thought). Next, we meet a man who scrambles our notions of good and evil: chemist Fritz Haber, who won a Nobel Prize in 1918...around the same time officials in the US were calling him a war criminal. And we end with the story of a man who chased one of the most prolific serial killers in US history, then got a chance to ask him the question that had haunted him for years: why?&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/sex-ed/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If there’s one thing Gonads taught us, it’s just how complicated human reproduction is. All the things we thought we knew about biology and sex determination are up for debate in a way that feels both daunting and full of potential. At the same time, we're at a moment where we’re wrestling with how to approach conversations around sex, consent, and boundaries, at a time that may be more divisive than ever. So host Molly Webster thought: what if we took on sex ed, and tried to tackle questions from listeners, youth, reddit (oh boy), and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But instead of approaching these questions the way your high school health teacher might’ve (or government teacher, who knows), Molly invited a cast of storytellers, educators, artists, and comedians to grapple with sex ed in unexpected and thoughtful ways. To help us think about how we can change the conversation. In this episode, an edited down version of a Gonads Live show, Molly's team takes a crack at responding to the intimate questions you asked when you were younger but probably never got a straight answer to. Featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Do You Talk About Condoms Without Condom Demonstrations?&lt;/strong&gt; Sanford Johnson. Wanna see how to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06kT9yfj7QE"&gt;put on a sock&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are Periods?&lt;/strong&gt; Sindha Agha and Gul Agha. Check out Sindha's photography &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/gonads-presents-sindha-agha/?token=c1522cc189aba26b95e7ead97eb15588&amp;amp;content_type_id=26&amp;amp;object_id=871232&amp;amp;_=e09f8a73"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Anything Off-Limits?&lt;/strong&gt; Ericka Hart, Dalia Mahgoub, and Jonathan Zimmerman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do We Do This Anyway? And Other Queries from Fifth Graders&lt;/strong&gt; Jo Firestone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Sex Ed" is an edited* recording of a live event hosted by Radiolab at the Skirball Center in New York City on May 16, 2018. Radiolab Team Gonads is Molly Webster, Pat Walters, and Rachael Cusick, with Jad Abumrad. Live music, including the sex ed questions, and the Gonads theme song, were written, performed, and produced by Majel Connery and Alex Overington. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Over the past few months, Radiolab has been collecting sex ed book suggestions from listeners and staff, about the books that helped them understand the birds and the bees.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dana/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;When Dana Zzyym applied for their first passport back in 2014, they were handed a pretty straightforward application. Name, place of birth, photo ID -- the usual. But one question on the application stopped Dana in their tracks: male or female? Dana, technically, wasn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;In this episode, we follow the story of Dana Zzyym, Navy veteran and activist, which starts long before they scribble the word "intersex” on their passport application. Along the way, we see what happens when our inner biological realities bump into the outside world, and the power of words to shape us.&lt;/p&gt;

It was so aggressive, there was a real chance she might die. Her oncologists wanted her to start treatment immediately. Like, end-of-the-week immediately. But before Annie started treatment, she walked out of the doctor’s office and crossed the street to see a fertility doctor doing an experimental procedure that sounded like science fiction: ovary freezing.</p>

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We originally posted this episode in 2015, and it inspired producer Molly Webster to take a deep dive into the wild and mysterious world of human reproduction. Starting next week, she’ll be taking over the Radiolab podcast feed for a month to present a series of mind-bending stories that make us rethink the ways we make more of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You know the drill - all it takes is one sperm, one egg, and blammo - you got yourself a baby. Right? Well, in this episode, conception takes on a new form - it’s the sperm and the egg, plus: two wombs, four countries, and money. Lots of money. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this is the story of an Israeli couple, two guys, who go to another continent to get themselves a baby - three, in fact - by hiring surrogates to carry the children for them. As we follow them on their journey, an earth shaking revelation shifts our focus from them, to the surrogate mothers. Unfolding in real time, as countries around the world consider bans on surrogacy, this episode looks at a relationship that manages to feel deeply affecting, and deeply uncomfortable, all at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birthstory is a collaboration with the brilliant radio show and podcast Israel Story, created to tell stories for, and about, Israel. &lt;a href="https://israelstory.org/en/episodes/"&gt;Go check ‘em out! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio Extra:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tal and Amir had a chance to meet each surrogate once - just after the deliveries, after all the paperwork was sorted out, and before any one left Nepal. As Amir says, they wanted to say "a big thank you." These meetings between intended parents, surrogate, and new babies are a traditional part of the surrogacy process in India and Nepal, and we heard reports from the surrogates that they also look forward to them. These moments do not stigmatize, reveal the identity of, or endanger the surrogates. Tal and Amir provided the audio for this web extra.&lt;/p&gt;

For Brenna, the experience was so odd, and oddly comforting, that she decided to dive into the birth story of this invisible network of poison experts, and try to understand the evolving relationship we humans have with our poisonous planet. As we learn about how poison control has changed over the years, we end up wondering what a place devoted to data and human connection can tell us about ourselves in this cultural moment of anxiety and information-overload.</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/unraveling-bolero/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we're throwing it back to an old favorite: a story about obsession, creativity, and a strange symmetry between a biologist and a composer that revolves around one famously repetitive piece of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne Adams was a brilliant biologist. But when her son Alex was in a bad car accident, she decided to stay home to help him recover. And then, rather suddenly, she decided to quit science altogether and become a full-time artist. After that, her husband &lt;span&gt;Robert Adams&lt;/span&gt; tells us, she just painted and painted and painted. First houses and buildings, then a series of paintings involving strawberries, and then ... "Bolero."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, Anne became obsessed with Maurice Ravel's famous composition and decided to put an elaborate visual rendition of the song to canvas. She called it "Unraveling Bolero." But at the time, she had no idea that both she and Ravel would themselves unravel shortly after their experiences with this odd piece of music. &lt;span&gt;Arbie Orenstein&lt;/span&gt; tells us what happened to Ravel after he wrote "Bolero," and neurologist &lt;span&gt;Bruce Miller&lt;/span&gt; helps us understand how, for both Anne and Ravel, "Bolero" might have been the first symptom of a deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/more-or-less-human/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago chatbots - those robotic texting machines - were a mere curiosity. They were noticeably robotic and at their most malicious seemed only capable of scamming men looking for love online. Today, the chatbot landscape is wildly different. From election interference to spreading hate, chatbots have become online weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we decided to reinvestigate the role these robotic bits of code play in our lives and the effects they’re having on us. We begin with a little theater. In our live show “Robert or Robot?” Jad and Robert test 100 people to see if they can spot a bot. We then take a brief detour to revisit the humanity of the Furby, and finish in a virtual house where the line between technology and humanity becomes blurrier than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the original version of our “More or Less Human” podcast, our introduction of neuroscientist Mavi Sanchez-Vives began with mention of her husband, Mel Slater. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’ve edited that introduction because i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;t was a mistake to introduce her first as someone’s wife. Dr. Sanchez-Vives is an exceptional scientist and we’re sorry that the original introduction distracted from or diminished her work. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On a personal note, I failed to take due note of this while editing the piece, and in doing so, I flubbed what’s known as the &lt;a href="http://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2017/10/26/the-finkbeiner-test-a-tool-for-writing-about-women-in-their-professions/%20"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finkbeiner Test&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;(all the more embarrassing given that Ann Finkebeiner is a mentor and one of my favorite science journalists). In addition to being a mistake, this is also a reminder to all of us at Radiolab that we need to be more aware of our blind spots.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dark-side-earth/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Astronauts at the International Space Station can make one request to talk to an earthling of their choice. For some reason, Astronaut Mark Vande Hei chose us. A couple weeks ago, we were able to video chat with Mark and peer over his shoulder through the Cupola, an observatory room in the ISS. Traveling at 17,000 miles an hour, we zoomed from the Rockies to the East Coast in minutes. And from where Mark sits, the total darkness of space isn’t very far away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to Mark brought us back to 2012, when we spoke to another astronaut, Dave Wolf. When we were putting together our live show &lt;em&gt;In the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, Jad and Robert called up Dave Wolf to ask him if he had any stories about darkness. And boy, did he. Dave told us two stories that  became the finale of our show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" src="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/imagery/photos/sts-86/86p-036.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" src="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/imagery/photos/sts-86/86p-027.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;Back in late 1997, Dave Wolf was on his first spacewalk, to perform work on the Mir (the photo to the right was taken during that mission, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/sts86/photo/sts-86-photo-36.htm" target="_blank"&gt;NASA.&lt;/a&gt;). Dave wasn't alone -- with him was veteran Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev. (That's a picture of Dave giving Anatoly a hug on board the Mir, also courtesy of &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/sts86/photo/sts-86-photo-27.htm" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out in blackness of space, the contrast between light and dark is almost unimaginably extreme -- every 45 minutes, you plunge between absolute darkness on the night-side of Earth, and blazing light as the sun screams into view. Dave and Anatoly were tethered to the spacecraft, traveling 5 miles per second. That's 16 times faster than we travel on Earth's surface as it rotates -- so as they orbited, they experienced 16 nights and 16 days for every Earth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave's description of his first spacewalk was all we could've asked for, and more. But what happened next ... well, it's just one of those stories that you always hope an astronaut will tell. Dave and Anatoly were ready to call it a job and head back into the Mir when something went wrong with the airlock. They couldn't get it to re-pressurize. In other words, they were locked out. After hours of trying to fix the airlock, they were running out of the resources that kept them alive in their space suits and facing a grisly death. So, they unhooked their tethers, and tried one last desperate move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, they made it through, and Dave went on to perform dozens more spacewalks in the years to come, but he never again experienced anything like those harrowing minutes trying to improvise his way back into the Mir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that terrifying tale, Dave told us about another moment he and Anatoly shared, floating high above Earth, staring out into the universe ... a moment so beautiful, and peaceful, we decided to use the audience recreate it, as best we could, for the final act of our live show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of what it looks like during the brightness of day, here's another photo taken in 2009 -- more than a decade after the adventure described in our podcast -- this time of astronaut Tom Marshburn (Dave Wolf is with him, out of frame, photo courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1425.html" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

Dave and Anatoly were tethered to the spacecraft, traveling 5 miles per second. That's 16 times faster than we travel on Earth's surface as it rotates -- so as they orbited, they experienced 16 nights and 16 days for every Earth day.</p>
<p>Dave's description of his first spacewalk was all we could've asked for, and more. But what happened next ... well, it's just one of those stories that you always hope an astronaut will tell. Dave and Anatoly were ready to call it a job and head back into the Mir when something went wrong with the airlock. They couldn't get it to re-pressurize. In other words, they were locked out. After hours of trying to fix the airlock, they were running out of the resources that kept them alive in their space suits and facing a grisly death. So, they unhooked their tethers, and tried one last desperate move.</p>
<p>In the end, they made it through, and Dave went on to perform dozens more spacewalks in the years to come, but he never again experienced anything like those harrowing minutes trying to improvise his way back into the Mir.</p>
<p>After that terrifying tale, Dave told us about another moment he and Anatoly shared, floating high above Earth, staring out into the universe ... a moment so beautiful, and peaceful, we decided to use the audience recreate it, as best we could, for the final act of our live show.</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/border-trilogy-part-3-what-remains/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Border Trilogy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De León happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness. In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since. Jason traced this increase to a Border Patrol policy still in effect, called “Prevention Through Deterrence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over three episodes, Radiolab will investigate this policy, its surprising origins, and the people whose lives were changed forever because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3: What Remains &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third episode in our Border Trilogy follows anthropologist Jason De León after he makes a grisly discovery in Arivaca, Arizona. In the middle of carrying out his pig experiments with his students, Jason finds the body of a 30-year-old female migrant. With the help of the medical examiner and some local humanitarian groups, Jason discovers her identity. Her name was Maricela. Jason then connects with her family, including her brother-in-law, who survived his own harrowing journey through Central America and the Arizona desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the human cost of Prevention Through Deterrence weighing on our minds, we try to parse what drives migrants like Maricela to cross through such deadly terrain, and what, if anything, could deter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Latif Nasser and Tracie Hunte and was produced by Matt Kielty and Tracie Hunte. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Hold the Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the showdown in court with Bowie High School, Border Patrol brings in a fresh face to head its dysfunctional El Paso Sector: Silvestre Reyes. The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de León realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Part 2: Hold the Line</p>
<p>After the showdown in court with Bowie High School, Border Patrol brings in a fresh face to head its dysfunctional El Paso Sector: Silvestre Reyes. The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border.</p>
<p>Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de León realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected.</p>

&lt;p&gt;While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De León happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Hole in the Fence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We begin one afternoon in May 1992, when a student named Albert stumbled in late for history class at Bowie High School in El Paso, Texas. His excuse: Border Patrol. Soon more stories of students getting stopped and harassed by Border Patrol started pouring in. So begins the unlikely story of how a handful of Mexican-American high schoolers in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country stood up to what is today the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency. They had no way of knowing at the time, but what would follow was a chain of events that would drastically change the US-Mexico border. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/rippin-the-rainbow-an-even-newer-one/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of our most popular episodes of all time was our &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/211119-colors/"&gt;Colors episode&lt;/a&gt;, where we introduced you to a sea creature that could see a rainbow far beyond what humans can experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peacock mantis shrimps are as extraordinary as they are strange and boast what may well be the most complicated visual system in the world. They each have 16 photoreceptors compared to our measly three. But recently researchers in Australia put the mantis shrimps’ eyes to the test only to discover that sure, they can SEE lots of colors, but that doesn't mean they can tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when two colors are close together - like yellow and yellow-y green - they can’t seem to tell them apart at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-presents-more-perfect-gun-show/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The shooting in Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018, reignited an increasingly familiar debate about guns in this country. Today, we’re re-releasing a &lt;em&gt;More Perfect &lt;/em&gt;episode that aired just after the Las Vegas shooting last year that attempts to make sense of our country’s fraught relationship with the Second Amendment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;For nearly 200 years of our nation’s history, the Second Amendment was an all-but-forgotten rule about the importance of militias.

It's the end of the 19th century -- the Civil War is over, and the frontier is dead. And young college men are anxious. What great struggle will test their character? Then along comes a new craze: football. A brutally violent game where young men can show a stadium full of fans just what they're made of. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn -- the sons of the most powerful men in the country are literally knocking themselves out to win these gladiatorial battles. And then the most American team of all, with the most to prove, gets in the game and owns it. The Carlisle Indian School, formed in 1879 to assimilate the children and grandchildren of the men who fought the final Plains Wars against the fathers and grandfathers of the Ivy Leaguers, starts challenging the best teams in the country. On the football field, Carlisle had a chance for a fair fight with high stakes -- a chance to earn respect, a chance to be winners, and a chance to go forward in a changing world that was destroying theirs. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-presents-more-perfect-one-nation-under-money/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;An unassuming string of 16 words tucked into the Constitution grants Congress extensive power to make laws that impact the entire nation. The Commerce Clause has allowed Congress to intervene in all kinds of situations — from penalizing one man for growing too much wheat on his farm, to enforcing the end of racial segregation nationwide. That is, if the federal government can make an economic case for it. This seemingly all-powerful tool has the potential to unite the 50 states into one nation and protect the civil liberties of all. But it also challenges us to consider: when we make everything about money, what does it cost us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key voices:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roscoe Filbrun Jr., Son of Roscoe Filbrun Sr., respondent in Wickard v. Filburn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ollie McClung Jr., Son of Ollie McClung Sr., respondent in Katzenbach v. McClung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?prof=880"&gt;James M. Chen&lt;/a&gt;, professor at Michigan State University College of Law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/people/jami-floyd/"&gt;Jami Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, legal analyst and host of WNYC’s All Things Considered who, as a domestic policy advisor in the Clinton White House, worked on the Violence Against Women Act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/ari_savitzky/"&gt;Ari J. Savitzky&lt;/a&gt;, lawyer at WilmerHale &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key cases:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1824: &lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/22us1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gibbons v. Ogden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1942: &lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/317us111"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wickard v. Filburn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1964: &lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1964/543"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katzenbach v. McClung&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000: &lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1999/99-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States v. Morrison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/11-393"&gt;National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/voice-your-head-tribute-joe-frank/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you pay proper tribute to a legend that many people haven’t heard of?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We began asking ourselves this question last week when the visionary radio producer Joe Frank passed away, after a long struggle with colon cancer.  Joe Frank was the radio producer’s radio producer.  He told stories that were thrillingly weird, deeply mischievous (and sometimes head-spinningly confusing!). He had a big impact on us at Radiolab.  For Jad, his Joe Frank moment happened in 2002, while sitting at a mixing console in an AM radio studio waiting to read the weather.  Joe Frank's Peabody Award-winning series "Rent-A-Family” came on the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Time stood still.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="p1">We began asking ourselves this question last week when the visionary radio producer Joe Frank passed away, after a long struggle with colon cancer.  Joe Frank was the radio producer’s radio producer.  He told stories that were thrillingly weird, deeply mischievous (and sometimes head-spinningly confusing!). He had a big impact on us at Radiolab.  For Jad, his Joe Frank moment happened in 2002, while sitting at a mixing console in an AM radio studio waiting to read the weather.  Joe Frank's Peabody Award-winning series "Rent-A-Family” came on the air.</p>

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, we spoke with Walter F. Rutkowski about how the Carnegie Hero Fund selects its heroes, an honor the fund bestows upon ordinary people who have done extraordinary acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When some of these heroes were asked what they were thinking when they leapt into action, they replied: they didn’t think about it, they just went in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky says there is a certain kind of empathy that leads to action. But feeling the pain of another person deeply is not necessarily what makes a hero.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our original episode was reported and produced by Lynn Levy and Tim Howard. This update was produced by Amanda Aronczyk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, our producers pick up a few of the questions that spilled out of that bucket, and venture out into the great unknown to find answers to some of life's greatest mysteries: coincidences; miracles; life; death; fate; will; and, of course, poop.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/super-cool-2017/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When we started reporting a fantastic, surreal story about one very cold night, more than 70 years ago, in northern Russia, we had no idea we'd end up thinking about cosmology. Or dropping toy horses in test tubes of water. Or talking about bacteria. Or arguing, for a year. Walter Murch (aka, the Godfather of &lt;em&gt;The Godfather&lt;/em&gt;), joined by a team of scientists, leads us on what felt like the magical mystery tour of super cool science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our supercooling demonstration (with a tiny horse):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="user-embedded-video"&gt;&lt;div id="videoplayer_idm140432475244272935bfbbf-dd0a-4909-8ae3-993fadc45471"&gt;&lt;iframe width="300" height="169" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8HmyLwcYnw?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;autohide=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;feature=oembed&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" id="a-653083126755228439" class="youtube_video" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" data-original-url="http://youtu.be/U8HmyLwcYnw"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/jad-grows-ice-with-one-finger" target="_blank"&gt;Jad grows ice, with one finger (sorta)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/flash-freeze-high-def/" target="_blank"&gt;A flash freezing, in high-def&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it turns out, our podcast &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/radiolab-physicists-on-the-same-wavelength/" target="_blank"&gt;has something to do with this pret-ty big physics discovery&lt;/a&gt;, about possibly one of the earliest supercooling events in the universe, moments after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was produced by Molly Webster and Matt Kielty with help from Amanda Aronczyk. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; It originally aired in March of 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On a fall afternoon in 1984, Dethorne Graham ran into a convenience store for a bottle of orange juice. Minutes later he was unconscious, injured, and in police handcuffs. In this episode, we explore a case that sent two Charlotte lawyers on a quest for true objectivity, and changed the face of policing in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But the big surprise was that he could make that effect disappear with just a few simple changes in language.

You might save a life… or you might be magically transported across a cultural chasm and find yourself starring in a modern adaptation of the greatest story ever told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, without thinking much of it, Jennell Jenney swabbed her cheek and signed up to be a donor.  Across the country, Jim Munroe desperately needed a miracle, a one-in-eight-million connection that would save him. It proved to be a match made in marrow, a bit of magic in the world that hadn’t been there before.  But when Jennell and Jim had a heart-to-heart in his suburban Dallas backyard, they realized they had contradictory ideas about where that magic came from. Today, an allegory for how to walk through the world in a way that lets you be deeply different, but totally together. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/oliver-sacks-journey-where-to-where/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s nothing quite like the sound of someone thinking out loud, struggling to find words and ideas to match what’s in their head. Today, we are allowed to dip into the unfiltered thoughts of Oliver Sacks, one of our heroes, in the last months of his life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Oliver died in 2015, but before he passed he and his partner Bill Hayes, in an effort to preserve some of Oliver’s thoughts on his work and his life, bought a little tape recorder. Over a year and half after Oliver’s death, Bill dug up the recorder and turned it on. Through snippets of conversation with Bill, and in moments Oliver recorded whispering to himself as he wrote, we get a peek inside the head, and the life, of one of the greatest science essayists of all time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The passages read in this piece all come from Oliver’s recently released, posthumous book, &lt;a href="https://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/the-river-of-consciousness/"&gt;The River of Consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we are allowed to dip into the unfiltered thoughts of Oliver Sacks, one of our heroes, in the last months of his life. </p>
<p class="p2">Oliver died in 2015, but before he passed he and his partner Bill Hayes, in an effort to preserve some of Oliver’s thoughts on his work and his life, bought a little tape recorder. Over a year and half after Oliver’s death, Bill dug up the recorder and turned it on. Through snippets of conversation with Bill, and in moments Oliver recorded whispering to himself as he wrote, we get a peek inside the head, and the life, of one of the greatest science essayists of all time.</p>
<p class="p2"><em>The passages read in this piece all come from Oliver’s recently released, posthumous book, <a href="https://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/the-river-of-consciousness/">The River of Consciousness</a>. </em></p>

&lt;p&gt;Khader El-Yateem is a Palestinian American running for office in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, one of the most divided, and most conservative neighborhoods in New York City. To win, he'll need to convince a wildly diverse population that he can speak for all of them, and he'll need to pull one particular group of people, Arab American Muslims, out of the shadows and into the political process.

&lt;p&gt;What happens when the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, seems to get it wrong? &lt;em&gt;Korematsu v. United States &lt;/em&gt;is a case that’s been widely denounced and discredited, but it still remains on the books. This is the case that upheld President Franklin Roosevelt’s internment of American citizens during World War II based solely on their Japanese heritage, for the sake of national security. In this episode, we follow Fred Korematsu’s path to the Supreme Court, and we ask the question: if you can’t get justice in the Supreme Court, can you find it someplace else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us would sacrifice one person to save five. It’s a pretty straightforward bit of moral math. But if we have to actually kill that person ourselves, the math gets fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the lesson of the classic Trolley Problem, a moral puzzle that fried our brains in an episode we did about 11 years ago. Luckily, the Trolley Problem has always been little more than a thought experiment, mostly confined to conversations at a certain kind of cocktail party. That is until now. New technologies are forcing that moral quandry out of our philosophy departments and onto our streets. So today we revisit the Trolley Problem and wonder how a two-ton hunk of speeding metal will make moral calculations about life and death that we can’t even figure out ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/oliver-sipple/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One morning, Oliver Sipple went out for a walk. A couple hours later, to his own surprise, he saved the life of the President of the United States. But in the days that followed, Sipple’s split-second act of heroism turned into a rationale for making his personal life into political opportunity. What happens next makes us wonder what a moment, or a movement, or a whole society can demand of one person. And how much is too much? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Through newly unearthed archival tape, we hear Sipple himself grapple with some of the most vexing topics of his day and ours - privacy, identity, the freedom of the press - not to mention the bonds of family and friendship. &lt;/p&gt;

We hear from some moon-peeping listeners and then, on the 40th anniversary of their launch, we check in with the Voyager space probes. We revisit the story of the romantic time capsules that were placed onboard, and a question we asked five years ago: where exactly is Voyager 1? &lt;/p&gt;

It's an undertaking that involves some of the most elaborate security and cryptography ever done (so we've been told). And math. Lots of math. It was all going great until, in the middle of it, something started to behave a little...strangely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reported by Molly Webster. Produced by Matt Kielty and Molly Webster. Denver Ceremony station recordings were created by media maker Nathaniel Kramer, with help from Daniel Cooper. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On the winding canals in the hidden parts of Venice, we learn about the nearly 1000-year old tradition of the Venetian Gondolier, and how the global media created a 20-year battle between that tradition and a supposed feminist icon.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;*** As of Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017 we've run out of kits. Thanks so much to uBiome for generously donating over 13,000 free kits, and thanks to everyone for participating. ***&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="who"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who is uBiome?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uBiome is a California-based biotech company started in 2012 that sequences the DNA of the microbes that live on and in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="pay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do I have to pay for my results?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, as long as you use the code for Radiolab/Only Human listeners, the sequencing results are free! uBiome otherwise charges $89 to have a skin sample analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name="sick"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I going to find out if I’m sick?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uBiome information isn’t for diagnosing any health condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a name="long"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long will it take to get my results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can take from 3-6 weeks from when uBiome receives your sample to sequence, process and compile the material. So please send those samples back to the uBiome labs soon, so we can report back to you about the Radiolab/Only Human group.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a name="data"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is uBiome going to do with my microbiome info?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uBiome scientists are going to share aggregate level analysis with Radiolab and Only Human so we can give general results about our group’s skin microbiome. Aside from that, what uBiome does with your results generally depends on whether you choose to be included in research or share your information. uBiome is HIPAA-compliant, and their practices are reviewed by an independent committee for ethical research (an IRB). For more information, see uBiome’s summary of &lt;a href="https://ubiome.com/doc/privacy-notice"&gt;its privacy practices&lt;/a&gt; (just 6 pages in regular-sized font).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a name="download"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will I be able to get my raw data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! Once your results are in, you’ll be able to download it as a CSV, JSON or FASTQ file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name="clone"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will they take my DNA and clone me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If by “me”, you mean the human you, then no, uBiome isn’t going to clone, let alone even sequence human DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

FAQ:
<p><a name="who"></a><em>Who is uBiome?</em></p>
<p>uBiome is a California-based biotech company started in 2012 that sequences the DNA of the microbes that live on and in you.</p>
<p><a name="pay"></a><em>Do I have to pay for my results?</em></p>
<p>No, as long as you use the code for Radiolab/Only Human listeners, the sequencing results are free! uBiome otherwise charges $89 to have a skin sample analyzed.</p>
<p><a name="sick"></a><em>Am I going to find out if I’m sick?</em></p>
<p>This uBiome information isn’t for diagnosing any health condition.</p>
<p><em><a name="long"></a>How long will it take to get my results?</em></p>
<p>It can take from 3-6 weeks from when uBiome receives your sample to sequence, process and compile the material. So please send those samples back to the uBiome labs soon, so we can report back to you about the Radiolab/Only Human group.   </p>
<p><em><a name="data"></a>What is uBiome going to do with my microbiome info?</em></p>
<p>uBiome scientists are going to share aggregate level analysis with Radiolab and Only Human so we can give general results about our group’s skin microbiome. Aside from that, what uBiome does with your results generally depends on whether you choose to be included in research or share your information. uBiome is HIPAA-compliant, and their practices are reviewed by an independent committee for ethical research (an IRB). For more information, see uBiome’s summary of <a href="https://ubiome.com/doc/privacy-notice">its privacy practices</a> (just 6 pages in regular-sized font).</p>
<p><em><a name="download"></a>Will I be able to get my raw data?</em></p>
<p>Yes! Once your results are in, you’ll be able to download it as a CSV, JSON or FASTQ file.</p>
<p><a name="clone"></a><em>Will they take my DNA and clone me?</em></p>
<p>If by “me”, you mean the human you, then no, uBiome isn’t going to clone, let alone even sequence human DNA.</p>

Could you refuse the order?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode, we profile one Air Force Major who asked that question back in the 1970s and learn how the very act of asking it was so dangerous it derailed his career. We also pick up the question ourselves and pose it to veterans both high and low on the nuclear chain of command. Their responses reveal once and for all whether there are any legal checks and balances between us and a phone call for Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/update-crispr/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's been almost two years since we learned about CRISPR, a ninja-assassin-meets-DNA-editing-tool that has been billed as one of the most powerful, and potentially controversial, technologies ever discovered by scientists. In this episode, we catch up on what's been happening (it's a lot), and learn about CRISPR's potential to not only change human evolution, but every organism on the entire planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out drinking with a few biologists, Jad finds out about something called CRISPR. No, it’s not a robot or the latest dating app, it’s a method for genetic manipulation that is rewriting the way we change DNA. Scientists say they’ll someday be able to use CRISPR to fight cancer and maybe even bring animals back from the dead. Or, pretty much do whatever you want.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-presents-ponzi-supernova/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We thought we knew the story of Bernie Madoff.  How he masterminded the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, leaving behind scores of distraught investors and a $65 billion black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we had never heard the story from Madoff himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, reporter Steve Fishman and former Radiolabber Ellen Horne visit our studio to play us snippets from their extraordinary Audible series &lt;em&gt;Ponzi Supernova&lt;/em&gt;, which features exclusive footage of the man who bamboozled the world.  After years of investigative reporting – including interviews with dozens of FBI and SEC agents, investors, traders, and attorneys – the pair scrutinize Madoff’s account to understand exactly why he did it, how he managed to pull it off, and how culpable he actually was. Was he a puppetmaster or a puppet? And if the latter, who else is to blame for the biggest financial fraud in history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ponzi-supernova/id1232020925?mt=2"&gt;You can hear the entire series on iTunes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FREE-Ponzi-Supernova/dp/B06Y4F5JLT"&gt;for free on Audible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Miller. After pulling it out and inspecting it, he realized this raccoon was from the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe, and unlike anything he’d ever seen before.  He christened it &lt;em&gt;Procyon minor&lt;/em&gt; and in doing so changed the history of Guadeloupe forever.  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we travel from the storage rooms of the Smithsonian to the sandy beaches of Guadeloupe, chasing the tale of this trash can tipping critter. All the while trying to uncover what it means to be special. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Sally Stainier and Allie Pinel for all their help translating in Guadeloupe and New York respectively. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-presents-media-busted-americas-poverty-myths/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We love to share great radio, even if we didn’t make it. Today, On the Media’s Brooke Gladstone tells Jad and Robert about a mammoth project they launched to take a critical look at the tales we tell ourselves when we talk about poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 5-part series called "Busted: America’s Poverty Myths,” On the Media picked apart numerous oft-repeated narratives about what it's like to be poor in America. From Ben Franklin to a brutal eviction, Brooke gives us just a little taste of what she learned and shares a couple stories of the struggle to get ahead, or even just get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go check out the full series, it’s well worth it. You can &lt;a href="http://www.wnyc.org/series/busted-americas-poverty-myths"&gt;hear all 5 episodes of Busted here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/on-the-media/id73330715?mt=2"&gt;subscribe to On the Media in iTunes&lt;/a&gt; (or wherever you get your podcasts) to listen to this series or all their other great work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Busted: America’s Poverty Myths" was produced by Meara Sharma and Eve Claxton and edited by Katya Rogers. They produced the series in collaboration with WNET’s Chasing the Dream; poverty and opportunity in America.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bringing-gamma-back/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, a startling new discovery: prodding the brain with light, a group of scientists got an unexpected surprise -- they were able to turn back on a part of the brain that had been shut down by Alzheimer’s disease. This new science is not a cure, and is far from a treatment, but it’s a finding so … simple, you won’t be able to shake it. Come join us for a lab visit, where we’ll meet some mice, stare at some light, and come face-to-face with the mystery of memory. We can promise you: by the end, you’ll never think the same way about Christmas lights again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was reported by Molly Webster. It was produced by Annie McEwen, Matt Kielty, and Molly Webster, with help from Simon Adler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Ed Boyden, Cognito Therapeutics, Brad Dickerson, Karen Duff, Zaven Khachaturian, Michael Lutz, Kevin M. Spencer, and Peter Uhlhaas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Producer's note about the image:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those neon green things in the image are microglia, the brain’s immune cells, or, as we describe them in our episode, the janitor cells of the brain. Straight from MIT’s research files, this image shows microglia who have gotten light stimulation therapy (one can only hope in the flicker room). You can see their many, super-long tentacles, which would be used to feel out anything that didn’t belong in the brain. And then they’d eat it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our first-ever election special, we set off to find a single vote that made a difference. We venture from the biggest election on the planet - where polling officials must brave a lion-inhabited forest to collect the vote of an ascetic temple priest - to the smallest election on the planet - where there are no polling officials, only kitty cats wearing nametags. Along the way, we meet a too-trusting advice columnist, a Texan Emperor, and a passive-aggressive mom who helped change American democracy forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as long as she can remember, Amy Pearl has loved meat in all its glorious cuts and marbled flavors. And then one day, for seemingly no reason, her body wouldn’t tolerate it.  No steaks. No brisket. No weenies.  It made no sense to her or to her doctor: why couldn’t she eat something that she had routinely enjoyed for decades? Something our evolutionary forebears have eaten since time immemorial?  The answer involves mysterious maps, interpretive dance, and a collision of three different species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/seneca-nebraska/</link><description>&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;Back in 2014 the town of Seneca, Nebraska was deeply divided. How divided? They were so fed up with each other that some citizens began circulating a petition that proposed a radical solution. If a majority wanted to they'd self-destruct, end the town and wipe their community off the map. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producer Simon Adler goes to Seneca to knock on doors and sit down with residents for a series of kitchen table conversations. Along the way, we try to piece together what happened in this tiny town and what its fracture says about America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced and Reported by Simon Adler. &lt;span&gt;Special Thanks to Matthew Hansen of the Omaha World Herald.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/primitive-streak/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last May, two research groups announced a breakthrough: they each grew human embryos, in the lab, longer than ever before. In doing so, they witnessed a period of human development no one had ever seen. But in the process, they crashed up against something called the '14-day rule,' a guideline set over 30 years ago that dictates what we do, and possibly how we feel, about human embryos in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this episode, join producer Molly Webster as she peers down at our very own origins, and wonders: what do we do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was produced by Molly Webster and Annie McEwen, with help from Matt Kielty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks goes to the Bioethics Research Library at Georgetown University; Omar Sultan Haque, Kevin Fitzgerald, SJ, and Josephine Johnston; Charlie McCarthy; Elizabeth Lockett, Mark Hill, and Robert Cork; plus, Eric Boodman, Lauren Morello, and Martin Pera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Producer's note about the image:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the super cool picture that's running with this piece. Scientist Gist Croft sent it to me a couple of weeks after my visit to the Rockefeller lab: it’s an image of the very embryo I looked at under the microscope - a twelve-day old human embryo - but with all the detail highlighted using fluorescent dye. (When I looked in person, we were using a light microscope that showed everything in black and white, with not nearly that precision.) The neon green bits are what's called the epiblast, the clump of cells from which the entire human body develops. See how it looks like it's pulling apart in to two? The scientists don’t know for sure, but they think this embryo might have been on it's way to becoming TWO embryos. Twinning! In action!&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/update-eye-sky/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;An update on Ross McNutt and his superpower — he can zoom in on everyday life, then rewind and fast-forward to solve crimes in a shutter-flash. But should he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2004, when casualties in Iraq were rising due to roadside bombs, Ross McNutt and his team came up with an idea. With a small plane and a 44 mega-pixel camera, they figured out how to watch an entire city all at once, all day long. Whenever a bomb detonated, they could zoom onto that spot and then, because this eye in the sky had been there all along, they could scroll back in time and see - literally see - who planted it. After the war, Ross McNutt retired from the Air Force, and brought this technology back home with him. Manoush Zomorodi and Alex Goldmark from the podcast “Note to Self” give us the lowdown on Ross’s unique brand of persistent surveillance, from Juarez, Mexico to Dayton, Ohio. Then, once we realize what we can do, we wonder whether we should.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/invisible-girl/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s episode, we meet a young woman from Texas, born and raised, who can’t prove that she exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alecia Faith Pennington was born at home, homeschooled, and never visited a dentist or a hospital. By both chance and design she is completely invisible in the eyes of the state. We follow Faith as she struggles to free herself from one restrictive world only to find that she is trapped in another. In her journey to prove her American citizenship she attempts to answer the age-old question: who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reported and produced by Alexandra Leigh Young. Produced by Andy Mills and Brenna Farrell. Special thanks to Savannah Escobar, Nick Reed, Chris Van Deusen, David Glenn, Zen Allegra, Russell Whelan, Rachel Coleman and Lake Travis Zipline Adventures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this episode's web copy incorrectly stated that Faith Pennington was born on a farm. Pennington was born at home in Houston, TX, then she and her family moved to a farm in Kerrville, TX, where she was raised. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this story, a dog introduces us to a strange creature that burrows beneath forests, building an underground network where deals are made and lives are saved (and lost) in a complex web of friendships, rivalries, and business relations. It’s a network that scientists are only just beginning to untangle and map, and it’s not only turning our understanding of forests upside down, it’s leading some researchers to rethink what it means to be intelligent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified naturalist David Attenborough as his late brother, actor Richard Attenborough. In addition, it dated the earliest scientific studies of fungi to the late 19th century, whereas naturalists have studied fungi since the 17th century. Lastly, we mistakenly stated that the oxygen that a plant respires comes from CO2, when in reality it comes from water. The audio has been adjusted to correct these facts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He had been kicked out of college, was cleaning toilets by day, delivering pizzas by night and spending his weekends in jail. Then one night he heard a story on the radio and got it in his head that maybe he too could make a great radio story. He’d cast himself as the main character in a great documentary and he’d travel and &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; and steer his way out of his rut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he bought a recorder and began to secretly record every last meaningful and mundane minute of his life and he found his great idea transformed into a troubling obsession. The very thing that gave him hope and purpose was also distancing him from those he loved the most. What if he’d created an archive of his life that had become his life?&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/more-perfect-plaintiffs/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the court decided one of this term’s blockbuster cases — a case that could affect the future of affirmative action in this country. The plaintiff was Abigail Fisher, a white woman, who said she was rejected from the University of Texas because the university unfairly considered race as one of many factors when evaluating applicants. And while Fisher’s claims were the focus of the case, the story behind how she ended up in front of the Supreme Court is a lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://media2.wnyc.org/i/304/423/l/80/1/imageedit_1_5483384188.jpg" alt=""&gt;

&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Edward Blum is the director of the Project on Fair Representation&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="image-credit"&gt;(AEI) &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this episode, we visit Edward Blum, a 64-year-old “legal entrepreneur” and former stockbroker who has become something of a Supreme Court matchmaker — He takes an issue, finds the perfect plaintiff, matches them with lawyers, and works his way to the highest court in the land. He’s had remarkable success, with 6 cases heard before the Supreme Court, including that of Abigail Fisher. We also head to Houston, Texas, where in 1998, an unusual 911 call led to one of the most important LGBT rights decisions in the Supreme Court’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/the_political_thicket/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from Radiolab's first ever spin-off podcast, More Perfect.

&lt;p&gt;When Chief Justice Earl Warren was asked at the end of his career, “What was the most important case of your tenure?”, there were a lot of answers he could have given. After all, he had presided over some of the most important decisions in the court’s history — cases that dealt with segregation in schools, the right to an attorney, the right to remain silent, just to name a few. But his answer was a surprise: He said, “Baker v. Carr,” a 1962 redistricting case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this episode of &lt;em&gt;More Perfect&lt;/em&gt;, we talk about why this case was so important; important enough, in fact, that it pushed one Supreme Court justice to a nervous breakdown, brought a boiling feud to a head, put one justice in the hospital, and changed the course of the Supreme Court — and the nation — forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It starts with a sound, rising like a mist from the marsh, around a dock in South Carolina. But where it goes next - from submarines to superheroes (and yes, Keanu Reeves!); from the surface of the sun to the middle of the brain - is far from expected. Producer Molly Webster brings her family along for the ride. Enjoy the adventure, before it...implodes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanna see the shrimp bubble in super slowmo? Check it out&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg10Et8FEWc"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; (and note, of the 1,400 views on this video, producer Molly Webster probably comprises 752).&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see cavitation bubbles form, and think you might enjoy watching it happen in French, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RR6J-yOyT48?t=3m44s"&gt;check this out&lt;/a&gt; - the high frame rate makes these shots divine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger Better Bubbles &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Dave Stein, soap bubbles were round, smallish, and collapsed with a pop. Now, they are anything but. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we explore the story of one man, who - in an instant, changed the art of bubble blowing and what it means to be a bubble forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Simon Adler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Megan Colby Parker, Gary Pearlman, David Erk, Rick Findley and everyone who came out to blow giant bubbles with us in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surya Bonaly was not your typical figure skater.  She was black. She was athletic. And she didn’t seem to care about artistry.  Her performances – punctuated by triple-triple jumps and other power moves – thrilled audiences around the world.  Yet, commentators claimed she couldn’t skate, and judges never gave her the high marks she felt she deserved.  But Surya didn’t accept that criticism.  Unlike her competitors – ice princesses who hid behind demure smiles – Surya made her feelings known.  And, at her final Olympic performance, she attempted one jump that flew in the face of the establishment, and marked her for life as a rebel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we lace up our skates and tell a story about loving a sport that doesn’t love you back, and being judged in front of the world according to rules you don’t understand. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/update-23-weeks-6-days/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;An update on Juniper French, a tiny baby, born at 23 Weeks and 6 days -- roughly halfway to full term. And a whole universe of medical and moral questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology has had a profound effect on how we get pregnant, give birth, and think about life and death. The decision to become parents was not an easy one for Kelley and Tom. Even after they sorted out their relationship issues and hopes for the future, getting pregnant wasn't easy. But, thanks to a lot of technology, they found a way to a baby. Then, about halfway through the pregnancy, the trouble began. Neonatal nurse practitioner Diane Loisel describes helping Kelley and Tom make the most important decision of their lives. And Nita Farahany helps Jad and Robert understand the significance of viability, and how technology has influenced its meaning...making a difficult idea even harder to pin down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kelley and Tom had hoped that meeting their daughter would be the happiest moment of their life. But when she came early -- at just 23 weeks and 6 days, that moment was full of terror and an impossibly difficult decision. And when the time came to face it, Tom and Kelley turned to their baby for help. Seeing their daughter for the first time, they looked for her to "declare herself." That's a phrase that comes up again and again to help guide decisions in Neonatal Intensive Care Units. But parents and medical professionals have very different ideas about what the phrase really means. Nurse Tracy Hullet and Neonatologist Keith Barrington describe the difficulty of interpreting the fuzzy boundary between a baby's strength of will, and simple physiology. Meanwhile Kelley and Tom are left to wonder, and wait.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, or NICU, is a land of emotional and medical limbo. Kelley, Tom, and their daughter Juniper got stranded in this limbo for months, fighting to survive, and finally get to the next chapter of their lives. Their doctor, Fauzia Shakeel, describes the moment when Juniper's life hung in the balance, and Keith Barrington helps us understand how our newest technologies open the door not only to hope, but also to a pain that we, as humans, have kept hidden for most of our history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, Kelley, Tom, Nita Farahany and Juniper herself, nearly 5 years old, give us an update on her life and what has happened since our story originally aired. &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/kpoparazzi/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., paparazzi are pretty much synonymous with invasion of privacy. But today we travel to a place where the prying press create something more like a prison break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K-pop is a global juggernaut - with billions in sales and millions of fans hanging on every note, watching K-pop idols synchronize and strut. And that fame rests on a fantasy, K-pop stars have to be chaste and pure, but also … available. Until recently, Korean music agencies and K-pop fans held their pop stars to a strict set of rules designed to keep that fantasy alive. That is, until Dispatch showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a cue from American and British paparazzi, a group of South Korean reporters started hiding in their cars and snapping photos of stars on their secret dates. The first-ever paparazzi photos turned the world of K-pop upside down and introduced sort of a puzzle … how much do you want to know about the people you idolize, and when is enough enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Matthew Kielty and Alexandra Young. Reported by Alexandra Young with Brenna Farrell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special Thanks to Dispatch, Haeryun Kang, Joseph Kim, Charlie Cho, Hyena, Crayon Pop, Jeremy Bloom, The Kirukkiruk Guesthouse, Choi Baekseol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Jiin Choi, David Bevan, and The One Shots. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan and Amy Green were facing the unfaceable: their youngest son, Joel was diagnosed with terminal cancer after his first birthday. Producer Sruthi Pinnamaneni tells the story of how Ryan and Amy stumble onto an unlikely way of processing their experience fighting alongside Joel: they decide to turn it into a video game. In the end, they find themselves facing what might be, for a game designer or a parent, the hardest design problem ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: In the original audio we stated that the survival rate of childhood AT/RT cancer is 50% over five years. But studies suggest the survival rate is 50% over two years. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The audio has been updated to reflect this change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode we take a sober look at the throbbing, aching, craving desire states that return people (again and again) to the object of their addiction … and the pills that just might set them free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporter Amy O’Leary was fed up with her ex-boyfriend’s hard-drinking, when she discovered a French doctor’s memoir titled &lt;em&gt;The End of My Addiction&lt;/em&gt;.  The fix that he proposed seemed too good to be true.  But her phone call with the doctor left her, and us, even more intrigued. Could this malady – so often seen as moral and spiritual - really be beaten back with a pill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk to addiction researcher Dr. Anna Rose Childress, a&lt;span&gt;ddiction psychologist&lt;/span&gt; Dr. Mark Willenbring, journalist Gabrielle Glaser, The National Institute of Health’s Dr. Nora Volkow, and scores of people dealing with substance abuse as we try to figure out whether we're in the midst of a sea change in how we think about addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Reporter Amy O’Leary was fed up with her ex-boyfriend’s hard-drinking, when she discovered a French doctor’s memoir titled <em>The End of My Addiction</em>.  The fix that he proposed seemed too good to be true.  But her phone call with the doctor left her, and us, even more intrigued.

<p>We talk to addiction researcher Dr. Anna Rose Childress, addiction psychologist Dr. Mark Willenbring, journalist Gabrielle Glaser, The National Institute of Health’s Dr. Nora Volkow, and scores of people dealing with substance abuse as we try to figure out whether we're in the midst of a sea change in how we think about addiction.</p>

At the time we published this podcast, we had not properly determined the extent of their role in finding and developing this story. As a result, we have removed the episode from the Radiolab archive.  We did not feel a correction could rectify the problem and Radiolab honors its relationships with contributors too much to let the error remain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/update-new-normal/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An update: we revisit our episode about normalcy. Evolution results from the ability of organisms to change. But how do you tell the difference between a sea change and a ripple in the water? Is a peacenik baboon, a man in a dress, or a cuddly fox a sign of things to come? Or just a flukey outlier from the norm? And is there ever really a norm? This episode we return to two stories where choice has challenged destiny to see what's changed and what has become deeply normal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But as the show succeeded, it started to change the way we thought not only of reality television, but also of reality itself.  Looking back at the show now, a half century later, it’s hard NOT to see so many of our preoccupations – privacy, propriety, publicity, authenticity – through a funhouse mirror, darkly.&lt;/p&gt;

Cyber criminals today have more sophisticated tools, have learned to work collaboratively around the world and have found innovative ways to remain deep undercover in the internet's shadows. This episode, we shine a light into those shadows to see the world from the perspectives of both cybercrime victims and perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we meet mother-daughter duo Alina and Inna Simone, who tell us about being held hostage by criminals who have burrowed into their lives from half a world away. Along the way we learn about the legally sticky spot that unwitting accomplices like Will Wheeler find themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then reporter and author Joseph Menn tells us about the surprisingly lucrative professional hacker structure in places throughout the former Soviet Union. Finally, the co-creator of one of the most notorious online marketplaces to ever exist speaks to us and NPR cyber-crime expert Dina Temple-Raston about how a young suburban Boy Scout can turn into a world renowned black hat hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/rhino-hunter/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 for a hunting trip to Namibia to shoot and kill an endangered species.  He’s a professional hunter, who guides hunts all around the world, so going to Africa would be nothing new.  The target on the other hand would be. And so too, he quickly found, would be the attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode, producer Simon Adler follows Corey as he dodges death threats and prepares to pull the trigger.  Along the way we stop to talk with Namibian hunters and government officials, American activists, and someone who's been here before - Kenya’s former Director of Wildlife, Richard Leakey.   All the while, we try to uncover what conservation really means in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reported &amp;amp; produced by Simon Adler with production help from Matthew Kielty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/remembering-oliver-sacks/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In memory of one of our dear friends and one of the truest inspirations for Radiolab, a re-release of the last conversation we had with Dr. Oliver Sacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Radiolab was just starting out, Robert asked &lt;a href="http://www.oliversacks.com/"&gt;Dr. Oliver Sacks&lt;/a&gt; if he could help us, maybe send us a few story ideas. Over the years he has shared with us stories of chemistry, music, neurology, hallucinations and more, so much more. Because Oliver notices the world and the people around him with scientific rigor, with insight, and most importantly, with deep empathy. ‪When he announced a few months ago that he had terminal cancer and wasn't going to do any more interviews, we asked him if he'd talk with us one last time. He said yes‬. So Robert went, as he has done for 30 some years now, to his apartment with a microphone, this time to ask him about the forces that have driven him in his work, in his unique relationships with his patients, and in his own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This performance was scored live by the incomparable Sarah Lipstate/Noveller. &lt;a href="http://www.sarahlipstate.com/"&gt;Her new album Fantastic Planet is out now. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lullabies you hear in "Dr. Sacks Looks Back" are sung by Carrie Erving, whose current project is &lt;a href="http://www.ponyhofmusic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Ponyhof&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though it probably goes without saying, &lt;a href="http://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/on-the-move/"&gt;we highly recommend Dr. Sacks' new autobiorgraphy, On The Move. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/mau-mau/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a few documents that tumbled out of the secret archives of the biggest empire the world has ever known, offering a glimpse of histories waiting to be rewritten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just down the road from a pub in rural Hanslope Park, England is a massive building — the secret archives of the biggest empire the world has ever known. This is the story of a few documents that tumbled out and offered a glimpse of histories waiting to be rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When professor Caroline Elkins came across a stray document left by the British colonial government in Nairobi, Kenya, she opened the door to a new reckoning with the history of one of Britain's colonial crown jewels, and the fearsome group of rebels known as the Mau Mau. We talk to historians, archivists, journalists and send our producer Jamie York to visit the Mau Mau. As the new history of Kenya is concealed and revealed, document by document, we wonder what else lies in wait among the miles of records hidden away in Hanslope Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced by Matt Kielty with reporting from Jamie York&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this episode contained two errors, which we have corrected. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first was our mention of Israel as a former British colony where official documents were purged. In fact, Israel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt; was a successor to the British mandated territory of Palestine, which we also listed, and so we removed the redundancy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second was that we qualified our statement about Kikuyu support for the Mau Mau. Some listeners misinterpreted our claim that support for the Mau Mau cut across all demographics among the Kikuyu to mean that all Kikuyu supported the Mau Mau, which is untrue. We tempered the language in that spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2004, when casualties in Iraq were rising due to roadside bombs, Ross McNutt and his team came up with an idea. With a small plane and a 44 mega-pixel camera, they figured out how to watch an entire city all at once, all day long. Whenever a bomb detonated, they could zoom onto that spot and then, because this eye in the sky had been there all along, they could scroll back in time and see - literally see - who planted it. After the war, Ross McNutt retired from the airforce, and brought this technology back home with him. Manoush Zomorodi and Alex Goldmark from the podcast “Note to Self” give us the low-down on Ross’s unique brand of persistent surveillance, from Juarez, Mexico to Dayton, Ohio. Then, once we realize what we can do, we wonder whether we should.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-live-telltale-hearts-featuring-oliver-sacks/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago Radiolab performed a live show and this episode we're bringing you a few of the highlights. They were stories of what motivates us, our drives, our loves and losses. Producer Molly Webster tells us the story of life, near-death and what happens when your heart starts to work against you.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/football/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;Today, we tackle football. It’s the most popular sport in the US, shining a sometimes harsh light on so much of what we have been, what we are, and what we hope to be. Savage, creative, brutal and balletic, whether you love it or loathe it … it’s a touchstone of the American identity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with conflicted parents and players and coaches who aren’t sure if the game will survive, we take a deep dive into the surprising history of how the game came to be. At the end of the 19th century, football is a nascent and nasty sport.&lt;/span&gt; The sons of the most powerful men in the country are literally knocking themselves out to win these gladiatorial battles. But then the Carlisle Indian School, formed in 1879 to assimilate the children and grandchildren of the Native American men who fought the final Plains Wars, fields the most American team of all. The kids at Carlisle took the field to face off against a new world that was destroying theirs, and along the way, they changed the fundamentals of football forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this episode included a few errors that we have corrected. We've also added one new piece of information. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;The piece originally stated that British football had no referees.  While this was true in the earliest days of British football, they were eventually added. We stated that referees were added to American football in response to Pop Warner. American referees existed prior to Pop Warner, in order to address brutality as well as the kind of rule-bending that Pop Warner specialized in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chuck Klosterman said that the three most popular sports in the US are football, college football and major league baseball. In fact, baseball actually ranks 2nd, college football is third.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monet Edwards stated that 33 members of her family were players in the NFL. That number is actually 13. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;We also added one new fact: over 200 students at The Carlisle Indian School died of malnutrition, poor health or distress from homesickness. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;The audio has been adjusted to reflect these corrections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

NPR's Invisibilia's originally included Paige's birth name in this piece due to a miscommunication between Invisibilia's reporter, Alix Spiegel and Paige. We have not been in contact with Paige directly, but NPR has issued t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;he following statement from Anne Gudenkauf, senior supervising editor of NPR's science desk: "We would never have violated Paige’s wishes in this story; it’s an unfortunate misunderstanding.  Invisibilia's upcoming episode on Paige will be edited to remove references to the name she no longer recognizes. Also the upcoming episode, which focuses on how categories affect us all, will explore in more depth the changes in Paige's life over the two years that she and Alix have spoken and will do that, as always, with attention to bi-gender and transgender reporting guidelines."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Former Radiolab producer Lulu Miller and NPR reporter Alix Spiegel come to the studio to give us a sneak peak of their new show, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/"&gt;Invisibilia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Invisibilia has an upcoming episode about categories, so Alix tells us a story about two very basic categories: boy and girl. We've heard lots of stories about the sometimes blurry boundaries between boy and girl, but Alix introduces us to someone who experiences those categories in a way that was totally, completely new to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;We start with the story of perhaps the most iconic Patient Zero of all time: Typhoid Mary.

He lost both his parents to cancer. So Dennis was left, back in the house, alone. Until one night when a group of paranormal investigators showed up at his door and made him realize what it really means for a house, or a man, to be haunted.&lt;/p&gt;

That's the question poking at our ribs this hour, as we wonder how it is that the right words can have the wrong meanings, and why sometimes the best translations lead us to an understanding that's way deeper than language. This episode, 8 stories that play out in the middle space between one reality and another — where poetry, insult comedy, 911 calls, and even our own bodies work to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jad started to compose music for &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/live/"&gt;our live show Apocalyptical&lt;/a&gt;, he immediately thought of John Luther Adams. &lt;a href="http://cantaloupemusic.com/albums/become-ocean"&gt;Adams' symphony “Become Ocean&lt;/a&gt;,” rooted in the sounds of nature, is elemental, tectonic, and unstoppable. It seemed a natural fit for our consideration of the (spoiler alert) extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this piece, Jad introduces Robert to a special on Adams from a podcast called &lt;a href="http://www.wqxr.org/programs/meet-composer/"&gt;Meet the Composer&lt;/a&gt;. Through interviews and snippets of his music, it captures all the forces at play in Adam's work and reveals the dark majesty of Adams' take on the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p2"&gt;In this episode, the Suskind family finds an unlikely way to access their silent son's world. We set off to figure out what their story can tell us about Autism, a disorder with a wide spectrum of symptoms and severity.

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Today on Radiolab, a puzzle. Jad’s brother-in-law &lt;a href="http://www.zero-books.net/books/in-the-dust-of-this-planet"&gt;wrote a book called 'In The Dust of This Planet'.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/400/620/c/80/1/Cover2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;It’s an academic treatise about the horror humanity feels as we realize that we are nothing but a speck in the universe. For a few years nobody read it. But then …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/620/348/l/80/1/True_Detective.jpeg" alt=""&gt;

&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;And then on Jay-Z's back. How?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;We talk nihilism with Eugene Thacker &amp;amp; Simon Critchley, leather jackets with June Ambrose, climate change with David Victor, and hope with the father of Transcendental Black Metal - Hunter Hunt Hendrix of the band &lt;a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Liturgy/Aesthethica#.VA9NM7ywK68"&gt;Liturgy. Special thanks to Thrill Jockey&lt;/a&gt; for use of the Liturgy song 'Generation'. &lt;a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Liturgy/Aesthethica"&gt;It's from their album Aesthetica, out now, which is highly recommended listening for the end times.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this piece mistakenly identified Nic Pizzolatto as the director of True Detective, when he is in fact the creator, writer, and executive producer of the series. The audio has been adjusted to reflect this fact. Cary Fukunaga (brilliantly) directed season one of True Detective. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode, we try to make contact with some of the strangest strangers on our little planet: dolphins. Producer Lynn Levy eavesdrops on some human-dolphin conversations, from a studio apartment in the Virgin Islands to a research vessel in the Bermuda Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/happy-birthday-bobby-k/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s Robert’s birthday! (Or it was, anyway, a couple days back.) So today we celebrate with some classic Krulwich radio and a backwards peek into the spirit and sensibility that, in many ways, drives our show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his birthday surprise we all listened to some old NPR pieces that Robert did in the 70s, 80s and early 90s — a news piece on the dawn of the ATM, a fake opera on interest rates, and the story of a family business splintered into relatives fighting to be first in the phone book. Along the way, we hear some incredible stories from Robert’s life … &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just to celebrate the man whose infectious curiosity draws so many people (including us) to his side … we share with you the kind of gonzo, full-throated Krulwich story we usually can’t include in the show … an epic of secret zoos, sewing machines, an alligator farm, a marching band, and a bus full of French tourists that save the day.&lt;/p&gt;

Everybody just figured she was a crazy bird lady. But writer Jon Mooallem went to see her and discovered there was much more to this story. Mrs. Gibbs tells us her surprising side of the tale, and together with Joe Duff, we struggle with the realization that keeping things wild in today's world will be harder than we ever would’ve thought.&lt;/p&gt;
