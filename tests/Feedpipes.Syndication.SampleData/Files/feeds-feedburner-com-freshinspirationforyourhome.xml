				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While homeowners typically take on DIY projects to save money, it turns out that many of them are breaking their fixer-upper budgets and spending much more than they planned, according to a recent survey by <a href="https://porch.com/">Porch</a>. While 5% of homeowners finished their fixer-upper projects <em>under </em>budget, and 52% finished <em>on</em> budget, 44% went <em>over </em>budget.  And the homeowners who went over budget, spent, on average, 38% more than planned.</p>
<p>“One of the most common issues that can affect all of these projects is not understanding what your budget really is before you begin,” says Mick Lynch, Senior Vice President of Installations at <a href="http://powerhrg.com/">Power Home Remodeling</a> in Chester, PA. “It’s so important to set a proper budget and identify what you really need and how much those items actually cost before you start your work.”</p>
<p>In addition to having an unrealistic budget, sometimes, unexpected problems occur. The highest percentage of survey respondents named these as the projects in which they went over budget.</p>
<h2><strong>New HVAC: 54%</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_322797" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-322797 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/John-Royal-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="There’s no one-size-fits-all HVAC.

</div>
<p>The size of your house plays a role in the cost of installing a new HVAC. Homeowners often underestimate how many BTUs they’ll need to cool the house. Ductwork is another area that can increase costs. Yet another factor is the type of HVAC that’s installed. Some brands are (relatively) inexpensive, while other brands cost significantly more. In addition, installation costs vary by company. That’s why your HVAC budget shouldn’t be based on how much a co-worker or family friend paid for their system.</p>
<p>However, Nathan Outlaw, President of <a href="https://onvico.com/">Onvico</a>, a construction company in Thomasville, GA, says it’s quite possible to stay under budget. “You need to find a good company, get a firm proposal, and use a contract,” Outlaw advises.</p>
<h2><strong>Plumbing: 52%</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_322800" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-322800 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OlegDoroshin-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Plumbing components often need to be replaced. Image: " width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OlegDoroshin-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OlegDoroshin-Shutterstock-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OlegDoroshin-Shutterstock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OlegDoroshin-Shutterstock-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OlegDoroshin-Shutterstock-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Plumbing components often need to be replaced. Image: OlegDoroshin Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p><strong> </strong>“Plumbing can go over budget during repairs or remodels when issues with existing lines are found.  Sometimes old pipes start falling apart or can&#8217;t be used anymore and need to be replaced,” says Outlaw.</p>
<p>Homeowners might encounter another problem when they decide to move plumbing components around. For example, Audrey Monell, President of <a href="https://forrestanderson.net/">Forrest Anderson Plumbing and AC</a> in Phoenix, AZ, believes that you should think carefully before moving your shower. “While it will improve the overall appearance and layout of the bathroom, it will create more work and expense,” she warns. “That is because you have to move the shower drain as well, which can become a major plumbing project. If the drain is incorrectly installed or sealed, you run the risk of allowing sewer gases into your home &#8211; a serious health hazard.” Even if you’re only moving it a short distance, Monell says you will probably need to have new pipes installed or you might have serious water damage down the road.</p>
<h2><strong>Basement: 52%</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_322795" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-322795 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/David-Papazian-Shutterstock-1.jpg" alt="Basements are often dark and cold." width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/David-Papazian-Shutterstock-1.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/David-Papazian-Shutterstock-1-300x201.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/David-Papazian-Shutterstock-1-768x515.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/David-Papazian-Shutterstock-1-590x395.jpg 590w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/David-Papazian-Shutterstock-1-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Basements are often dark and cold. Image: David Papa/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>If you’re thinking about <a href="https://freshome.com/transform-basement/">transforming your basement</a>, you need to be clear on the goal of the space “If you’re remodeling it to be a fun space to hang out, that’s one project. But if you’re trying to create a entertainment lounge with a <a href="https://freshome.com/media-rooms-home-theatres/">home theatre</a>, that’s a completely different project which will require a different scope of work, and drastically increase your budget,” Lynch says.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes, homeowners don’t consider that the basement will need to be heated. “Physically heating a cool basement is a bigger task, as it usually requires infrastructure improvements to be made to the space, including the addition of ductwork or a heat source,” according to Marla Mock, VP of Operations at <a href="https://www.aireserv.com/">Air Serv Heating &amp; Air Conditioning</a>. She says you may need additional heat vents, a heated floor, or a basement-specific heating option. “But be advised that an electric space heater is not an ideal everyday solution.” Mock explains.</p>
<h2><strong>Bathrooms: 51%</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_322796" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-322796 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-Flow-SHutterstock2.jpg" alt="Trendy bathrooms can bust your budget. " width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-Flow-SHutterstock2.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-Flow-SHutterstock2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-Flow-SHutterstock2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-Flow-SHutterstock2-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Image-Flow-SHutterstock2-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Trendy bathrooms can bust your budget. Image Flow/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>“Bathrooms can frequently be affected by the ‘Pinterest Diet,’ in which homeowners begin shopping around and decide they must have what they see on imageboards,” Outlaw says. “This can turn stock vanities into custom built pieces, simple tile into intricate designs, and solid walls into glass.”</p>
<p>Lynch agrees, and says his customers get really excited when picking out items for the bathroom. “It’s fun for them to do a brief walkthrough in a home improvement store and establish their budgets based on the products they see in the store.” But then, he says they go home, do more research, and decide to start swapping out light fixtures, sinks, etc.  “Now, they find their overall total has skyrocketed, but at this point they’ve become attached to those new features and are now committed to them.”</p>
<h2><strong>New Appliances: 51%</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_322794" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-322794 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breadmaker-Shutterstock-1.jpg" alt="High-end appliances have end-end prices. " width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breadmaker-Shutterstock-1.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breadmaker-Shutterstock-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breadmaker-Shutterstock-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breadmaker-Shutterstock-1-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Breadmaker-Shutterstock-1-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">High-end appliances have end-end prices. Image: Breadmaker/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://freshome.com/nkba-kitchen-design-trends/">2019 kitchen design trends</a> can can provide inspiration – but sometimes, they also temp homeowners to spend more than they should. “Appliances generally go over budget when a homeowner goes shopping and decides they need the latest and greatest features &#8211; like maybe sending a tweet from the fridge,” Outlaw explains.</p>
<p>Another problem can occur when homeowners try to save money by shopping online for their own appliances. “If the appliances end up not working in the space, that’s wasted money,” warns Larry Greene, President of <a href="https://www.caseindy.com/">Case Design/Remodeling</a> in Carmel, IN.  “It could be helpful to clue in a remodeling firm for this step, as they&#8217;ll have helpful connections with local suppliers, saving you money on shipping and time if returns or exchanges need to be made.” In addition, Greene says a professional would be aware of common sizing mistakes and able to assist homeowners in comparing materials.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Roof: 50%</strong></h2>
<div id="attachment_322798" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-322798 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karamysh-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Your roof could be hiding numerous problems. " width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karamysh-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karamysh-Shutterstock-300x199.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karamysh-Shutterstock-768x508.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karamysh-Shutterstock-597x395.jpg 597w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Your roof could be hiding numerous problems. Image: Karamysh/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>It’s hard to guess what’s hiding under your roof, and Outlaw says that’s why roofing projects tend to go over budget. “If water has been leaking through, there could be a lot of plywood to replace. Improperly installed crickets can lead to water getting behind chimneys. Roofs become expensive when they become framing jobs,” he says.</p>
<p>Also, this is another case in which DIY efforts may be counterproductive. “Last year, we completed nearly 18,000 roofing installations, and I found time after time that homeowners first tried to complete the job themselves,” Lynch says. “But they quickly realized that they didn’t have the knowledge &#8212; or the proper tools &#8212; to finish the job, and needed to bring in professional reinforcement.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems like everyone is buying a condo or house these days. And there are tons of shows on HGTV about renovating your home making you wonder: should you rent or buy a house? Can you even afford to buy? We&#8217;re here to help you make that decision.</p>
<div id="attachment_321432" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-321432" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_312070205.jpg" alt="should I rent or buy a house?" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_312070205.jpg 800w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_312070205-300x225.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_312070205-768x577.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_312070205-526x395.jpg 526w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_312070205-162x123.jpg 162w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Ask yourself some questions before deciding if you should buy or keep on renting. Image: Dirk Ercken/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>Should You Rent Or Buy A House? Ask Yourself These Questions First</h2>
<p><strong>1. Do you plan on staying where you&#8217;re at for at least three to five years?</strong> This is an important question. If you don&#8217;t like where you live or may have to relocate for work, why buy a house? If you can&#8217;t see yourself spending at least three years in your home, you may not see any growth in your home&#8217;s value before you have to sell and move. Can&#8217;t envision yourself living in the same home or town for at least five years? You may be better off renting.</p>
<p><strong>2. Have you paid off all your debts? </strong>Make sure you&#8217;ve paid off all student loans, credit card bills and any other loans before buying a house. You&#8217;ll need to show you have a low debt-to-income ratio to qualify for a mortgage. And homeownership is scary at first. The last thing you want to worry about is covering loans, a mortgage and household expenses, too.</p>
<p><strong>3. How&#8217;s your credit score? </strong>If you plan on taking out a mortgage, a good credit score is essential. Make sure you have the best possible score <em>before</em> you start house hunting. For more info on improving your credit score, check out <a href="https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/improve-your-credit-score" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myFICO</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do you have some savings? </strong>You&#8217;re going to need a good amount of money set aside to buy a home. You&#8217;ll have to put down at least 3% as a down payment. And ideally, you&#8217;ll put down 20% to save yourself from having to pay monthly PMI (private mortgage insurance) to cover your lender if you stop paying your mortgage. You&#8217;ll also need to show you have enough money put aside in an emergency fund that would cover your mortgage and living expenses for at least three months should you lose your job.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re debt-free, settled in your location and have savings, then you may be ready to be a homeowner. Here are five reasons why it&#8217;s better to buy than rent:</p>
<div id="attachment_321433" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-321433" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_1057591310.jpg" alt="" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_1057591310.jpg 850w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_1057591310-300x212.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_1057591310-768x542.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_1057591310-560x395.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Your home is likely to grow in value over time. Image: ITTIGallery/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>1.  It&#8217;s An Investment</h2>
<p>Owning your home or condo is usually a good investment. Every payment you make on your mortgage means you&#8217;re one month closer to owning your house free and clear. And then there&#8217;s home appreciation. Your home will most likely increase in value over time. What you buy today for $250,000 could sell for $300,000 or more later.</p>
<h2>2. Tax Write-Offs</h2>
<p>Many homeownership costs are tax-deductible. By the time you write off the allowed deductions, you may pay less for owning your home than if you&#8217;d rent it. Here are some home items you can write off or deduct from your taxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Property taxes</li>
<li>Mortgage interest</li>
<li>Loan points</li>
<li>A home office</li>

<h2>3. Owning May Be Cheaper Than Renting</h2>
<p>Many major U.S. cities are hot right now, making it very expensive to rent. In a hot rental market, it may be cheaper to buy a home, especially if you can live just outside the most sought after zip codes in the area.</p>
<h2>4. Privacy</h2>
<p>Owning your own home gives you a level of privacy you don&#8217;t have when you rent. First off, no more landlord on your back. And your neighbors are hopefully removed enough that you don&#8217;t hear every little conversation (or their footsteps upstairs at midnight).</p>

<h2>5. You Can Renovate!</h2>
<p>The best part of owning your home is that you can finally apply all the skills you&#8217;ve gained watching HGTV and reading Freshome to renovate your new home. Decorate in whatever style you love. Paint the walls in any color you&#8217;d like — it&#8217;s your home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have a small space, you may think that the last thing you need is an element like a room divider, which was literally made to close off and separate spaces. But room dividers are a great addition to any small space. They are a good way to section off and organize small spaces, which often have more of an open floor plan. And open-design dividers mean that you can get a more organized space visually without closing areas off from each other completely.</p>
<p>Room dividers are also a budget design addition to a room. They can cost anywhere from $60 up. And as for time, it can take as little as a couple of hours to decide on the right divider for you, bring it home and place it in the room. So whether you are looking for a fun style accent or need to add functional organization to your space, take a look below for different ways to use room dividers.</p>
<div id="attachment_321767" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321767 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Open.jpg" alt="Room Dividers Open Design" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Open.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Open-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Open-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Open-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Open-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Visually separate a space without closing it off by going with an open room divider design. Image: New Africa/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>Visually Open Room Dividers</h2>
<p>As touched on above, room dividers don’t have to visually close off a space. The photo above shows a room divider that has an open pattern. Designs like these are perfect for adding some conceptual organization between areas in small, open-plan spaces. And they don&#8217;t make the space feel claustrophobic.</p>
<p>Designs like these also come in a wide array of patterns. A pattern like the room divider in the photo above adds some interesting geometry to the space. Other open room dividers have more curved and free-flowing patterns to them. There’s a pattern for any design taste.</p>
<div id="attachment_321768" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321768 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Rope.jpg" alt="Room Dividers Rope Design" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Rope.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Rope-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Rope-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Rope-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Rope-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Your room divider doesn’t even have to be a traditional divider. Image: Photographee.eu/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>Go Conceptual</h2>
<p>The photo above shows that a room divider can be made of just about any material. You can get creative with the types of materials you use. For instance, a simple textured wooden post and some heavy vertical rope give the appearance of a room divider in the photo above. It adds visual organization to this artsy, relaxed space without visually closing the areas off from each other.</p>
<p>The idea above also shows how you can add greenery to your room divider. The vines on the rope add more of a visual block but, again, without completely closing off the spaces. And the vines add a natural feel that matches the potted plant in the background. It’s also common to see vines added to solid room dividers.</p>
<p>If you’d like to go for a conceptual idea to separate your space, here are a few ideas for unconventional room dividers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shelving where you can see from one side to the other</li>
<li>A full clothing rack</li>
<li>Sheer tapestry or curtain</li>
<li>Open shelving with fish tanks placed on the shelves</li>
<li>A line of tall plant life</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few ideas to get those creative juices flowing.</p>
<div id="attachment_321769" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321769 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Blue.jpg" alt="Room Dividers Blue Accent" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Blue.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Blue-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Blue-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Blue-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Room-Dividers-Blue-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">A boldly colored room divider makes a great accent in a corner. Image: Africa Studio/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>Use Room Dividers as Accents</h2>
<p>It’s also common to see room dividers used as decorative accents. If you have a <a href="https://freshome.com/small-space-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smaller space</a> you’d rather not close off, think about putting a room divider in a corner. You can see the concept in action in the photo above, where a bright blue room divider adds a shock of color to an otherwise boring corner. You could do this idea with any bright <a href="https://freshome.com/2011/06/14/how-to-add-depth-to-your-interiors-with-accent-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accent color</a>, like cherry red or bright purple.</p>
<p>Also, you don’t have to stick to solid colors. There are room dividers with bold art printed on them (like this item <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/winston-porter-schatz-4-panel-room-divider-w000215926.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). And a room divider with a full art scene on it gives the optical illusion that your small space is larger since it feels like you’re looking into a window to another world.</p>
<p>And remember, take your time to weigh your options. There are many different types of room dividers out there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When searching for a new home, buyers often look for houses or land in the best neighborhoods — or, at least, the best neighborhoods that they can afford. And that’s certainly understandable. However, homeowners may be missing out on several advantages by not considering less prestigious or less desirable neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Below are six reasons to build or buy in up-and-coming areas.</p>
<div id="attachment_321426" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321426 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TDK-Visuals-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Your money goes a lot further in up-and-coming areas." width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TDK-Visuals-Shutterstock.jpg 1015w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TDK-Visuals-Shutterstock-300x177.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TDK-Visuals-Shutterstock-768x454.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/TDK-Visuals-Shutterstock-600x355.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Your money goes a lot further in up-and-coming areas. Image: TDK Visuals/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>#1: Lower price points</h2>
<p>It’s natural to want to be in an area in close proximity to popular dining, shopping and entertainment options. Even if you’re buying the home to flip it, you want to own property in a desirable area. “When you buy in the best part of town, you are paying top dollar for the property,” according to Oliver Somoza, CEO of Philadelphia-based <a href="https://turnkeypropertypro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turnkey Property Pro</a>. But when you invest in a less popular neighborhood, your buying power can go much farther.</p>
<p>“Whereas $300,000 might get you a studio apartment in the city center, it could buy you not one but two 3-bedroom houses in a growing neighborhood not too much farther away,” he says.</p>
<div id="attachment_321420" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321420 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Andy-Dean-Photography-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="You'll have more money left over for your renovation. " width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Andy-Dean-Photography-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Andy-Dean-Photography-Shutterstock-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Andy-Dean-Photography-Shutterstock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Andy-Dean-Photography-Shutterstock-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Andy-Dean-Photography-Shutterstock-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">You&#8217;ll have more money left over for your renovation. Image: Andy Dean Photography/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>#2: Personalization</h2>
<p>When you build or buy a home in an up-and-coming area, you buy at a lower price point. That means you now have the funds to create your ideal place. And that&#8217;s especially important if you purchase a <a href="https://freshome.com/buying-fixer-upper-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixer-upper that needs major repairs</a>.</p>
<p>“Now you can consider retrofits and renovations that will help you build the home that you want to be in, instead of adjusting your needs based on the space that already exists,” explains Mick Lynch, Senior Vice President of Installations at <a href="http://powerhrg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power Home Remodeling</a>. So you can install those <a href="https://freshome.com/hardwood-floors-kitchens-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardwoods in the kitchen</a> or use those <a href="https://freshome.com/brick-walls-design-element/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brick walls as a design element</a>. And there’s another bonus to being in an up-and-coming area. “You tend to have more freedom to make external renovations without worrying about zoning ordinances and other neighborhood restrictions,” he says.</p>
<div id="attachment_321417" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321417 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shelia-Fitzgerald-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Your home and neighborhood will increase in value. " width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shelia-Fitzgerald-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shelia-Fitzgerald-Shutterstock-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shelia-Fitzgerald-Shutterstock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shelia-Fitzgerald-Shutterstock-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shelia-Fitzgerald-Shutterstock-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Your home and neighborhood could increase in value. Image: Shelia Fitzgerald/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>#3: Increased resale value</h2>
<p>Since the neighborhood is up-and-coming, you can get in before prices start to skyrocket. And as a result of your renovations, you can significantly increase the home’s resale value. “However, just make sure you understand real estate trends in that neighborhood. [Understand] what’s happening in the market and in that specific county,” Lynch advises. He warns against relying solely on word-of-mouth, which can be misleading. “It’s important to do the research, study the people and companies migrating to those areas and let the information dictate what neighborhood is best for you.”</p>
<p>When a neighborhood starts to transition, <a href="https://www.remax.com/realestateagentoffice/seattle-wa-98115-matthewvanwinkle-id29333185.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt van Winkle</a>, Founder and CEO of RE/MAX Northwest, says it often takes five to 10 years for it to really transform. But he agrees that buyers who get in early can see tremendous gains. “Value add or sweat equity homes in up-and-coming areas provide a lower entry point for buyers and the ability to be part of the transformation if they remodel a home,” he explains. You’re not only benefiting from the return on the remodel. van Winkle says you can also benefit from the appreciation of the neighborhood.</p>
<div id="attachment_321423" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321423 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/maLja-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="You might find a quirky, lively area." width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/maLja-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/maLja-Shutterstock-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/maLja-Shutterstock-768x513.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/maLja-Shutterstock-591x395.jpg 591w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/maLja-Shutterstock-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">You might find a quirky, lively area. Image: maLja/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>#4: An existing sense of community</h2>
<p>Lynch’s advice is actually based on his personal experience. “I recently bought a home in an up-and-coming neighborhood, and it was the best decision I could have made,” he says. As he was searching for the right area, Lynch looked for certain things. He wanted to find a neighborhood with an existing sense of community where he and his family could fit in and thrive. “For my family, our new neighborhood was such a great fit because we enjoyed the vibe of the neighbors, the potential job opportunities based on the companies moving into that area, and the ability to make the house and community we were moving into truly our home.”</p>
<div id="attachment_321419" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321419 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/karamysh-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Renting shouldn't be a problem after you fix up the home. " width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/karamysh-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/karamysh-Shutterstock-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/karamysh-Shutterstock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/karamysh-Shutterstock-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/karamysh-Shutterstock-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Renting shouldn&#8217;t be a problem after you fix up the home. Image: karamysh/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>#5: Appeal to a larger pool of tenants and buyers</h2>
<p>If you’re purchasing a property to flip and then rent or sell, there are several advantages to choosing one in up-and-coming areas. “For one, you have lower initial costs, but you also improve your chances of renting to good tenants or making a quick and profitable sale,” Somoza says.</p>
<p>“Everyone is looking to lower their costs of living, and many are being priced out of the popular areas in today’s rental market.  So they’re turning to — you guessed it — up-and-coming neighborhoods,” he explains And this means that you’re not likely to have any problems keeping your property rented. “You’ll also be able to increase rent as the neighborhood becomes more desirable. And you could potentially see buyers competing for an already upgraded property if you’re looking to sell,” Somoza says.</p>

<h2>#6: Create higher-quality affordable housing</h2>
<p>Investing in up-and-coming areas often leads to gentrification, but it doesn’t have to. “Actually, real estate investment in these areas can even combat gentrification by creating better affordable housing without displacing people and families,” Somoza explains. “If a developer purchases an outdated apartment complex with the intention of fixing it up and renting it out, there is an opportunity there to provide clean, updated, affordable housing to the people who already live in the area.”</p>

<h2>Finding the right up-and-coming areas</h2>
<p>There’s no exact science to identifying a neighborhood poised for growth. That said, there are a few things to look for. &#8220;Increasingly, people are rejecting far-flung suburbs and are embracing walkable, urban neighborhoods,” says <a href="https://www.citihabitats.com/brooklyn-real-estate-agents/gianpaolo-manzolillo/17003/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gianpaolo Manzolillo</a>, Licensed Real Estate Salesperson at Citi Habitats in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>“Look for areas that offer an easy commute to the downtown business district or that are located along transit lines,” he says. This is based on the theory that no one wants to spend hours sitting in traffic. “Districts that are adjacent to already-established desirable areas also offer a lot of potential for upside due to the ‘spill-over’ effect,” Manzolillo adds. When they can&#8217;t afford what they consider the prime neighborhood, people look to purchase in surrounding areas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s face it: buying a home is like a game of chess, and each person is trying to outwit the other. You want to purchase the house for the least amount of money and the seller is trying to get as much as possible out of the deal. So when should you use a lowball offer as a part of your strategy?</p>
<p>Freshome asked several top realtors to weigh in on this topic.</p>
<div id="attachment_318053" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-318053 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jimfeng-Getty.jpg" alt="holidays" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jimfeng-Getty.jpg 901w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jimfeng-Getty-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jimfeng-Getty-768x511.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jimfeng-Getty-593x395.jpg 593w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jimfeng-Getty-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>

</div>
<h2>The holidays</h2>
<p>Apparently, sellers are in a more generous mood during the most wonderful time of the year, according to <a href="http://sheltonwilder.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelton Wilder</a>, a Beverly Hills, CA-based realtor at the Douglas Elliman Real Estate Company. In fact, she remembers one buyer who put in a lowball offer on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>“The holidays and the fourth quarter are slower, but sellers tend to panic every year at this time,” Wilder says. “If a house has been sitting a while without offers, then it can create the perfect scenario for a buyer to pick up a property for a steal.” Also, she says that some sellers want to close the deal before the end of the year for tax purposes.</p>
<div id="attachment_318013" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-318013 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Haywire-media-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="house won't sell" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Haywire-media-Shutterstock.jpg 783w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Haywire-media-Shutterstock-294x300.jpg 294w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Haywire-media-Shutterstock-768x785.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Haywire-media-Shutterstock-387x395.jpg 387w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">The longer a house sits, the better your lowball offer looks. Image: Haywire Media/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>The home has been on the market for a while</h2>
<p>If a home has been sitting too long, this can also be a good time to lowball an offer. A home will generally sell for asking price <em>or over</em> in the first seven days, according to <a href="http://www.tomandjoanneteam.com/about-tom-matthews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Matthews</a>, part of the Tom and Joanne Team at Gibson Sotheby’s International Realty. &#8220;After 8 to 45 days on the market, a home is likely to sell for asking price.” But after this time frame, Matthews says a home will usually drop in price and this is an appropriate time for a lowball offer.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.jennyohomes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jenny Okhovat</a>, a realtor with Compass in Los Angeles, CA, agrees. She says that a lowball offer is only a good idea when the home has been sitting on the market for quite some time, or if your realtor recommends it. “Your realtor should work with the opposing realtor — unless <a href="https://freshome.com/for-sale-by-owner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the home is FSBO</a> — to come to a conclusion about whether or not the lowball offer will be considered by the seller,” she explains. “A lowball offer is only a good idea when there are no other offers on the table. Otherwise, it may be used against you to create a &#8216;multiple offer&#8217; dynamic.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_318052" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-318052 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ronstik-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="repairs" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ronstik-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ronstik-Shutterstock-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ronstik-Shutterstock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ronstik-Shutterstock-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ronstik-Shutterstock-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

</div>
<h2>The home needs repairs</h2>
<p>If the home needs some work, the seller should be expected to lower the price accordingly. And the more work the home will need, the lower your offer can be. “If the property is in a state of significant disrepair and the seller doesn’t have the resources to fix the property or bring it up to market standard, the sellers are going to receive offers that are much lower than <em>just</em> the cost of fixing up the property,” explains Brett Jennings, Founder of the <a href="https://www.therealexperts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real Estate Experts</a> in the California Bay Area. “Buyers are going to factor in the price of their profit margin (if they’re an investor) or the time and hassle of renovating (if they’re a homeowner).”</p>

<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Homeowners soon tire of going through the selling process. Image: Jon Bilous/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>There are failed attempts to sell</h2>
<p>Sometimes a house is on the market for a while because a sale didn’t go through. “It can be helpful to look for properties that accepted an offer and went into contract, but then the transaction fell apart and they came back to market,” Jennings says. “These sellers are often more motivated to accept lower offers.” If there has already been one failed attempt at a sale, he says they may be more open to negotiating the second time around. In this case, a lowball offer could be a good option.</p>
<div id="attachment_322809" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-322809 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Calkins-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Crime scene homes aren't popular." width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Calkins-Shutterstock.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Calkins-Shutterstock-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Calkins-Shutterstock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Calkins-Shutterstock-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Calkins-Shutterstock-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

</div>
<h2>The home has a bad history</h2>
<p>It’s not only people who can have a bad reputation. Not many people will want to live in a home that’s gained notoriety for an unpleasant reason. “A home could be unmarketable if it was the site of a highly public murder,” says Phil Georgiades, Realtor, Mortgage Expert and Chairman of <a href="https://www.fedhomeloan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FedHome Loan Centers</a>. Also, if there was a bad fire or the owner chose not to <a href="https://freshome.com/rebuild-after-hurricane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebuild after a hurricane</a>, some buyers could be apprehensive. This could help your lowball offer get accepted.</p>
<div id="attachment_318058" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-318058 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Artazum-Shutterstock-1.jpg" alt="overestimate price" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Artazum-Shutterstock-1.jpg 1000w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Artazum-Shutterstock-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Artazum-Shutterstock-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Artazum-Shutterstock-1-592x395.jpg 592w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Artazum-Shutterstock-1-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Homeowners may overestimate the value of their home. Image: Artazum/Shutterstock</p>
</div>
<h2>The home is overpriced or it&#8217;s an extreme buyers&#8217; market</h2>
<p>If the property is desirable or priced fairly, Georgiades doesn’t think a lowball offer is usually a good idea. “However, if the property is overpriced, a lowball offer may make sense,” he says. And Georgiades adds that sometimes sellers tend to overprice their homes. &#8220;If your agent appraises the home you are looking at and it is overpriced, it may make sense to write a lowball offer for fair market value,” he explains.</p>
<p>“An extreme buyers’ market is actually pretty rare,” Georgiades says. “In the past 20 years, there has almost always been a housing shortage.” However, this may vary depending on your region of the country — or even by city or part of town. If you are trying to purchase a home in an extreme buyers&#8217; market, a lowball offer will go over better.</p>
<div id="attachment_318051" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-318051 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olikoffPhotography.jpg" alt="foreclosure" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olikoffPhotography.jpg 1523w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olikoffPhotography-300x118.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olikoffPhotography-768x303.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olikoffPhotography-600x236.jpg 600w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olikoffPhotography-152x60.jpg 152w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/olikoffPhotography-329x130.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 1523px) 100vw, 1523px" /></p>

</div>
<h2>You know the seller’s motivation</h2>
<p>If you can learn a little more about the seller, you may be able to determine the reason why the home is on the market. Then, you can decide if a lowball offer could be appropriate. “I cannot stress enough the importance of dialogue with the seller or seller’s agent to understand the seller’s needs and motivation,” advises <a href="http://www.tomandjoanneteam.com/about-joanne-taranto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joanne Taranto</a> of the Tom and Joanne Team at <a href="http://www.gibsonsothebysrealty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gibson Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty</a>.</p>
<p>“Do they need to move to a new state for a job or to care for an elderly relative? Did they inherit the property but don’t have any interest in holding onto it? If you can identify what is important to the seller, you may be able to negotiate a better deal,” she says.</p>
<p>Jennings agrees. “The prospect of accepting a lowball offer is one that happens either because the seller is under some sort of stress and has a pending event like a foreclosure,” he says. “Or they don’t have the time or resources to bring a property to market.”</p>
<div id="attachment_318054" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-318054 size-full" src="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fancy-Veer-Corbis-Getty.jpg" alt="Low ball offer" width="550" srcset="https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fancy-Veer-Corbis-Getty.jpg 901w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fancy-Veer-Corbis-Getty-300x200.jpg 300w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fancy-Veer-Corbis-Getty-768x511.jpg 768w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fancy-Veer-Corbis-Getty-593x395.jpg 593w, https://freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Fancy-Veer-Corbis-Getty-323x216.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>

</div>
<h2>The risks of a lowball offer</h2>
<p>All that said, one of our realtors is against a lowball offer under any circumstances. “Talk about starting off on the wrong foot,” laments <a href="https://viviancobb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivian Cobb</a> of Colorado Springs, CO-based Cobb Real Estate. “A lowball offer is usually contrary to the spirit of trying to get the deal done.”</p>
<p>Cobb explains that getting to the finish line of a real estate transaction is a team sport. “If the other team is starting out by being insulting, it doesn’t usually go well from there,” she warns. However, Cobb also says that this practice may vary by market. “In California, for example, lowballing is the norm. But in Colorado, it’s considered bad form.”</p>
<p>And while Okhovat believes there is a time for lowball offers, she also thinks buyers should be cautious. “You don&#8217;t want to lowball a property that you really want,” she says. “[A lowball offer] can only be for a property you&#8217;re willing to lose out on if your offer is not accepted. “</p>
