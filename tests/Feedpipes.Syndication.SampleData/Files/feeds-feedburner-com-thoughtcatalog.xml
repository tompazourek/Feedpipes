				<description><![CDATA[My best friend believes in spiritual mumbo jumbo like tarot cards and psychic readings and cleansing the house with sage.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:1.125rem;">My best friend believes in spiritual mumbo jumbo like tarot cards and psychic readings and cleansing the house with sage. Despite our vastly differently beliefs, when she asked if she could stay at my place for a week, I immediately said yes. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay if you say no. I still have a spirit attached to me. I know that makes some people uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had mentioned the spirit before in late night snapchats while she was drunk on wine. I assumed <em>she</em> didn&#8217;t even believe the bullshit she was spouting. But apparently she was serious about the ghost. She said it followed her wherever she went. She said it was friendly, but it could be scary for someone who wasn&#8217;t used to the paranormal.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to be <em>too</em> nasty about something she believed in so deeply, so I told her not to worry about it. I could fend for myself. The spirit wasn&#8217;t going to bother me.</p>
<p>She arrived at my doorstep exactly one week ago with a bright blue suitcase. When she first stepped foot into the house, there was a drop in temperature. I remember it clearly because I told her: &#8220;You came at the perfect time. We were going through a heat wave but today is the coolest it&#8217;s been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, I was wrong. I realized that when I let the dog outside to pee an hour later. It was burning hot outside. The house was the only place where the temperature had dropped &#8212; and I hadn&#8217;t touched the thermostat.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think too much of it at the time. I showed my friend to her room, instructed her to keep the bathroom door closed so the dog wouldn&#8217;t nose around in the trash, and reminded her where I stored the silverware and dishes.</p>
<p>We spent the whole night talking, catching up about our careers and relationships. In the morning, I woke up earlier than her. I went to the cabinet to fetch the dog food, but the cabinet was already opened. <em>Every</em> cabinet was opened. So were the drawers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a reason why you left everything open?&#8221; I texted her in case she was awake in her guest room. &#8220;You can help yourself to whatever you want but just try to keep things shut tight. I don&#8217;t want the dog getting into bleach or rat poison. He&#8217;ll eat anything he finds.&#8221;</p>
<p>About an hour after pressing <em>send</em>, I heard the sound of the shower running. I assumed she was awake. I assumed she was getting ready to start her day. I walked toward the bathroom with the intention of reminding her where we kept our towels, but the door was swung wide open.</p>
<p>My blood boiled, but I didn&#8217;t peek inside because our shower was made of glass and I didn&#8217;t want to catch her undressing. I just swung the door closed and said, &#8220;I really can&#8217;t have the dog walking into the bathroom. He&#8217;ll eat whatever he finds. It&#8217;s the one rule of this house. Please don&#8217;t leave the door open again or the cabinets or the drawers because he&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>The door creaked open. Not the bathroom door. The one to her guest room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you yelling?&#8221; my friend asked. She rubbed at her eyes, half asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t turn the shower on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I wasn&#8217;t planning on getting up until at least eight. I&#8217;m on vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you sleepwalk or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head, walked into the bathroom, and turned off the water. &#8220;It must be the spirit. I told you how much trouble it causes. It doesn&#8217;t mean any harm, though. I&#8217;ll talk to it. I&#8217;ll let it know the dog could get hurt if anything stays open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks?&#8221; I said, unsure whether my friend was screwing with me. Later in the day, I heard her speaking to the spirit, requesting it to behave. I think I even heard her bark.</p>
<p>The rest of the week, the cabinets and drawers and doors stayed closed. The dog stayed safe. But some other strange things happened.</p>
<p>I heard footsteps above me, like someone had been crawling on the ceiling. I smelt something smoky coming from my bedroom, like a lit cigar. I saw strange dots of light everywhere &#8212; on the walls, across the television, in my mirrors. And my dreams&#8230; they were the strangest I&#8217;d ever had. They were never violent, but they were weird, like I had been tripping on acid.</p>
<p>When my friend finally left, I watched her descend down the steps and into her Uber. It took me a second to notice her suitcase wasn&#8217;t bright blue anymore. It was a deep, dark red. Like the color of old blood.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t even ask her about it. I was just glad she was gone &#8212; along with whatever came with her. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[Stop putting yourself in situations where you’re the one who cares more, the one who does more, the one who hurts more.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="p1"><b>Aries</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Don’t assume you know what someone else is thinking. Don’t assume you have their motives figured out. Don’t assume everyone hates you and is judging you when your only evidence is your self-doubt.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Taurus</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Don&#8217;t confuse vulnerability with weakness. Don&#8217;t apologize for getting teary-eyed when something upsets you. Don&#8217;t hide away your emotions out of fear someone will accuse you of being annoying and overdramatic. Don&#8217;t stop acting authentic.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Gemini</b></h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t give up on your dreams. Don&#8217;t decide chasing after your passions is a waste of your time. Don&#8217;t let negativity &#8212; from the outside and from your own mind &#8212; get to you.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Cancer</b></h3>
<p>Stop waiting until the new year to make a change. Stop putting off your own progress. Stop repeating your routine day after day after day when you&#8217;re unhappy with the way things currently are. Stop settling and start taking action.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Leo</b></h3>
<p>Stop racing to reach milestones. Stop telling yourself you&#8217;re falling behind. Stop thinking there&#8217;s a certain age you need to get married and make six digit paychecks. Stop trying to reach the goals society has set for you instead of coming up with your own, unique goals that will actually make you happy.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Virgo</b></h3>
<p>Stop worrying about what other people think of you. Stop worrying about whether you&#8217;re coming across as a good person or a bad one. Put yourself first for a change. If you need to cut someone out of your life, do it. If you need a break from socializing, take one. Do whatever is best for your own mental health.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Libra</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Don’t hover inside your comfort zone. Don’t come up with excuses to make changes tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. Don’t allow your fear to hold you in the same place because you deserve to move forward and grow outward.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Scorpio</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Stop putting so much pressure on yourself. Stop working yourself to the bone. Stop assuming you’re worthless unless you’re productive. Stop doing so much you’re bound to burn out.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Sagittarius    </b></h3>
<p class="p1">Don’t swear off of relationships completely. Don’t push the right people away. Don’t keep your guard up so high for so long that you forget how to tear it down. Don’t allow your fear of getting hurt cause you to run away from a good thing.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Capricorn </b></h3>
<p class="p1">Stop speaking so negatively about yourself. Stop calling yourself unattractive and unsuccessful. Stop assuming you’re going to fail before you even make an attempt. Stop running the worst case scenario through your head without even considering what could go right.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Aquarius</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Stop lowering your standards for people who won’t rise to meet your current ones. Stop putting yourself in situations where you’re the one who cares more, the one who does more, the one who hurts more.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><b>Pisces</b></h3>
<p class="p1">Stop assuming everything is about you. Stop assuming the reason your friend isn’t texting back quick enough is because they hate you. Stop assuming the reason your crush hasn’t liked your Instagram photo is because they want nothing to do with you. Stop jumping to conclusions.<b> </b><span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[<i>The Good Place! </i>I was so hooked and binged the first season in like two days when I started watching it.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evloy2o/" target="_blank"><strong>1. </strong></a><em>True Detective</em>, in my opinion. I don&#8217;t watch many series (because if the pilot is not good I usually don&#8217;t bother watching the rest) but this one got me going from the start.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evm7byj/" target="_blank"><strong>2. </strong></a><em>Pushing Daisies.</em> I really miss that show. I was laying in bed in the middle of the night last week thinking about it how good it was. Quirky and just wonderful.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl9ori/" target="_blank"><strong>3. </strong></a><em>Fargo</em>. The ending of the pilot was shocking and really set the tone for the rest of the amazing first series.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evkxjcq/" target="_blank"><strong>4. </strong></a>The 2000s reboot of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> — HELL of a Pilot, HELLLLLLL of a show.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl4ojh/" target="_blank"><strong>5. </strong></a><em>Dead Like Me</em> was fantastic. Poignant, funny, dark, and charming!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlyssh/" target="_blank"><strong>6. </strong></a><em>Scrubs</em>. In the pilot it not only showcased the personality of all relevant characters, it also gave a great taste of the humor to expect while still filling it with a believable and interesting story.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I love <em>Scrubs</em> and I think it&#8217;s one of the most entertaining shows ever.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl9ppt/" target="_blank"><strong>7. </strong></a>It’s no longer on the air, but the show <em>Castle</em> (Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic) had a really solid pilot episode.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlopxw/" target="_blank"><strong>8. </strong></a><em>That 70s Show.</em> Forman stealing 4 warm beers from Red and Kitty&#8217;s party.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl5c69/" target="_blank"><strong>9. </strong></a>BBC&#8217;s <em>Sherlock</em> had a great first episode. The graphics on screen are commonplace now, but that was pretty cool to me at the time.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlevwt/" target="_blank"><strong>10. </strong></a><em>Community</em>, because it introduces all the main characters, their backgrounds, and the direction of the show all in about twenty minutes.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlgd7q/" target="_blank"><strong>11. </strong></a><em>Orphan Black.</em> This show is not nearly as well known as it should be. Tatiana Maslany is an amazing actress.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl9gdt/" target="_blank"><strong>12. </strong></a><em>Ozark</em>. That show goes 0-60 reeeeeal quick.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl2uql/" target="_blank"><strong>13. </strong></a><em>Mad Men.</em> Really makes you think a certain way about Don Draper and those around him, then has a massive twist at the end which leaves you wanting more.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlauz1/" target="_blank"><strong>14. </strong></a><em>Westworld</em>. The heavy ideas kept coming fast one after the next and I thought &#8216;whoa, slow down and pace yourselves, guys!&#8217; but I was eating it all up throughout episode 1.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl6ecr/" target="_blank"><strong>15. </strong></a><em>Veronica Mars.</em> Introduced all of the plot and story for a season long arc without skipping a beat, while also making you want to know more about the characters.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlh5vp/" target="_blank"><strong>16. </strong></a><em>The Sopranos.</em> We immediately get a psychological snapshot of Tony, and the constant tension that characterizes the universe of the series is established along with the dynamics between characters that pushes the story. In my opinion, this series ushered in the golden age of television.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlc4rk/" target="_blank"><strong>17. </strong></a><em>X-Files</em>&#8230; it set the mood perfectly for that show (as long as you ignore the awful sound quality compared to later episodes in the first season).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl2xj9/" target="_blank"><strong>18. </strong></a><em>Bob&#8217;s Burgers.</em> They came right out of the gate with the fully developed characters and humor that are still going strong.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlww95/" target="_blank"><strong>19. </strong></a>First episode of <em>Hannibal</em> is really good. It really dove straight into how Will thinks and how him and Hannibal interact with each other and the people around them.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlphaa/" target="_blank"><strong>20. </strong></a><em>The Chapelle Shows</em> first episode had Clayton Bigsby the Black and Blind Klansman.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl3bts/" target="_blank"><strong>21. </strong></a><em>Mr. Robot.</em> Coming from an IT field, having a TV show get hacking so right from the first episode was a breath of fresh air. After years of the cheesy graphical interface with skull and crossbones and shit to represent hacking on movies and TV, seeing a show consistently use realistic command line interfaces, IP addresses, software, peripheral devices, social engineering, etc&#8230; is amazing.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlmpuz/" target="_blank"><strong>22. </strong></a><em>Breaking Bad.</em> I forgot just how much craziness happens in the pilot alone, until I rewatched it. I always remembered it as being spread out across a couple episodes but no, it&#8217;s all packed into the first hour.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl1yc0/" target="_blank"><strong>23. </strong></a><em>The Good Place!</em> I was so hooked and binged the first season in like two days when I started watching it.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I just love the show in general though. I feel like almost all of their jokes land and the humor is just so perfectly crafted and meshes well with the characters and situations they&#8217;ve created. First season is definitely the best but 2 and 3 are still so enjoyable!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evltfh4/" target="_blank"><strong>24. </strong></a><em>Brooklyn 99.</em> I usually take several episodes to get invested in a comedy series, but B99 had me hooked from the beginning.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlv6ux/" target="_blank"><strong>25. </strong></a><em>Archer</em>. &#8220;The thought of me dying gave you an ERECTION?!&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlwmlt/" target="_blank"><strong>26. </strong></a><em>Friday Night Lights</em> really is the best pilot ever. I thought I knew exactly what show I was watching, then street&#8217;s injury happened and I was just speechless for the rest of the episode. When it finished I honestly had no idea what the hell I had just seen.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evm34lk/" target="_blank">27.</a> </strong><em>Heroes</em>. I love the pilot so much. The whole first season is great but the “save the cheerleader, save the world” arc is my favorite part to watch over and over. Too bad the rest of the series goes downhill from there.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evliaev/" target="_blank"><strong>28. </strong></a><em>Penny Dreadful</em> sucks you in and keeps you hooked right from the pilot. I need to rewatch the series at some point.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evkxkft/" target="_blank"><strong>29. </strong></a><em>Suits</em>. 2 hour episode, best one of the 9 seasons. Could watch it over and over.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlr53k/" target="_blank"><strong>30. </strong></a><em>Cheers</em> was really well done, all of the characters had really great intros, and great interactions with each other.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evm92ka/" target="_blank"><strong>31. </strong></a><em>The Wire.</em> The first scene is absolutely brilliant, and sets the stage for a show unlike any other before or since.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl2qlt/" target="_blank"><strong>32. </strong></a><em>LOST</em>. I don’t know why but I’ll never forget the way Locke smiled at Kate while eating that orange.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl2dtq/" target="_blank"><strong>33. </strong></a><em>Game Of Thrones</em>, really puts into perspective of what kind of show it is right away.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evljs7v/" target="_blank"><strong>34. </strong></a><em>The Americans.</em> I re-watched recently and was surprised at how many of my favorite scenes from the first season were actually in the pilot episode.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evliaev/" target="_blank"><strong>35. </strong></a><em>Shameless</em> does a good job of pulling you in with the pilot</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl1unj/" target="_blank"><strong>36. </strong></a><em>Futurama</em>. That show had me hooked from the start and 20 years later it&#8217;s still an amazing pilot episode and series as whole. It&#8217;s also pretty amazing they setup something in the pilot that would be a major plot point many seasons later with Nibbler&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evln8a3/" target="_blank"><strong>37. </strong></a><em>Eureka</em>! The pilot had such a sense of mystery and wonder, I loved it! Unfortunately, by the time it&#8217;s over you know exactly what&#8217;s going on and the rest of the show, while fun, is not nearly as interesting as the pilot.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evm5ygj/" target="_blank"><strong>38. </strong></a><em>Person Of Interest.</em> I love this series! There&#8217;s some amazing one liners that are so deadpan and I still crack up at all of Fusco&#8217;s names for Root. Plus Jim Caviezel is pretty easy on the eyes too!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlgbfa/" target="_blank"><strong>39. </strong></a>I thought that the pilot episode of <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> was fantastic. Subsequent episodes lagged behind a bit, and I stopped watching around season 3 I think, but the pilot episode was absolutely solid.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evkxmhe/" target="_blank"><strong>40. </strong></a><em>The Walking Dead.</em> I lost interest later in the series (like season 4 or something), but that first episode is awesome.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlq3wz/" target="_blank"><strong>41. </strong></a><em>Last Man On Earth.</em> Almost zero dialogue all the way through, just a man with nothing to do but kill time and be ridiculously silly.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl399r/" target="_blank"><strong>42. </strong></a><em>Arrested Development</em> had a perfect pilot in my opinion. Funny from the start and introduced all the characters.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl7knl/" target="_blank"><strong>43. </strong></a><em>Letterkenny</em>. The cold open is so fucking fire, and the show only gets better from there.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl6us0/" target="_blank"><strong>44. </strong></a><em>The Shield</em> sets up every single character motivation, personality, and conflict for the whole series in the very first episode. You know who, what, and why for the entire series.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The last seconds of the first episode weighs on the main characters and haunts them until the last seconds of the final episode of the series.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The best cop drama of all time, hands down.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlq18f/" target="_blank"><strong>45. </strong></a><em>White Collar. </em>So underrated, I really enjoyed most of its seasons. I think I&#8217;m due for a rewatch</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evly182/" target="_blank"><strong>46. </strong></a><em>Burn Notice. </em>There are a few actors who I feel were born for their role and one of them is Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlq073/" target="_blank"><strong>47. </strong></a><em>Justified</em>. Perfect introduction to Raylan Givens.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlfrr1/" target="_blank"><strong>48. </strong></a><em>Prison Break. </em>It&#8217;s fucking mental. The tattoos, the ridiculous dialogue, the matchstick Taj Mahal. Ridiculous show overall, but a lot of fun.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlsy48/" target="_blank"><strong>49. </strong></a><em>Fringe</em>. I wasn&#8217;t really sure about this show at first. But the first exchange between Olivia and Walter about the pudding had my laughing out loud. John Noble carried that show for me.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlpn87/" target="_blank"><strong>50. </strong></a><em>Twin Peaks.</em> Damn fine pilot episode.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evm7c7u/" target="_blank"><strong>51. </strong></a><em>Gravity Falls.</em> That was such a great show. I respect that they ended where they ended but I still want more of that universe (maybe a spinoff or sequel show).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlnd8v/" target="_blank"><strong>52. </strong></a><em>Preacher</em>. That show has been a fun ride. I don&#8217;t know anyone personally that watches it sadly.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl5t54/" target="_blank"><strong>53. </strong></a><em>Designated Survivor</em>, I am in fact willing to defend that it is the best 46 minutes of television ever. It not only sets up each and every character and their personalities, but it also puts you into that uncomfortable and unnerving feeling. As if what happening on screen is what’s happening in real life. The first five minutes of the show, while they may be shocking, they play up the tone of the show to perfection.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl97n0/" target="_blank"><strong>54. </strong></a><em>This Is Us.</em> The utilization of the two time lines used as a twist was impressive.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evm0ltr/" target="_blank"><strong>55. </strong></a><em>The Expanse.</em> I was hooked from the first five minutes when I saw Julie Mao floating in zero gravity, trapped in a room and screaming for help.</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">My first thoughts were, &#8220;Being trapped alone in space has to be one of the worst forms of torture.&#8221;</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">The show has only gotten better and I feel that each season was better than the last.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl3ces/" target="_blank"><strong>56. </strong></a>I still remember watching the <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> pilot. Little did I know the journey that it would take me on from the highs to the lows. I really felt like I grew with the characters. While the last season(s) were so-so, I still look back fondly on it. It&#8217;s such a small thing, but their usual bar hangout always reminds me of my favorite hangout, Shenanigans, in Louisville.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evmkwn4/" target="_blank"><strong>57. </strong></a><em>Supernatural</em>. The best quotes came from the first episode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evllpoc/" target="_blank"><strong>58. </strong></a><em>Lucifer</em>, I love it when he’s in his car with the devil themed music and the great view of LA.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl27ym/" target="_blank"><strong>59. </strong></a><em>Rick and Morty&#8217;s</em> first episode encompassed everything great about the show.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlu3xx/" target="_blank"><strong>60. </strong></a><em>Chuck</em>. Everything in the pilot episode was perfect; the story, the setup, the characters, the soundtrack, the plot device&#8230; Just everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlinpz/" target="_blank"><strong>61. </strong></a><em>The Man in the High Castle</em> had a really good pilot episode. Made me addicted to the show and I finished the first season within two days.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlphqn/" target="_blank">62.</a> </strong><em>Crazy Ex Girlfriend</em> had a perfect pilot. &#8220;West Covina&#8221; was great, and &#8220;Sexy Getting Ready Song&#8221; was fantastic. Also, Paula being the rom-com trope of &#8220;bitter female coworker&#8221; for the majority of the episode only to subvert that trope with the ending reprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlf8r5/" target="_blank"><strong>63. </strong></a><em>The West Wing!</em> The introduction to President Bartlet might be my favorite moment in TV history.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlq768/" target="_blank"><strong>64. </strong></a><em>Misfits</em>. Characters guaranteed to get your attention, especially Nathan. You&#8217;ll be laughing all the time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlyaf7/" target="_blank"><strong>65. </strong></a><em>Chernobyl</em>, you can immediately see that they really thought about what to put in the first episode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlzkfn/" target="_blank"><strong>66. </strong></a><em>Outlander</em>. The way the time travel transition from 1945 to 1745 was just amazing. I also loved how Claire took care of Jamie&#8217;s arm that was so cute!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlewk9/" target="_blank"><strong>67. </strong></a>The original <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">MacGyver</em> series. Look, it&#8217;s rare to consider the pilot episode of any series the best episode, but I think that may be the case for MacGyver.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlumtf/" target="_blank"><strong>68. </strong></a><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> pilot drew me into the show immediately.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evlwx0g/" target="_blank"><strong>69. </strong></a>Loved the <em>My Name is Earl</em> pilot. That show doesn&#8217;t get enough credit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cka3oe/what_tv_show_has_the_best_pilot_episode/evl5wn5/" target="_blank"><strong>70.</strong></a> <em>Black Mirror.</em> They really did rip that band aid off about what this show was gonna be like with that first episode, eh?</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I&#8217;ve never watched an episode of TV that made me squirm in my chair more than that one. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p>

		<title>Losing Yourself To A Toxic Relationship</title>

				<description><![CDATA[You assume nothing good lasts forever. You assume there must be a catch whenever you come across someone who is on their best behavior. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&#8217;ve lost yourself to a toxic relationship, it&#8217;s hard to get back into the dating game. It&#8217;s hard to believe there are people out there who are going to treat you right.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re always on guard, always ready for someone who <em>seemed </em>like a good person to turn around and show you their true colors. Even though you <em>want</em> to believe in fairy tale romances, your toxic relationship has morphed you into a skeptic &#8212; or what you like to call, a realist.</p>
<p>When someone drowns you with affection, when they make you feel beautiful and valued and <em>seen</em>, you wonder whether it&#8217;s an act &#8212; and how long they&#8217;re going to be able to keep up that act. You assume nothing good lasts forever. You assume there must be a catch whenever you come across someone who is on their best behavior.</p>
<p>Even when someone reminds you your last relationship was an abnormality, that love isn&#8217;t supposed to hurt, a part of you wonders whether they&#8217;re only saying what they think they&#8217;re <em>supposed</em> to say. You wonder whether all of the happy relationships you&#8217;ve seen are secretly a sham, whether they&#8217;re fighting just as much behind closed doors as you used to fight with your person. You wonder whether every relationship goes downhill eventually &#8212; or whether you&#8217;re broken for even <em>wondering</em> something so dark.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve lost yourself to a toxic relationship, it&#8217;s hard to remember what healthy communication looks like. Since you&#8217;re more used to violent confrontations than mature compromises, you&#8217;re worried you&#8217;re going to ruin each new relationship you enter by acting in extremes. Either you&#8217;ll blow up at them because that&#8217;s the way you&#8217;re used to acting or you&#8217;ll keep secrets hidden from them out of fear of overreacting.</p>
<p>Even though your ex was the toxic one, some of their negativity rubbed off on you. They warped your way of thinking about love. They changed the way you behave in a relationship. You aren&#8217;t sure how to be a good partner anymore. You aren&#8217;t sure what&#8217;s normal anymore. You have to relearn everything you thought you knew. You have to rewire your brain in certain ways, because if you treat someone new the way you treated your toxic ex, the cycle might repeat.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve lost yourself to a toxic relationship, the embarrassment doesn&#8217;t go away for a while. You feel weird reaching out to friends who you lost touch with throughout the relationship. You feel weird answering questions about why you stayed so long and what made you finally decide to leave. You feel weird about embarking on life alone after spending so much time in a relationship, even though it was a bad one.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve lost yourself to a toxic relationship, it&#8217;s hard to see the light again. It&#8217;s hard to believe there are good people in this world who would never dream of putting you through the hell your ex put you through &#8212; but you have to keep reminding yourself your toxic relationship wasn&#8217;t healthy. It wasn&#8217;t the way love is supposed to feel. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p>

		<title>Why Your Last Breakup Hasn’t Broken You </title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because you aren&#8217;t under the impression being single is the end of the world. Being single gives you a chance to explore your inner workings. It gives you a chance to relearn what you want out of this universe. It gives you a chance to relax, reset, and rethink your future.</p>
<p>Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because you know a thing or two about <em>standards. </em>You never want to settle for a relationship where you aren&#8217;t getting exactly what you want. You never want to fight for someone who isn&#8217;t interested in fighting for you. You never want to force yourself into a situation that isn&#8217;t working for either party.</p>
<p class="p1">Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because you realize love isn&#8217;t the most important thing in the world &#8212; at least, romantic love is not. You still have the love from your family and friends and pets and coworkers and neighbors. You have love for your career and your hobbies and your passions. Most importantly, you have love for <em>yourself</em>.</p>
<p>Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because as much as it hurt to lose someone you considered important in your life, you also realize they aren&#8217;t your <em>entire</em> life. Your heart still beats without him. Your lungs still breathe without him. Your confidence still soars without him. Losing him might have meant rearranging your schedule and altering your relationship status, but it hasn&#8217;t changed much else. You&#8217;re still you &#8212; and you&#8217;re still beautiful.</p>
<p>Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because you&#8217;re strong at your core. You might have spent nights crying over him. You might have gotten drunk and texted him the most embarrassing <em>I miss you</em> messages in the world. But, after enough time, you were able to overcome your desire to get back together with him. You were able to take a step back and realize he isn&#8217;t the one for you.</p>
<p>Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because you understand your ex wasn&#8217;t the only person in the world who would ever agree to date you. You know you&#8217;re going to love again. You know your ex wasn&#8217;t your only chance at romance. Once you&#8217;re finished healing, you&#8217;re going to put yourself out there again. You&#8217;re going to take risks on love again.</p>
<p>Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because you don&#8217;t want to be in a relationship just so you can say you&#8217;re in a relationship. If you&#8217;re going to date someone, you want it to be the right someone. You want it to be someone who empowers you, who supports you, who respects your heart and body and soul. You aren&#8217;t willing to settle for anything less than that.</p>
<p>Your last breakup hasn&#8217;t broken you because you <em>cannot</em> be broken. You might fall apart sometimes, but you&#8217;re always going to pull yourself together again. You&#8217;re a survivor. You&#8217;re a badass. You&#8217;re a beautiful, intelligent, worthwhile soul. You have what it takes to get through your latest breakup &#8212; and you can handle anything else this world throws at you too. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your soft heart is a beautiful thing &#8212; but not everyone is going to realize that. Some people are going to be thrown off by your authenticity. They aren&#8217;t going to know what to expect from you since you behave completely different than everyone else in the modern dating world.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people are going to act like <em>you&#8217;re</em> the one in the wrong because they don&#8217;t want to deal with their own baggage. They don&#8217;t want to stop and ask themselves why they&#8217;re so guarded, why they&#8217;re so standoffish, why they&#8217;re so afraid of commitment. Instead, they&#8217;re going to label you as clingy or crazy or overemotional. They&#8217;re going to act like there&#8217;s something wrong with you for being so deeply in touch with your emotions when really they should be <em>learning</em> from you. They should be picking up pointers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people are going to accuse you of suffocating them. They&#8217;re going to say that you move too fast, that you love too hard, that you are just <em>too much. </em>You can&#8217;t let their opinion get to you. You have to accept it and move on. You have to restart your quest for love because the person you belong with isn&#8217;t someone who would fault you for having a soft heart. It&#8217;s someone who will love you for it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people aren&#8217;t going to understand why you feel so deeply. They aren&#8217;t going to understand how you could spend so much time grieving a relationship that never even turned official. They aren&#8217;t going to understand how such seemingly small things could have such a large impact on you. They aren&#8217;t going to understand the way your soft heart beats.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the people you love the most aren&#8217;t going to appreciate everything you&#8217;ve done for them. They aren&#8217;t going to realize how much you&#8217;ve sacrificed in the name of love. They aren&#8217;t going to thank you for how much support you&#8217;ve always given them, how much effort, how much time. And that is <em>not</em> the way it should be. You should find someone who returns your favors, who matches your passion.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people are going to take advantage of your soft heart. They&#8217;re going to see how much attention you give them, see how transparent you are with them about your feelings, and they&#8217;re going to use your openness against you. They&#8217;re going to use your <em>feelings</em> against you. They&#8217;re going to manipulate you into sticking around with them for longer than they deserve. They&#8217;re going to say all of the <em>right </em>things at all of the <em>right </em>times because it&#8217;s easy to get forgiveness from you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, soft hearts aren&#8217;t appreciated. Sometimes, you&#8217;re going to feel like you&#8217;re alone in the world of modern dating, you&#8217;re going to feel like there isn&#8217;t anyone else out there as authentic as you, as committed as you, as annoyed with games as you. But you&#8217;re going to find someone who appreciates your soft heart one day. You&#8217;re going to find someone who would never use your emotions against you. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p>

		<title>Doing Nothing Will Be Your Biggest Regret</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The worst regrets are the ones you have about holding yourself back, about hesitating to put yourself out there, about playing it safe and remaining inside your comfort zone.</p>
<p>The worst regrets make you feel like a coward, like a fraud, like a failure. They make you wish you would have had the confidence to chase after what you wanted. They make you wish you would have picked a different path because there&#8217;s no telling what could have happened if you believed in yourself a little more.</p>
<p>Even though risks are scary, you cannot always choose the easiest path. After all, the easiest path is rarely going to lead to the most fulfilling results.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: If you take a risk on yourself, then there is a chance it won&#8217;t work out, there is a chance you&#8217;ll feel awkward, there is a chance you&#8217;ll end up regretting your decision. But if you do <em>nothing</em>, then the regret is guaranteed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always better to regret something you <em>did</em> because at least you can say you tried.</p>
<p>Besides, if you take a risk and end up regretting it, at least you&#8217;ll learn a lesson along the way. If you ask someone out and they reject you, at least you&#8217;ll know they aren&#8217;t interested in dating you. If you end up in a bad relationship, at least you&#8217;ll learn this person isn&#8217;t the right one for you &#8212; and you&#8217;ll learn to raise your standards in the future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you end up regretting something you <em>didn&#8217;t </em>do like not asking out someone on a date or not applying for your dream position, then there&#8217;s no lesson learned. You have no idea whether you would have succeeded or failed. You have no idea whether you made a mistake or made the correct decision. The <em>what ifs</em> will eat away at you. They will slowly make you angry with yourself. They might even make you hate yourself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to regret trying than to regret sitting around and wishing you tried. It&#8217;s better to put yourself out there and risk making a fool of yourself than it is to hide yourself away and wish things worked out differently. It&#8217;s better to take a chance on yourself than to doubt yourself.</p>
<p>If you take a risk, even the <em>worst case scenario</em> isn&#8217;t that bad. No, you might not get the results you were hoping to get, but there are silver linings. You might regret asking someone out who turned you down, but you can also be <em>proud</em> of how brave you were and how confident you acted in the moment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re regretting something you <em>didn&#8217;t </em>do then you&#8217;re probably mad at yourself for your lack of confidence and bravery. You&#8217;re probably annoyed that you didn&#8217;t have the guts to do what you really wanted to do.</p>
<p>No matter what path you choose, you&#8217;re always going to have some sort of regret. So make your regrets good ones. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know that there is a part of you that is thinking about giving you past relationship another chance.</p>
<p>It makes sense to want to justify trying again in relationships. We know that everyone makes mistakes, including ourselves. Some things can be easily forgiven. Some require a little more communication and sincerity but can be worked through. And some are just too large and too consistent to ignore, forcing you to reevaluate everything you thought you knew.</p>
<p>You sit with your head in your hands, because you know how much you care about this person. Letting them go wasn’t something done lightly. You made a decision based on what you had to do for you, and that meant you couldn’t stick around and let them continue to hurt you the way they had. You couldn’t just pretend everything was fine when everything really wasn’t.</p>
<p>You found a way to pick yourself back up and keep pressing forward because you know you deserve more than that.</p>
<p>Yet then, you ran into them by accident. Or you caught a glimpse of something they posted online. Or, they reached out to you, and you ended up having a conversation with them- one where they asked for another chance because they realized just how wrong they were. They swear they’ve learned from their mistakes and they want to prove it to you if you can just let them do so.</p>
<p>And for a moment, you think about letting them try again.</p>
<p>You remember all the wonderful times, the good memories. The things that made you feel like nothing bad could ever happen to the two of you. You justify that everyone makes mistakes and that maybe you shouldn’t hold it against them so harshly. That giving them another chance could be the start of something great for both of you again.</p>
<p>Yet in your gut, you know that it’s not really about that, is it? It’s not about whether people can change, or whether you are obligated to give them another try at showing how much they love you. It’s not really about them at all. It’s about you.</p>
<p>Because sometimes relationships are the catalysts to teach you lessons, whether or not that’s what you expected. Sometimes they are meant to be only moments, not permanence. They’re meant to show you aspects of yourself that you didn’t know existed, both the good and the bad. They’re meant to show you who you are and what you want out of life. While relationships involve two people, and they are both important, you also need to know that it’s okay to do what is best for you.</p>
<p>Because right now, this is about you, and how without this person in your life right now, you’re still surviving. Even more so, you’re moving forward. You’re looking around and realizing that the world didn’t fall apart, even when someone you deeply trusted and loved hurt you. Even when they couldn’t be trusted anymore.</p>
<p>It’s wonderful that they realized their mistake. That they saw what they had done and now are trying to be a better person because of it. Yet that doesn’t mean you have to be the person they test this out on. You know there will always be that small lack of trust that exists because even if they never do that thing again, you will always remember it in the back of your mind. You will wonder if in a week, or a few months, or a few years they will do something like that again. Even though people might feel they deserve a second chance, you aren’t required to let them back in for any reason- history, feelings, or otherwise. When you let them go, you were saying, “This is something I can’t put up with, and I refuse to.” You were defining your boundaries, and if that person loves you as much as they claim they do, then they should respect those boundaries now- even if it means they don’t get what they want.</p>
<p>It can seem harsh, but not every relationship is meant to come back together just because people learned from their mistakes. You need to know it’s not your responsibility to let someone back in just because it’s what they want. Not when deep down, you know the best thing for you (and them, even if they don’t see it yet) is to part ways and take the lessons you learned with you. Keep those lessons in mind when you fall in love with another person.</p>
<p>So if they’ve changed, that’s great. Let them show that to someone else. Let them take what they’ve learned and use that knowledge not to hurt the next person they give their heart to.</p>
<p>You are just fine without them.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The first time you told me that you loved me, I knew that my feelings were getting to that point, too. I just didn't want to admit it to either of us.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>One, I lied. To you and to myself.</i></p>
<p>The first time you told me that you loved me, I knew that my feelings were getting to that point, too. I just didn&#8217;t want to admit it to either of us.</p>
<p><i>Two, I was scared.</i></p>
<p>Scared of how strongly I felt for you. It was too much, too fast. You made me feel things that I never thought I would feel. It&#8217;s terrifying.</p>
<p><i>Three, I&#8217;m still scared.</i></p>
<p>Scared that I feel too much. That I&#8217;m giving you everything and leaving myself with nothing. Scared that in the end, I&#8217;m just gonna be scarred.</p>
<p><i>Four, I will always fuck up.</i></p>
<p>I tend to mess up the best things that happen to me no matter how hard I try not to. When things are perfect, my stupidity and immaturity ruin things. I do things that I know I shouldn&#8217;t. Then I end up full of regrets that I cannot take back.</p>
<p><i>Five, my imagination has a mind of its own.</i></p>
<p>Even if I know what the truth is, I still have thoughts that are so wild that it makes me think of things that I know I shouldn&#8217;t have. Which brings us back to number four. I will always fuck up.</p>
<p><i>Six, I&#8217;m impulsive.</i></p>
<p>I usually say or do things without really thinking it through or caring about the consequences, good or bad. Which, again, brings us back to number four, I will always fuck up.</p>
<p><i>Seven, what people say, sometimes affects me in the long-run.</i></p>
<p>If they tell me lies about you despite me knowing the truth, sometimes, when I&#8217;m feeling really weak and vulnerable, those lies would be all that I can think about. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t trust you. Because I do, I swear I do.</p>
<p><i>Eight, I&#8217;m clingy as fuck.</i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna want to be with you every second of every day. Think of me as flypaper, and you&#8217;re the fly. Getting rid of me will be that hard.</p>
<p><i>Nine, I&#8217;m a hopeless romantic.</i></p>
<p>Before I met you, reading was my escape. Every scene, every kiss, every chapter, I longed for me to be that girl. Reading set my expectations too high. Reachable but not probable. I&#8217;m gonna expect some things I got from books but that doesn&#8217;t mean you need to do them. It would be a plus though if you do.</p>
<p><i>Ten, I want all of your &#8220;I love yous&#8221; to be mine.</i></p>
<p>Unless they are for you mom or sister, I&#8217;ll get jealous if you say it to some other girl. Even if she&#8217;s just a friend.</p>
<p><i>Eleven, I hope you never get tired of hearing me say &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Because I will never stop. Never ever. I&#8217;ll do everything I can to show it in all ways possible.</p>
<p><i>Twelve, I&#8217;m gonna make things right.</i></p>
<p>I know that I&#8217;m not the Flash and that I can&#8217;t travel back in time to fix things, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. What does matter is the here and now. Every decision I make, every choice I choose, every path I take, will be dedicated to making a better version of me. Because that&#8217;s what you deserve. What we deserve.</p>
<p><i>Thirteen, there will be relapses.</i></p>
<p>Number four will be a constant in our lives, but I&#8217;m doing everything I can to avoid it. We make mistakes. We do stupid things. We&#8217;re only human. And we can only do so much. I swear that I&#8217;ll make it up to you, though.</p>
<p><i>Fourteen, I love you.</i></p>
<p>So much that sometimes it hurts already. It feels like a double-edged sword at times. But I&#8217;m okay with that. Because love wouldn&#8217;t be love without a little bit of pain.</p>
<p><i>Fifteen, you&#8217;re it for me.</i></p>
<p>No matter what future I look at, what timeline it&#8217;s in, you&#8217;re always there. I can&#8217;t imagine one without you. Call me crazy, obsessed, or naive, but that&#8217;s how things will always be for me.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Let today change you.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most destructive lies aren’t the ones told to us — they’re the ones we tell ourselves. Those lies we repeat quietly to convince ourselves that this relationship we cherish so much is as valuable to them as it is to us. Those lies we whisper to our tired brain to convince ourselves that the red flags aren’t there and that our mind is playing tricks on us yet again. But deep down we know. We know we can’t blame our overthinking on this one. We know the red flags are real, but we lie to ourselves to protect our tender heart from reality, the reality that they love us, but not in that way.</p>
<p>We convince ourselves that if they’ve become distant it’s simply because they’re busy. We look for explanations to explain why they don’t have time to talk on the phone anymore, why they always seem to forget to text back, and why they don’t have time to see us. They just have a lot going on, and they express their love differently than we do. We repeat these excuses over and over again until we forget what the actual truth is: they don’t love us like we love them.</p>
<p>The truth is, if someone wants to be in your life, they will be. They will be, whether their day was hectic or not. They will be, no matter who texts whom first. They’ll be here when life is beautiful and you laugh together until your guts hurt, but they’ll also be here when life is difficult. They’ll be here on those lonely nights when you can’t fall asleep, and those mornings when you can’t get up because your heart weighs too much. They will be there when it’s easy and when it’s not.</p>
<p>If someone wants to be in your life, you’ll never have to doubt it. You’ll just know. There won’t be any mixed signals. There won’t be tears about things between you being so much better yesterday than they are today. There won’t be confusion, and you won’t have to wonder how your relationship can be a fairytale one day and a drama the next.</p>
<p>Let today be the day you stop lying to yourself. Let it be the day you move on, the day you forgive yourself for loving them too deeply, and for investing time and pieces of your heart in someone who wasn’t ready for your love. Let today change you. You’ve got this.</p>
