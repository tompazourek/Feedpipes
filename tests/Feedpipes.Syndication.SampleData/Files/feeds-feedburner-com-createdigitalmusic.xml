<p>&#8220;Life can feel too fast sometimes,&#8221; say the creators. Yeah, no s***, especially with a world that is apparently actively on fire and run by people who seem to want to fan the flames rather than put it out. Wait, sorry, what was I talking about? Oh yeah. Chill. Slow down. Om.</p>



<p>Or rather, turn that Om into Ohm. </p>



<p>Dawless Jamming has an open call for meditative modular, extending on the channel&#8217;s patches and whatnot. Literally it came to the moderator in a dream, they say &#8211; &#8220;Rings into Clouds Forever.&#8221;</p>



<p>More details on the YouTube link above.</p>



<p>Breathe in, breathe out. Your patch cables are getting very heavy&#8230; </p>



<p>Let go of your fears and attachments. Do not worry about personal possessions&#8230; oh, wait, you let go of all of those already, you&#8217;re in modular&#8230;</p>



<p>Great stuff, though for me it still can&#8217;t top the soporific impact of this:</p>

<p>The population growth of producers may make musicians nervous. But here&#8217;s one potential upside &#8211; there&#8217;s now a growing market for your sounds, not just your tracks. The latest deal between Loopmasters and Beatport points in this direction.</p>



<p>Follow along here, because this partnership is a little tricky to explain. (CDM was given an exclusive first look at the deal slightly in advance.) First, US- and Germany-based Beatport already had its own section full of loops and sound packs, called Beatport Sounds &#8211; and Beatport over the years has told us it&#8217;s been a big, growing business. </p>



<p>On the Loopmasters side, that company has a robust business across a number of models &#8211; you can buy sounds a la carte as downloads, you can subscribe to Loopcloud, or, via a sister company, you can stock up on plug-in effects and instruments (and preset content) via Plugin Boutique. </p>



<p>So, what happens now is, Beatport invests in Loopmasters, they sell their Beatport Sounds business <em>to Loopmasters</em>, and then over time you&#8217;ll see the Loopmasters stuff show up as part of the Beatport site. Beatport has some 36 million annual visitors, meaning that is some significant customer acquisition and sales potential added to Loopmasters. Loopmasters remains one of soundware&#8217;s enduring players, operating since 2003 and with sound partnerships with most major gear makers &#8211; plus, crucially, a huge catalog of the kinds of sounds producers in some particularly lucrative genres want. So the pairing makes sense.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s another angle here &#8211; there&#8217;s an overlap between content that can be streamed live, not downloaded, on a subscription model, rather than an a la carte model. That&#8217;s been Beatport&#8217;s push with Beatport Link and Beatport Pro, but only when it comes to tracks. Loopmasters has pulled off the much harder feat of making this work with sounds. Their Loopcloud tool not only lets you subscribe to content, but lets you preview sounds right inside your DAW, even matched to key and tempo. </p>



<p>Beatport and Loopmasters haven&#8217;t said yet what it&#8217;ll look like, but they at least promise that we&#8217;ll see these Loopmasters tools (including the streaming and subscription stuff) integrated into Beatport&#8217;s site &#8220;over the next year.&#8221; </p>



<p>Beatport and Loopmasters may be most excited about these gee-whiz streaming and subscription features, but with or without it, I suspect it&#8217;s a big deal that Beatport will have access to Loopmasters&#8217; exhaustive catalog. That means for people looking for a particular genre or bit, it&#8217;s more likely to be there &#8211; and that Loopmasters can acquire DJs curious about dabbling in production (or even adding some live loops to a hybrid set) who may not yet be familiar with the Loopmasters brand and products.</p>



<p>This also would appear to give Loopmasters a leg up as Native Instruments works on their own Sounds.com offering. (Keeping score, at least NI now has Maschine and Komplete Kontrol integration &#8211; with the latter offering DAW integration, as does Loopcloud.) There also something coming with Plugin Boutique, but the two companies haven&#8217;t said yet what they&#8217;re thinking.</p>



<p>The other math here I think is pretty obvious. With more people making music, even as the business of releasing music as albums may or may not be working for producers, there&#8217;s the chance that your customers might be other producers. I even wonder if we&#8217;ll start to see distribution and marketing deals that combine releases of albums with associated loops or sound content.</p>



<p>Of course, whether that appeals to artists is a pretty individual decision. I do also suspect this will reignite the discussion of soundware and originality. And it&#8217;s odd, in a way, that the market is now splitting between extreme homegrown sound design (like Eurorack modular) on one hand, and loads of instant-access pre-built content on the other. But such is the state of music in 2019 &#8211; code everything from scratch, concoct it out of loops, or really anything in between. Just be aware, DJs browsing loops, you may start with looking for a tech-house groove and wind up with thousands of dollars of modular gear in your house. Don&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t try to warn you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Underground romantic engineering&#8221; is the motto of up-and-coming gearmaker SOMA Laboratory. Here&#8217;s a look at the Russian-Polish foundry creating wild new electronic instruments &#8211; and their latest creation.</p>



<p>Music store All For DJ has become a badly-needed new hub for Moscow&#8217;s electronic producers. Despite the name, they&#8217;re host to all kind of electronic instruments. I met the folks operating the retailer earlier this summer, and it&#8217;s an oasis &#8211; easy access to lots of gear, which had until recently sometimes been a challenge in Russia, and also tons of information (including a Russian-language blog). </p>



<p>And they&#8217;re producing documentaries, like this one looking at SOMA. It&#8217;ll definitely be up CDMers&#8217; alley &#8211; Ukrainian-Russian creator Vlad Kreimer is the kind of mad scientist experimental musician we love. Now, his Lyra-8 has become a sought-after, one-of-a-kind instrument, and he&#8217;s teaming up with  Vyacheslav Grigoriev (previously of VG-Line). (Vyacheslav  joined me last year on a panel for Synthposium in Moscow, talking about his upbringing in electronics in the USSR.) The operation is growing, with operations both in Russia and Poland, as the electronic music community embraces exactly this sort of strange.</p>



<p>The film is a beautiful and intimate portrait of the creators and their ideas (subtitled in English):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The Lyra synth is like a &#8220;book, album, work of art that contains a message,&#8221; says Vlad. And there&#8217;s a new tome coming &#8211; the Pulsar-23, which brings the same ethos to drum machines. Its release is eagerly anticipated, with photos (seen here) showing it in final prototype state, about to hit production. (Advance buyers are apparently bugging them for that.)</p>



<p>Vlad showed off the new box at Superbooth in Berlin in May (which I missed, ironically, as I had to fly to St. Petersburg &#8211; positions keep swapping):</p>

<p>Amsterdam collective Dance with Pride&#8217;s launched an eight hour takeover of Red Light Radio over the weekend. It&#8217;s worth a listen, covering the gamut from sex worker activists to &#8220;cheap Moroccan music&#8221;.</p>



<p>Dance with Pride got its start as a way of bridging activism around LGBTQIA+ pride with the dance music community. Apart from taking on the causes of the marginalized, it also offers something for your ears that should be refreshing &#8211; a needed break from business-as-usual sound. (Hey, music is good at that. Diversity isn&#8217;t just some political abstraction, but something that can tickle your ears.)</p>



<p>As its organizers offered in 2017, that&#8217;s a chance for an all-encompassing and necessary approach to a broad spectrum of artists:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The Dance With Pride initiative kindly reminds you that the roots of Dance Music stem from diverse Queer, Black and Latino communities &#8230; This Pride weekend is the perfect time to reflect on this and pay your respects on the dance floor.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Progressive-minded Amsterdam is known for being outspoken and forward-thinking on these issues, and it&#8217;s fitting that the radio takeover takes place in a street-front window formerly used by prostitutes. (It&#8217;s still the red light district around the radio station, in the tourist-crowded center of the city, where space is at an impossible premium. Having DJed there, you get a kind of fascinating fishbowl effect &#8211; so plenty of gawkers peer in from roughly the same vantage point as the infamous Internet streaming camera.)</p>



<p>Even in Amsterdam, though, there&#8217;s a palpable sense of urgency. Summer 2019 in Europe brings elevated concerns for the safety of queer communities. Right-wing pressure has erupted across the continent, including in <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/44171?fbclid=IwAR2IYyqeCMvEWLO6snMSSVpgzOVo6hZOLhJEglQXlNVI2KoN-ZlnqwfhQKE">alarming attacks in Poland</a> that involved some members of the electronic music community there. The Netherlands have also seen right-wing groups, hostile to queer populations, seated in government &#8211; and an upswing in harassment. And yes, even in the supposed &#8220;bubble&#8221; of Berlin, there are <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/is-berlin-s-gay-population-experiencing-a-backlash-1.3578454">fresh worries</a> about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/12/germany-berlin-gay-life/578653/">repression</a>. (Happily, the Pride March here in Berlin also this weekend was a peaceful event, even with 1 million attendees.)  This year was the 50th anniversary of the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots">Stonewall Riots</a> &#8211; and a reminder that the root of the event wasn&#8217;t a party, but political demonstrations by people whose safety was threatened.</p>



<p>That puts Dance with Pride&#8217;s efforts in a new light &#8211; that of a shared, international cause.  So it&#8217;s wonderful seeing a mix of albums and interventions, English, Dutch, Somali, and Derija languages.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s tune in. Select Facebook videos first, then Mixcloud audio links for everything at bottom (including if you disable Facebook content &#8211; and good for you, heh).</p>

<p>It started as an artist tool, but it could become yours, as well. Grainstation-C is a free and open source sound creation workstation that&#8217;s playable live and supports ambisonic spatial sound. And the music its creators makes is ethereal and wonderful.</p>



<p>Micah Frank, noted sound designer and toolmaker as well as composer/musician, produced Grainstation-C for his own work but has expanded it to an open source offering for everybody. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this one for a while, and I think it could appeal both to people looking for a unique tool as well as those wanting to learn a bit more about granular sound in Csound. </p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/chronopolis5k/Grainstation-C">https://github.com/chronopolis5k/Grainstation-C</a> [link + full installation instructions, etc.]</p>



<p><a href="http://csound.com/download.html">http://csound.com/download.html</a> [requisite Csound install]</p>



<p><strong>The engine: </strong>4 streams from disk, 3 streams from live input. Live audio looping, multiple grain controls, six independent pitch delay lines, six switchable low- and high-pass filters. Snapshot saving. </p>



<p><strong>Powered by: </strong>Csound, the modern free and open source sound creation tool that evolved from the grandparent of all digital audio tools. </p>



<p><strong>Live control: </strong>It&#8217;s pre-mapped to the eminently useful Novation LaunchControl XL MK2, but you could easily remap it to other MIDI controllers if you prefer.</p>



<p><strong>Ambisonics:</strong> This optional spatial audio processing lets you use a standard format to adapt to immersive sound environments &#8211; <em>in three-dee! </em>Or not, as you like.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Grainstation-C | Free, Granular Performance Workstation with Ambisonics (3D, Spatial Audio)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQ5MSDqFaX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s deep stuff &#8211; even with different granular modes and controls (time stretching, frame animation, pitch shifting). The inspiration, says Micah, was the now-discontinued System Concrète, a complete MakeNoise modular rig that combined grains with modulation, filtering, and delays. But &#8211; as is easily possible with software, unconstrained by knobs and space and money &#8211; he kept going from there.</p>



<p>Equally notable is the ethereal, beautiful album <em>Quetico</em> that also debuts this week, on Micah&#8217;s own Puremagnetik record label. Once, the line between toolmakers and musicians, engineers and composers was thought sacred &#8211; even with elaborate explanations about why the two couldn&#8217;t be compared. But just as electronic artists have demolished other sacred walls (club and concert, for instance), Micah is part of a generation doing away with those old prejudices.</p>



<p>And the results are richly sensual &#8211; warm waves of sound processed from Yellowstone geysers and Big Sur nights, Micah says. It&#8217;s classic ambient music, and the tool simply melts away, the essential craft of delivering a palette of sound. At the same time, being transparent with the tools is the ultimate confidence in one&#8217;s own musical invention. Micah&#8217;s Puremagnetik was a business built in making sounds for others, and yet both the album and free tool suggest the limitless possibility of that act of sharing.</p>

<p>In any event, this is acousmatic creation of the finest quality, with or without the GitHub link. And Micah is getting some deserved recognition, too, with a 2019 New York Foundation award for the Arts Fellow in Music and Sound.</p>



<p>With so much of the sound out of my country of origin the United States ugly, it&#8217;s wonderful to hear beautiful algorithmic sounds derived from the nation&#8217;s national parks instead.</p>

<p>Novation are going patch crazy, with 1000 free artist patches for their Peak synth and newest Summit. And they come from some of our favorite artists.</p>



<p>&#8220;Presets,&#8221; &#8220;artists,&#8221; blah blah&#8230; but wait, the lineup here includes Legowelt, Craig Williams, Lightbath, Hinako Omori, Emily Sprague, and Shawn Rudiman, plus others to be announced.</p>



<p>Novation use their Components Web interface to deliver updates, content, and expanded functionality to their users, and they&#8217;ve been pioneers in innovative use of the tech for that role. That interface has sometimes been in need of a refresh, though, and so the other big news is that they&#8217;ve overhauled the UI. </p>



<p>Now you can see the Bank Editor next to content, you can filter presets, and you can choose to see your own stuff alongside Novation&#8217;s if you choose. Plus &#8211; mercifully &#8211; login isn&#8217;t mandatory any more (though you&#8217;ll need it to authenticate your own content you store online, of course).</p>



<p>Peak and Summit are well suited to some clever patch design, what with multiple synthesis methods simultaneously, modulation, and effects. It&#8217;ll be interested to see what they&#8217;ve cooked up.</p>

<p>Hardware or software? Yes. Modular synthesizers, of all things, are blurring the line between the two. The popular Vult line of software modules for VCV Rack is going hardware, just as Erica Synths offers its popular <em>hardware</em> in a free software form on the same platform.</p>



<p>VCV Rack has rapidly established itself as a platform for other modules in a way that nothing else has. The software modular is free, with a rich free ecosystem, with only useful add-ons (from the developer and third parties) costing money. It&#8217;s also strikingly approachable for developers as well as users.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s in turn leading to some fascinating crossovers.</p>



<p>This week, developer Leonardo Laguna Ruiz announced that his Vult module, which existed only in VCV Rack virtually, is now up for preorders as actual hardware. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/freakhardware.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93608" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/freakhardware.jpg 709w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/freakhardware-222x300.jpg 222w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></figure>



<p>Vult Freak incorporates a bunch of different modules in one (thanks, code modeling):</p>



<ul><li>Tangents &#8211; Steiner-Parker filter containing three different variations.</li><li>Lateralus &#8211; Ladder filter.</li><li>Nurage &#8211; Low pass gate / Borg filter.</li><li>Ferox &#8211; CMOS filter.</li><li>Vortex &#8211; Russian fitler.</li><li>Unstabile &#8211; Circuit bent State Variable filter.</li><li>Stabile &#8211; State Variable filter.</li><li>Rescomb &#8211; Resonant Comb filter.</li><li>Vorg &#8211; MS-20 style filter</li></ul>



<p>Demos:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I&#8217;ve used a lot of these in my own musical experiments in Rack, and do they sound good? Yes, they do. (Unstabile and Vortex are particularly delicious for those of us who enjoy rich, manic distortion.)</p>



<p>€225 buys you this stuff as physical device &#8211; and frees you from having to mouse around and worry about crashes or running out of CPU, natch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_side.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93611" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_side.jpg 980w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_side-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_side-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /><figcaption>A community of followers built on the VCV Rack ecosystem now are likely to follow Vult on into hardware. Preorder-ready hardware, seen here. </figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_filters-1024x687.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93606" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_filters-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_filters-768x515.jpg 768w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_filters-300x201.jpg 300w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/vult_filters.jpg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the story behind the device that&#8217;s just as compelling &#8211; a few years developing a language, a couple of years experimenting in VCV Rack, then making the leap into hardware. There&#8217;s a bug that bites people who get into buying Eurorack, but there&#8217;s one for development, too. </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that some of the loyal users of the software will splurge for the hardware, too. And rather than blowing cash on something, then bolting it into a rack and hoping you can figure it out, the software-first model means many people who do buy Vult Freak will already know how to use it.</p>



<p>With that in mind, it&#8217;s also worth mention that Latvian titan of modular Erica Synths, with their expansive catalog, have made their first steps into providing software editions. Head to the Library on the VCV site, and you can grab a collection of Erica modules:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/erica-1024x771.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93607" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/erica-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/erica-768x578.jpg 768w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/erica-300x226.jpg 300w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/erica.jpg 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The new Erica offers, in software form &#8211; Wavetable VCO and Octasource from the Black series, and DRUMS from the Pico series.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://vcvrack.com/plugins.html">https://vcvrack.com/plugins.html</a></p>



<p>They&#8217;re free of charge; just click &#8216;+ Free&#8217; and update Rack and you&#8217;ll get them. Erica are a long way from porting everything they make in hardware &#8211; this is a tiny fraction of the full lineup. But they&#8217;re a decent taste of what Erica hardware can do. The Black Wavetable VCO is a uniquely capable oscillator with bitcrush and tons of wave modulation options. Octasource is a unique modulation oscillator, and its interface works differently from others, meaning having it in software form is really fantastic. DRUMS is ridiculously compact as is everything in the fascinating Pico series, but it&#8217;s a natural for cramming into virtual rigs.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ericasynths.lv/">https://www.ericasynths.lv/</a></p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be curious to see if this attracts some new Erica customers. Erica aren&#8217;t the first to do this, either &#8211; Befaco, Mutable Instruments (as Audible Instruments), and Music Thing (as Stellare) all offer software renditions of their hardware. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine at some point that VCV Rack will have a &#8220;buy hardware&#8221; button on the software. Softube Modular has software ports, too, of some big brands &#8211; Mutable Instruments again, the mighty Doepfer, Buchla, 4ms, and Intellijel all have software modules available. </p>



<p>The big difference is business model: VCV Rack is tending more toward either inexpensive paid modules as software, or free software that serves as a demo/preview of hardware.  </p>



<p>A minority of electronic musicians live in a place where they can easily just run to a shop and try gear out. But more than that, software promises to create a new communications link between musicians and creators, year-round. We&#8217;ll see if that gives Vult a boost in the crowded modular world.</p>



<p>Check out VCV Rack on all platforms:</p>



<p><a href="https://vcvrack.com/">https://vcvrack.com/</a></p>



<p>And if you want a hand getting started, the legendary Jim Aikin has written a free e-book that explains what Rack is and how to use it, plus (the bit I liked most) gives a guide to the jungle of modules out there:</p>

<p>Interactive visuals in the browser now make stunning eye candy live that used to require whole server farms to render. cables.gl &#8211; now in a free open beta &#8211; lets you harness that, without even knowing how to code.</p>



<p>cables.gl is a dataflow (visual patching) development environment that runs entirely in the browser &#8211; using the latest 3D capabilities of computer GPUs. That means it&#8217;s something you can mess with right from inside your browser of choice, and that you can deliver in the same environment &#8211; so, say, create an immersive music video someone can access from any computer. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/holdon1-1024x500.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93552" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/holdon1-1024x500.jpg 1024w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/holdon1-768x375.jpg 768w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/holdon1-300x147.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><a href="https://holon.drastic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="HOLON (opens in a new tab)">HOLON</a> &#8211; &#8220;Hold On.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s also a great gateway drug or complement to desktop-oriented environments like TouchDesigner and vvvv. (Once you start thinking in this sort of flow, some ideas translate &#8211; and something like TouchDesigner is a better choice if you need to output to, say, a heavy-duty desktop or five for large-scale projections.)</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve written about cables.gl before, but you had to request an invite. They&#8217;ve now opened up to a public beta, so anyone can register. I&#8217;m sure some people in the CDM audience will do some amazing stuff with it. Just be sure to let us know when you do.</p>

<p><a href="https://cables.gl/">https://cables.gl/</a></p>



<p>Also, the cables.gl devs tell me they&#8217;ve finished up more videos showing how to work with music software. I&#8217;ve added those to our most recent story:</p>



<p>The visuals here, by the way, come from this gorgeous music video by Holon (and a nice tune, too):</p>

<p>It&#8217;s liberating &#8211; just take your phone or tablet, plug in a USB cable, and you can make music on this hardware synth anywhere. Here&#8217;s how to do that, with our <a href="https://meeblip.com/collections/our-products/products/meeblip-geode-synthesizer">MeeBlip geode</a>, plus some tips on the best apps for both iOS and Android.</p>



<p>Inspiration is a funny thing, and somehow in the process of hunting around for interfaces and power sockets, you can wind up staring at a tangle of cables and no idea of what it was you were trying to do. So, I&#8217;m already finding it surprisingly empowering to be able to use the new USB port on the MeeBlip geode for both power and MIDI (sequencing notes and control). Every smartphone I&#8217;ve tested, plus the iPad, will gladly power the geode from the same connection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/meeblipmobile.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93531" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/meeblipmobile.jpg 960w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/meeblipmobile-768x498.jpg 768w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/meeblipmobile-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></figure>



<p>Why not just use an app? Well, with the geode plugged in, you get some nice feeling knobs and switches, plus that grimy, dirty MeeBlip sound &#8211; and its screaming analog filter. To look at it the other way, all you need for different interfaces for playing this module, from step sequencers to touch keyboards, is your handy mobile gadget.</p>



<p>That also led me on a search for the best apps that support MIDI out. Not all do, Apple&#8217;s own GarageBand for iOS being notably incapable of the feat (unlike its Mac sibling). I also spoke with Ashley Elsdon, our resident mobile geek, for additional tips. So these apps will be working with lots of my other MIDI gear, too. And while I thought the Huawei Android handheld that I just got to replace my iPhone would leave me disappointed as far as music apps, I was glad to find some excellent Android-platform stuff, too. (For once, we don&#8217;t have to leave y&#8217;all out.)</p>



<p>First, here are a couple of jams on iOS, audio straight from the out jack of the MeeBlip. And these two I think count as my two favorite live performance tools for iOS (so far):</p>

<p><strong>StepPolyArp </strong>may have been one of the first music apps I got for the iPad, actually. It&#8217;s an intuitive, deep combination of a piano roll editor for graphically drawing patterns, an arpeggiator, and a step sequencer. It syncs to Ableton Link, though I&#8217;ve also used plain MIDI clock. And yes, you can get grimy sounds out of geode, in case you didn&#8217;t know that.</p>

<p><strong>Arpeggionome Pro</strong> has a unique grid (influenced by the likes of the Tenori-On), and runs on both iPhone and iPad &#8211; it&#8217;s great handheld. Because of its particular approach to harmony and rhythm, it can lead you to some patterns you&#8217;d never play on a normal arpeggiator, let alone on a keyboard (unless you&#8217;re seriously some kind of pinball wizard). And yes, it also boasts Ableton Link support, so you can wireless sync up to another app or computer running lots of different software (not just Ableton Live). </p>



<p>It&#8217;s also on iOS, though <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alexandernaut.arpio&amp;hl=en_US">ARPIO</a> is an Android port from the original developer, and just lacks MIDI support &#8211; please, please!</p>

<h3>More app ideas</h3>



<p>On Android, there&#8217;s a powerful MIDI sequencer/arpeggiator toolkit that lets you build your own patterns:</p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=midi.midi.midi.looper.free&amp;hl=en_US">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=midi.midi.midi.looper.free&amp;hl=en_US</a></p>



<p>Wildly enough, you can even use the Virtual ANS, a reimagining of a vintage Soviet synth, with MIDI output. The developer tells me he&#8217;s working on bringing that same MIDI output to his excellent tracker/production tool <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nightradio.sunvox&amp;hl=en">SunVox</a>, where it makes more sense:</p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nightradio.virtualans3">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nightradio.virtualans3</a></p>



<p>Various production tools on Android also do MIDI output, though perhaps the easiest to use would be <a href="http://www.humatic.de/htools/touchdaw/">Touch DAW</a>, which simply acts as a general-purpose MIDI controller for everything &#8211; including a keyboard.</p>



<p>iOS is as usual richer with options. Ashley / Palm Sounds recommends considering MIDI plug-ins, too.</p>



<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apematrix/id1378343729">apeMatrix</a> as host + AUv3 MIDI plug-ins </p>



<p><a href="http://ruismaker.com/odessa/">Rozeta</a> sequencer suite from our friend Ruismaker (or if you want to get really fancy, try scripting your own MIDI with <a href="https://cdm.link/2019/05/mozaic-scriptable-midi-ipad-iphone/">Mozaic</a>)</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s <a href="https://alexandernaut.com/fuguemachine/">Fugue Machine</a>, also from Alexandernaut who built Arpeggionome above, which could be wild. I might have to try that with multiple MeeBlips, uh, fuguing. Stay tuned. </p>



<p>Or think of <a href="http://modstep.net/">Modstep</a>, a powerful sequencer with scene triggering</p>



<h3>What do you need for the connection?</h3>



<p>On many new Android devices, you can actually plug a cable directly between your phone (USB-C) and the MeeBlip (USB-B). Otherwise, you&#8217;ll need a USB OTG adapter. These run about ten bucks (ah, this obviously <em>isn&#8217;t</em> from Apple).</p>



<p>On iOS with only Lightning connections, you need an adapter. The best of these is Apple&#8217;s Lightning to USB3 Camera Connection Kit. It&#8217;s pricey, but it gives you both a USB-A and a separate Lightning breakout, so you can power your iPad or iPhone and connect USB at the same time, rather than drain the battery. It&#8217;s reliable enough to use live onstage, and it&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll see me using in these images.</p>



<p>Of course, on a computer with a standard USB connection, you don&#8217;t need any special adapters.</p>



<p>Regardless, you&#8217;re sure to be able to quickly connect your MeeBlip in the studio or at home, <em>and</em> you can even mess around with ideas on the go or busk at the park or picnic. </p>

<p>Sony&#8217;s Walkman turned 40 earlier this month. But look to the TC-50 before it for some of the technology and usability innovations that changed the world &#8211; and joined the Apollo mission &#8211; plus a glimpse of where music might boldly go next.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/tc-50.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93510" srcset="https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/tc-50.jpg 736w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2019/07/tc-50-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></figure>



<p>Sony&#8217;s story will sound familiar to a lot of today&#8217;s sound DIYers, synth makers, and Eurorack inventors. The <a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/SonyHistory/1-01.html">operation began</a> with a cheap disused space and a few people learning on the job by repairing electronics. The company might be known for transforming cassettes, but earlier projects involved a rice cooker and an electric cushion.</p>



<p>But long before Apple, it was Sony that introduced the world &#8211; and especially the lucrative American market &#8211; to the idea of miniaturized portable electronics. That included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-55">TR series</a> transistor radio. (Oh, note the other similarity &#8211; yes, it&#8217;s a safe bet that Roland&#8217;s Western-friendly brand name and XX-NNN product names are inspired by the likes of Sony and Sanyo.)</p>



<p>And that brings us to the TC series cassette recorders. There&#8217;s really a lot in these devices that predicts not only the Walkman, but devices like the iPhone, as well. As with transistor radios, miniaturized electronics enable a design that becomes personal and portable, which changes the whole relationship of user to device. </p>



<p>The 1968 TC-50 looks elegant and modern even by today&#8217;s standards. It combines a number of key innovations that make that possible &#8211; not necessarily invented by Sony or by the TC-50, but combined in a single product in a way that transforms that technology into user experience:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Sony&#039;s proto-Walkman that went to the moon*" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJXRVyszFbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Integrated circuits.</strong>  ICs are what has brought us the entire consumer electronics &#8211; and musical electronics &#8211; revolution. The chip replaces whole circuits of separate components. On the TC-50, that lets the design revolve around the user&#8217;s hand, the controls, the mic, and the cassette &#8211; everything else more or less disappears. Sony began in the 50s designing its own components, thanks to tech it had licensed from Bell.</p>



<p><strong>Compact component mounting. </strong>This is actually equally as big a deal &#8211; each component&#8217;s mounts are also reduced, which further miniaturizes the design.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in microphone. </strong>This is the innovation that&#8217;s the reason the TC-50 went into space &#8211; and while we take it for granted now, it&#8217;s what cleared a pathway for the likes of the iPhone. Sony&#8217;s custom mic design is small, integrated with the device, but still records high-quality audio. When NASA equipped its astronauts with the TC-50, it was for personal memo recording, not mix tapes (though more on the latter in a moment). That personal functionality also establishes the handheld device as a portable companion. If that seems a stretch when talking about the iPhone (even with &#8220;phone&#8221; in the title), I might also observe that Apple has told me its Voice Memos app is one of its most popular. </p>



<p><strong>One-handed, wireless operation. </strong>Here&#8217;s the other big innovation that brings it all together. The entire design &#8211; placement and operation of buttons, form factor &#8211; is built to enable one-handed operation. Just as with so many accessibility innovations, that in turn yields unexpected advantages. In the case of the TC-50, it meant astronauts could record audio while wearing their bulky spacesuit gloves, starting with Apollo 7 and most famously on the Apollo 11 moon voyage. That kind of usability thinking would go on to inspire companies like Apple, and it&#8217;s always worth revisiting. (When I worked on <a href="https://mominstruments.com/wretchup-playable-delay/">WretchUp with Mouse on Mars</a>, I did a lot of adjustment work with Andi to design gestural controls that you could use with a single hand, and even without looking closely at the device, for onstage use.) </p>



<p><strong>Natural industrial design, focused on materials. </strong>You can almost hear Jony Ive marveling at the luxurious, exposed &#8220;aluminium&#8221; &#8211; and yes, years before he met Ive, Steve Jobs also saw Sony as a personal design inspiration (alongside Braun and Mercedes-Benz). The TC-50 came too soon to benefit from the 21st Century&#8217;s economy of scale, so you can bet the &#8220;luxury&#8221; of that aluminum surface had a price tag attached. But Sony excelled at modern adoption of these material processes, which had allowed it to work with companies like watchmaker Bulova back to the TR-55 transistor radio. And so it is that today&#8217;s smartphones also telegraph their use of strong materials. See also <a href="http://www.walkmancentral.com/products/tc-55">this excellent story on the 1972 TC-55</a>, which starts to look more like a Walkman, and moves public perception from &#8220;cheap plastic&#8221; to &#8220;fine metal.&#8221;</p>



<h3>Apollo and the TC-50</h3>



<p>NASA astronauts definitely used portable cassette recorders, the Sony TC-50 being one. They also made famous use of a modified Hasselblad 70mm film camera, including on the lunar landing during Apollo 11 (see <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/camera-hasselblad-70mm-apollo-11">National Air and Space Museum</a>).</p>



<p>I found some differing accounts of which missions the recorder was aboard. Sony themselves note the TC-50 debuted on <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/camera-hasselblad-70mm-apollo-11">Apollo 7</a>, the mission that was the first Apollo to carry a crew (and the first human spaceflight mission after the conclusion of Gemini and the tragic Apollo 1 launchpad fire). The TC-50 also got pretty close to the moon on Apollo 10, the key mission that <a href="https://www.space.com/17590-apollo-10.html">simulated the lunar descent</a>.</p>



<p>From the accounts I&#8217;ve read, it sounds as though there was a TC-50 on Apollo 11, but it probably didn&#8217;t go &#8220;to the moon&#8221; in that it seems it stayed aboard the Apollo Command Module, not the Lunar Module that made the trip to the moon&#8217;s surface. And Buzz Aldrin did request a mix of music for the trip, dubbed to the compact cassette format of the TC-50. </p>

<p><em>Vanity Fair</em> learned the details of the Apollo 11 mixtape from record exec Mickey Kapp in an interview late last year:</p>

<p>They made the essential playlist for Spotify, natch:</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed?uri=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A1Qknpppde6jf7jEMP6bGmC" width="300" height="380"></iframe></figure>



<p>One Aldrin favorite, now featured in the upcoming documentary on the mission, is this poignant &#8211; and self-critical, self-aware, hardly jingoistic &#8211;  John Stewart release:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Mother Country" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Z5G2XZy1_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing particularly cosmic in the mix; the choices are sentimental, personal. When they go to the lunar theme, they&#8217;re lush and romantic as much as trippy. And they&#8217;re singular; this isn&#8217;t background music. I think that says something about our connection to music, something that generative tunes or machine learning are unlikely ever to replace &#8211; they&#8217;re still, you know, <em>songs</em>. </p>



<p>The mix for Buzz was made in a living room, reports <em>VF</em>, complete with mistakes. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been unquestionably lost, and even at the time  must have stood in contrast to the mission-critical clockwork of a space mission. </p>



<p>I wonder, though, if the TC-50 doesn&#8217;t point us to a fresh perspective on music. Right now, so much of our thinking about how music should be shared is stuck in the past. Whether lamenting the loss of tangible media and record stores, or defending them by stalwartly DJing with &#8220;vinyl only&#8221; sets, the whole conversation is framed by what was.</p>



<p>The TC-50, apart from having been aboard humankind&#8217;s most audacious mission yet out of our planet&#8217;s orbit, isn&#8217;t bound by any of that past. It&#8217;s informed by watchmaking-quality metals and the iteration of electronics. But it&#8217;s designed anew around the best quality of each of those disciplines. It looks familiar and inevitable to us only because we are the children of the age it shaped.</p>



<p>That is to say, maybe the first and most reasonable answer to the question of &#8220;what should music listening look like in the future&#8221; might well be <em>I don&#8217;t know</em>. The people at Sony didn&#8217;t know right away. They cut their teeth on rice cookers in the wreckage of a ruined empire, dug deep into the latest advances from Bell in the USA, and spent incalculable hours just disassembling someone else&#8217;s electronics, and putting them back together so they worked again. Sony&#8217;s first introduction to the cassette was hitting on a technology that improved on primitive wire recorders they&#8217;d seen in military use. Apollo for its part was built on iterations from missiles and ran on computers whose memory was woven together, literally, by textile workers. </p>



<p>We live in an era that values fast answers and quick financial returns, but the very breakthroughs that make those people so rich weren&#8217;t brainstormed in a coworking center on a whiteboard by someone microdosing LSD. They were crafted over years through hands-on, sweat and tears work on physical materials and engineering. </p>



<p>Maybe we don&#8217;t need new devices or new physical media for sound &#8211; that&#8217;s possible. We&#8217;ll certainly need devices to record sound and to play music; anything that must be touched can&#8217;t simply be streamed.</p>



<p>I suspect, too, that we may see new devices for listening, built around new developments in immersive sound.    </p>



<p>I also think it&#8217;s telling that the TC-50 was a recording and creation device as well as listening device, and that those functions were ultimately linked. The smartphone fits that mold, of course &#8211; but other as-yet-undreamt-of devices could go there, as well, in ways the smartphone can&#8217;t. </p>



<p>So why not return to some of that day-in, day-out engineering and craft to find the next big thing?</p>



<p>Some of the TC-50s still work, too:</p>

<p>PS &#8211; I have no idea what kind of audio or film equipment was used aboard Soviet missions of this period, so maybe my Russian friends or space buffs can answer that.</p>
