			<description>Channeling Mother Nature into built form, Mexican architect Javier Senosiain designed a peanut-shaped bespoke home with nary a straight line in sight. Appropriately named Casa Orgánica (or Organic House), the home stands out from its suburban surroundings near Mexico City with its curvaceous shape, hobbit-like entryway and a semi-submerged construction. The home, which was built in 1984 and expanded upon a few years later, is the first organic architecture project by Senosiain.[...]</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Channeling Mother Nature into built form, Mexican architect <a href="https://www.arquitecturaorganica.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Javier Senosiain</a> designed a peanut-shaped bespoke home with nary a straight line in sight. Appropriately named Casa Orgánica (or Organic House), the home stands out from its suburban surroundings near Mexico City with its curvaceous shape, hobbit-like entryway and a semi-submerged construction. The home, which was built in 1984 and expanded upon a few years later, is the first organic architecture project by Senosiain.</p>

<p>Spanning an area of 1,873 square feet, the Organic House was constructed with a rounded rebar skeleton filled with mortar, coated with sprayed polyurethane for insulation and waterproofing and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/green-roof/">covered in grass</a> to disguise the building as a green dune that blends into the rolling lawn landscape. Taking inspiration from the shape of a peanut shell, Senosiain organized the home as two ovate spaces — one for the living room, dining area and kitchen and the other for the bedroom and bathroom — unified by a curved hallway.</p>

<p>The entrance is attached to the living area and marked by a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/hobbit/">hobbit</a>-like round door framed by a dense fringe of foliage. The interior feels distinctly cavernous with its rounded surfaces. Yet despite the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/cave-architecture">cave-like</a>, semi-underground interior, the home is full of light thanks to the insertion of large, curved windows that frame a variety of outdoor views. </p>

<p>“The original concept is defined in two large spaces: one day and one night, looking for the feeling that inside the person will enter the land, that was aware of the uniqueness of this space without losing integration with the exterior green areas,” Senosiain said. “The green dune is the envelope of the interior volume that is almost invisible. From the outside we only see grass, shrubs, trees and flowers. Walking on the garden is walking on the roof of the house without realizing it.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owner of Holiday Inn, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), has pledged to do away with the convenient but wasteful mini shampoo and soap bottles that are a staple in its 843,000 guest rooms. IHG owns more than 5,600 hotels around the world and announced that it will phase out the small plastic bottles and opt for bulk-sized containers <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/corporate-responsibility">for all its hotels</a> by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>According to the corporation, it uses over 200 million mini <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a> bottles every year. Keith Barr, CEO of IHG, said, &#8220;Switching to larger-size amenities across more than 5,600 hotels around the world is a big step in the right direction and will allow us to significantly reduce our waste footprint and environmental impact as we make the change.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/companies-pledge-1-5-billion-to-reduce-plastic-waste/">Related: Companies pledge $1.5 billion to reduce plastic waste</a></p>
<p>IHG is the first global <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/hotels">hotel</a> corporation of its size to make this promise.</p>
<p>According to Barr, the announcement is also related to the national and local governments&#8217; inability to pass stricter sustainability regulations. &#8220;We collectively as an industry have to lead where governments are not necessarily giving the leadership to make a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to its interest in sustainability, the corporation’s board is also looking to attract more customers who are increasingly concerned about the environment. According to a survey sponsored by Hilton, a third of customers researched the company’s sustainability policies before booking a room. As a result, Hilton announced a pledge to cut its <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-footprint">carbon footprint</a> in half and double its investments in social good.</p>
<p>In addition to eliminating the small plastic bottles, IHG is working to phase out <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/single-use">plastic straws</a> by the end of 2019. A similar pledge was also made by the company&#8217;s competitor, Marriott International.</p>
<p>At least a third of IHG&#8217;s properties have already started using the bulk-sized toiletry dispensers, and the rest are working on the transition. The full phase-out will be completed by 2021.</p>

<p>Winner of <a href="https://www.azuremagazine.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Azure Magazine’s</a> 2019 A+ Student Award, the Geographies of Urban Filth is the thesis project Zhang worked on while pursuing a Master of Architecture at Ontario’s University of Waterloo. </p>

<p>“The thesis studies how our cultural understanding of dirt and cleanliness are bound to issues of class and race and how they are manifested within urban and spatial design,” Zhang said in a project statement. “Boundaries are formed between clean and dirty, familiar and foreign, us and them, through the rejection of matter that is disturbing or threatening to us. The design proposes the breaking down of boundaries between perceived &#8216;clean&#8217; and &#8216;dirty&#8217; spatial and social constructs with the insertion of a public space and bath within the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/wastewater/">wastewater</a> treatment facility.”</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/award-winning-geographies-of-urban-filth-rethinks-waste-in-cities/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Geographies-of-Urban-Filth-by-Liyang-Zhang-3-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Geographies-of-Urban-Filth-by-Liyang-Zhang-5-889x665.jpg" alt="rendering of public baths" class="wp-image-2219321" /></p>
<p>Located near three physically and socially disconnected neighborhoods of mixed income levels and ethnic groups, the North Toronto Wastewater treatment plant served as the perfect vehicle for Zhang’s thesis. The treatment plant’s hidden location within the Don Valley ravine and connection to the sewers evoke a “dirty” image that seems at odds with <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/toronto/">Toronto’s</a> “clean” image. The unusual insertion of a public bath inside the treatment plant would help bring “us in touch with the rejected ‘other’ within the city and within ourselves,” Zhang said.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/award-winning-geographies-of-urban-filth-rethinks-waste-in-cities/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Geographies-of-Urban-Filth-by-Liyang-Zhang-3-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Geographies-of-Urban-Filth-by-Liyang-Zhang-6-889x612.jpg" alt="rendering of people walking near round structures" class="wp-image-2219322" /></p>
<p>Zhang envisioned the wastewater treatment plant as a multifunctional venue with space not only for bathing but for swimming and events as well. The designer embraced the existing brutalist architecture and proposed few modifications, from the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/adaptive-reuse">adaptive reuse</a> of decommissioned digester tanks into an arts and performance venue to the concrete volumes that house the changing rooms and showering facilities. Filtered wastewater would be used for showering and cycled back into the treatment plant for re-filtering before entering the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/wetlands/">wetland</a> swimming pools and a subterranean pool.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden, is faced with a dilemma: how will she get to the U.N. Climate Summit in New York City with out leaving a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-emissions">carbon footprint</a>?</p>
<p> Enter Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi, professional sailors who offered the young activist a ride on their high-speed, zero-emissions sailboat the Malizia II .  </p>
<p>The sailboat journey will take two weeks to reach the New York Climate Summit. After New York, the group will venture on another trip to  Santiago, Chile for the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/UN">U.N.</a> Framework Convention.  </p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/new-report-warns-of-extreme-heat-of-127-degrees-or-more-in-the-us/">Related: New report warns of extreme heat of 127 degrees or more in the US </a></p>
<p>“This is pretty much where our future will be decided. By the year 2020, next year, the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/emissions">emission </a>curve must have been bended steep downwards if we are to have a change to stay below 1.5 or 2 degrees of warming,” said Thunberg of the U.N. events.</p>
<p>The crew has warned Thunberg the trip will not be glamorous, including no access to showers, air conditioning, refrigeration or fresh meals. There is also a chance that the seas could be rough. </p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her if she was scared and she explained in a very analytical way that she thinks this voyage is safe, the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/boat">boat </a>has a lot of safety systems and is capable of sailing around the world in a race and therefore it’s a strong boat,” says Herrmann.</p>
<p>The sailboat, Malizia II is one of only a few zero-emissions sailboats of its size in the world. It has <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-panels">solar panels</a> and underwater turbines that generate electricity while the ship is sailing.</p>
<p>Thunberg’s father will also be aboard the ship for the journey, along with a filmmaker to document their adventure.</p>
<p>Thunberg has taken a year off from school in order to focus on her work as an outspoken <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">climate</a> activist.</p>

</ul>
<p>The new cross-border <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/transportation">cable car</a> line will connect the northern Chinese city of Heihe with the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk. Separated by the Amur River that has formed a boundary between Russia and China since the mid-19th century, the two cities belong to a free trade zone and have historically been trading partners, particularly when the Amur River freezes over to allow passage by foot.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/unstudio-designs-terminal-for-worlds-first-cross-border-cable-car-connecting-russia-with-china/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Blagoveshchensk-Cable-Terminal-by-UNStudio-8-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Blagoveshchensk-Cable-Terminal-by-UNStudio-6-889x500.jpg" alt="rendering of large white building with cable cars" class="wp-image-2219281" /></p>
<p>The frozen Amur river as a platform for trade and commerce inspired UNStudio’s winning Cable Car Terminal design, which aims to build social connections between the two cultures. As a result, the terminal will feature diverse programming and curated views of both cities. The angular building will also comprise a series of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/green-terrace">landscaped terraces</a> to create a new shared urban space — dubbed the Urban Tribune — that will serve as a cultural focal point on the waterfront for Blagoveschensk. </p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/the-worlds-first-vertical-cable-car-will-climb-to-a-height-of-138-meters-in-the-uk/">Related: The “world’s first vertical cable car” will climb to a height of 138 meters in the UK </a></p>
<p>“As it crosses the natural border of the Amur River, the Blagoveshchensk &#8211; Heihe cable car will be the first ever cable car system to join two countries and cultures,” van Berkel said in a project statement. “This context provided rich inspiration for the Blagoveshchensk terminal station, which not only responds to its immediate urban location but also becomes an expression of cultural identity and a podium for the intermingling of cultures.”</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/unstudio-designs-terminal-for-worlds-first-cross-border-cable-car-connecting-russia-with-china/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Blagoveshchensk-Cable-Terminal-by-UNStudio-8-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Blagoveshchensk-Cable-Terminal-by-UNStudio-7-889x533.jpg" alt="rendering of cable cars at dusk" class="wp-image-2219282" /></p>
<p>The cable car line will comprise two lines and four cabins — each with a capacity of 60 passengers and extra space for luggage — and can whisk passengers from one city to the other in less than eight minutes.</p>

<p>Located in Kalaloch, Washington between the Olympic Coast at the Hoh Rainforest, the Hoh Rainforest Caravan Cabins are one of many nature-focused vacation rentals offered by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Glamping Hub (opens in a new tab)" href="https://glampinghub.com" target="_blank">Glamping Hub</a>, an online third-party booking platform for unique outdoor accommodations. Thanks to a recent partnership with Red Awning, the world’s largest collection of vacation properties, the glamping company now lists over 30,000 accommodations on its website in over 120 countries. The rentals range from caravan cabins to safari tents, tree houses, domes, tipis and more.</p>

<p>As with Glamping Hub’s other listings, the Hoh Rainforest Caravan Cabins were selected by the company for their “hotel-quality comfort” and ability to offer guests a “unique experience.” Although all basic amenities are included—including hot water, electricity, a fridge, and a stocked kitchenette—the rentals minimize their environmental footprint with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="renewable energy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/environment/renewable-energy" target="_blank">renewable energy</a> supply and self-contained, compostable toilets. Guests can also enjoy access to communal areas on the property, such as a campfire site.</p>

<p>“The unique location and privacy of the wooded forest allow for a truly magical experience on the Olympic Peninsula where lodging is very limited,” says Glamping Hub’s listing description. “Glampers can look forward to a starlit night by the campfire and a re-energizing full night sleep on a cozy queen size mattress. Friends and kids are welcome with both three-person and four-person accommodations available.” The property includes three units with a 10 guest capacity. <a href="https://glampinghub.com/unitedstatesofamerica/pacificwest/washington/kalaloch/glamping-getaway-hoh-rainforest-washington/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bookings start at $284.30 per night.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethiopia broke the world’s tree-planting record by planting more than 350 million trees in just one day. The effort is part of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s Green Legacy Initiative, which aims to address <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">climate change</a> and deforestation.</p>
<p>The goal of the program is to plant more than four billion indigenous <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/trees">trees</a> throughout the country. It has already <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/07/31/ethiopia-bids-plant-four-billion-trees-green-push/">reportedly</a> planted three billion, and last week’s efforts made significant progress toward meeting the target. </p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/scientists-confirm-tree-planting-is-our-best-solution-to-climate-change/">Related: Scientists confirm tree planting is our best solution to climate change</a></p>
<p>Some government offices were shut down for the day to allow staff to participate in the planting efforts. Representatives from the United Nations, African Union and foreign embassies also came out to support the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re halfway to our goal,&#8221; the prime minister announced midway through the planting day, and he encouraged Ethiopians to continue the work in the remaining time. He later announced on Twitter they had not only met the &#8220;collective #GreenLegacy goal&#8221; but exceeded it.</p>
<p>The prime minister is hopeful that he can reach his final target if every citizen plants 40 seedlings. The government is running educational videos about planting and maintaining trees to encourage citizens to join in. The biggest concern for young seedlings is grazing by goats and other <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/livestock">livestock</a> that would destroy the trees before they have a chance to grow.</p>
<p>Ethiopia’s forest cover is alarmingly low and plummeted over the last few decades. At the start of the 20th century, the country had approximately 35 percent forest cover, but that number dropped to just 4 percent in 2000. Over <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/africa/ethiopia-plants-350-million-trees-intl-hnk/index.html">80 percent</a> of Ethiopians rely on <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/agriculture">agriculture</a> or forest products for their income.</p>
<p>“I think we demonstrated the capacity for people to come together collectively and deliver on a shared vision,” said Billene Seyoum, Ahmed’s press secretary.</p>
<p>The previous record for <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/tree-planting">tree planting</a> was held by India, where 66 million trees were planted in one day in 2017.</p>

<p>Surrounded by prolific wildlife, the Jao Camp features a main area elevated into the tree canopy. “Underpinning it all is our commitment to the pristine environment around Jao, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-footprint/">minimizing our footprint</a> and allowing our guests to experience the Delta in its fullest sense,” the Wilderness Safaris’ website reads. “Innovative insulation ensures comfort, while gauze and glass panels let natural light and the outside in. The suites and villas are cooled with a silent evaporative cooler at a fraction of energy used by conventional air conditioning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jao Camp is also 100 percent <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-power">solar</a>-powered and draws energy from a new power plant that works on one of the world’s biggest Victron inverter systems and the largest lithium-ion battery bank in southern Africa. During the colder months, the suites are warmed by innovative, self-igniting Calore fireplaces fueled with pellets made from sawdust, a byproduct of working natural wood, without any additives or caking agents.</p>

<p>All of Jao Camp’s contemporary luxury suites come with private plunge pools, lounge and dining areas, en suite bathrooms and outdoor and indoor showers. The nature-inspired color palette and use of handcrafted natural materials, such as rosewood-clad ceilings and floors, help tie the interiors to the outdoors and keep the focus on the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/okavango-delta/">Okavango Delta</a>. Moreover, the newly added Center of Knowledge museum and gallery shares information about the area, its history and its denizens.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California is the first state to work directly with the United Nations on a natural infrastructure insurance program that could help protect communities from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/wildfire" target="_blank">wildfires</a> and other disasters.</p>
<p>The California Department of Insurance is working on a year long initiative with the United Nation’s <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environment">Environment</a> Program to develop insurance practices that manage and reduce risks, specifically related to wetlands and forests. </p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/every-year-humanity-overshoots-the-natural-resources-earth-can-replenish/">Related: Every year, humanity ‘overshoots’ the natural resources earth can replenish</a></p>
<p>“We have a historic opportunity to utilize insurance markets to protect Californians from the threat of climate change, including rising <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sea">sea</a> levels, extreme heat and wildfires,” says Insurance Commissioner for California Ricardo Lara. “Working with the United Nations, we can keep California at the forefront of reducing risks while promoting sustainable investments.”</p>
<p>In 2018, California experienced the state’s deadliest wildfire, which cost $12 billion in insurable losses and killed <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/03/camp-fire-death-toll-california-deadliest-wildfire/2199035002/">85</a> people. According to experts, the increased severity of wildfires is likely due to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">climate change</a>. Insurance services can offer compensation for risk reduction strategies, such as effective forest management or protecting utility infrastructure from possible disasters.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sustainable insurance road map will enable California to harness risk reduction measures, insurance solutions and investments by the insurance industry in order to build safer, disaster-resilient communities, and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sustainability">sustainable</a> economy,” said the U.N. lead, Butch Bacani.</p>
<p>Other countries have initiated similar natural infrastructure insurance programs, including protections for <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environments">coral reefs</a> and mangroves, which reduce coastal flooding and erosion.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a person who is serious about protecting the environment, you’re probably conscious of how much trash you generate every time you have a period. In addition to being chock-full of plastics sent straight to landfills, pads and tampons also contain harsh chemicals that are <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/toxic-chemicals">toxic</a>. Yet most people continue exposing their bodies to these products month after month. Luckily, there are better options out there for both you and the planet — here&#8217;s a guide to help you find what might work best for you.</p>
<p>“Anything coming in constant contact with your skin will land in your bloodstream for distribution throughout your body,” Dr. Joseph Mercola wrote in an alarming Huffington Post <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/feminine-hygiene-products_b_3359581">article</a> about the dangers of menstrual products.</p>
<p>Despite the potential dangers, the chemical ingredients in tampons and pads are an industry secret, protected by nondisclosure policies that favor corporations, manufacturers and innovators but put consumers at serious risk.</p>
<p>So if you want to cut down on <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pollution">polluting</a> nature and your body, consider this comprehensive guide on more sustainable product options available right now. As always, be sure to consult with your healthcare provider to help determine the best options for you.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-eco-friendly-period-products/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-2-889x592.jpg" alt="colorful menstrual cups on a black cloth" class="wp-image-2219150" /></p>
<p><h2>Menstrual cups</h2>
</p>
<p>Menstrual cups are one of the most eco-friendly options out there. If you can get over the initial learning curve, they are easy and convenient to use.</p>
<p><h3>Why we love them</h3>
</p>
<p>Although the up-front sticker price is higher, when you calculate how much you spend every month on tampons or pads, the savings are obvious. The cups are comfortable and barely noticeable once they have been inserted — the same way you might get used to a tampon and hardly realize it is there. They are especially easy for <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/travel">travelers</a> who want to save precious space in their luggage and say goodbye to last-minute, emergency trips to the convenience store.</p>
<p>Most cup brands come in multiple sizes and some even come in varying levels of firmness, depending on your preference, flow, age and whether or not you have had a vaginal birth. The cups are capable of handling even heavy flow days, with most users reporting minimal — if any — leaks. Below is a brief review of a few popular brands.</p>
<p><h4>Diva Cup ($35)</h4>
</p>
<p>The Diva Cup is the most recognized and popular brand. It has three sizes (including one for teens), lasts up to 12 hours and is made from medical-grade silicone.</p>
<p><h4>Sustain Natural Period Cup ($39)</h4>
</p>
<p>These cups are flexible, compact and made entirely of medical-grade <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/silicone">silicone</a>. They claim to hold three tampons-worth of liquid and are available in two sizes. This is also the only brand that currently offers a microwave case for cleaning the cup.</p>
<p><h4>Peachlife Menstrual Cup ($22)</h4>
</p>
<p>Also made of medical-grade silicone, this cup uniquely comes in a variety of firmness levels (soft, medium-firm and extra-firm). Unlike other brands that come to a point, the Peachlife cup has a silicone ring at the bottom for easy removal (but remember, you still have to break the suction of the cup; you cannot just tug on the ring!).</p>
<p><h3>Cups are not without challenges</h3>
</p>
<p>Menstrual cups cannot be <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/recycle">recycled</a> at the end of their lifecycles, but when you calculate how many pads and tampons you averted from landfills, this product is worth it.</p>
<p>The cups can also be difficult to maneuver at first. Once you have practiced and get the hang of folding the cup, inserting it and then breaking the seal to remove, it’s just as easy as any other option. It typically takes about three periods to fully adapt to using a menstrual cup.</p>
<p>Because of cultural and religious beliefs, some people do have objections or hesitations to using a cup.</p>

<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-eco-friendly-period-products/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-3-889x592.jpg" alt="black absorbent underwear on white background" class="wp-image-2219151" /></p>
<p><h2>A new spin on &#8216;period underwear&#8217;</h2>
</p>
<p>Absorbent underwear brands like THINX and Lunapads are increasing in popularity and market share. They are simply underwear that you wear during your period that are specially manufactured to absorb menstrual blood.</p>
<p><h3>Why they’re so easy</h3>
</p>
<p>If you know how to put on your undies, then you know how to use these — they have all other products beat in terms of ease of use. They are also eco-friendly, because you wash and reuse them each time you have your period. That means they do not produce <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/landfill">landfill</a> trash every month.</p>
<p><h3>The downside of absorbent underwear</h3>
</p>
<p>Period underwear is more expensive than your typical pair of underwear because of their <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/innovation">patented absorption technology</a>. You will also need a few pairs depending on the length and flow of your period and how often you’re able to wash and dry them. Like the cups though, when you tally the cost of underwear against lifetime tampon expenses, they’re a smart economic choice.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-eco-friendly-period-products/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-4-889x592.jpg" alt="cotton tampons on pink background" class="wp-image-2219152" /></p>
<p><h2>The horrors of tampons and better options</h2>
</p>
<p>“The average American woman uses 16,800 tampons in her lifetime — or up to 24,360 if she&#8217;s on estrogen replacement therapy,” said Dr. Mercola. That’s a lot of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/waste">trash</a>, but it is also a lot of time that your body is exposed to toxic chemicals.</p>
<p><h3>Cotton is better; organic cotton is best</h3>
</p>
<p>You may have heard health experts say that cotton underwear is best for promoting vaginal health — the same goes for tampons. Look for brands that specifically say they are made from <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/organic">organic</a> cotton, but assume that most conventional brands are now made from plastics and synthetic materials. These materials are not breathable, can get fragmented and left behind and might encourage health problems like yeast and bacterial growth. Most tampons are also bleached with substances linked to abnormal tissue growth, abnormal cell growth and immune system suppression.</p>
<p>Americans use 7 billion tampon applicators every year; the chemicals in the applicator, phthalates, have been generally <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://time.com/4422774/tampons-toxic-cancer/">linked</a> to organ damage, lower I.Q. and asthma.</p>
<p><h3>What to try instead</h3>
</p>
<p>Using tampons without applicators will significantly cut down the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a> waste you generate. Brands like o.b. offer tampons that can be inserted with just your finger. Seventh Generation offers a chlorine-free, organic cotton tampon that reduces your exposure to chemicals. Organyc also offers a 100 percent organic cotton tampon.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-eco-friendly-period-products/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/sustainable-period-5-889x592.jpg" alt="floral reusable pads hanging on a line" class="wp-image-2219153" /></p>
<p><h2>What about pads?</h2>
</p>
<p>Many people prefer pads for comfort or cultural reasons; however, the average sanitary pad contains “the equivalent of about four plastic bags, and this doesn’t include the other chemicals like <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/bpa">BPA</a>, BPS, phthalates and toxic dioxin created by the bleaching process.”</p>
<p>Even though they have plastic in them, pads are never recyclable because they have been contaminated with bodily fluid. Because pads have a bigger volume than tampons, they produce even more waste. The average person throws away between 250 and 300 pounds of pads or tampons in their lifetime.</p>
<p><h3>What to use if you prefer pads</h3>
</p>
<p>There are reusable sanitary pads online that significantly reduce the amount of trash produced. Simply place the pad in your underwear; when it is dirty, rinse it with cold water and then add it to the laundry. You can buy reusable pads from Gladrags or find cute designs via Etsy. You can also try your hand at <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/diy">sewing your own</a>.</p>
<p>Disposable tampons and pads dominate the menstrual care market, but it doesn’t have to be that way. With small personal changes, you can protect your health, wallet and the planet.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delivering a modern twist to local historic building practices, London-based architectural practice <a href="http://www.b-de-c.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Bureau de Change (opens in a new tab)">Bureau de Change</a> has recently completed a new home that takes inspiration from traditional farm structures in the Cotswolds, a rural area of south central England. A pair of timber chicken sheds, nearly 100 feet long each, was used as the starting point of the design for the Long House. In addition to respecting the local rural vernacular, the thoughtfully crafted home also follows passive house principles to reduce energy use without sacrificing comfort year-round.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/contemporary-barn-inspired-home-adheres-to-passive-house-principles/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Long-House-by-Bureau-de-Change-Architects-3-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Long-House-by-Bureau-de-Change-Architects-4-889x686.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2217310" /></p>
<p>Located near Cirencester in Gloucestershire, England, the Long House spans approximately 5,400 square feet across three gabled volumes that have been given two different exterior treatments. The single-story volume to the front is built from stone, while the volume in the rear—split into two parts—is sheathed in natural larch that will gain a natural <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/patina" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="patina (opens in a new tab)">patina</a> over time. The contrast adds visual richness and the materials selected will naturally develop a patina over time to blend the buildings into the surroundings.</p>

<p>“The front barn has been built in dry stone wall by a local craftsman, chosen not only for its local relevance but for its inherent qualities of mass and muscularity,” explains Bureau de Change Architects co-founder Katerina Dionysopoulou. “This facade is monolithic, with fewer openings to produce a heavier, solid volume at the front. As a counterpoint, the taller barn in the back is clad in lighter-weight natural <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="larch (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/larch" target="_blank">larch</a> which has been charred to a deep leathery black at each window recess. This charring has then been brushed away to gently blend it into the natural larch—creating an ombre effect which emphasizes the rhythmic push and pull of the window indentations.”</p>

<p>Inside, the front volume hides an inner courtyard that’s hidden behind the elevation and serves as a light-filled focal point for the home. To meet <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/passive-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="passive house principles (opens in a new tab)">passive house principles</a>, the architects constructed the building with an insulated concrete formwork system to create an airtight thermal envelope. Openings are limited on the south-facing facade and triple-pane glass was installed to minimize unwanted heat gain and loss. Air quality is maintained with a heat recovery ventilation system.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local architecture practice <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.benjaminfleury.com" target="_blank">Benjamin Fleury</a> has completed a residential complex with 26 affordable apartments in Montreuil, a commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris. Affordable housing cooperative COOPIMMO commissioned the design and construction of the building as part of its mission to produce social accommodations with a “renting-purchasing system.” Thoughtfully integrated into the suburban context, the contemporary apartment complex also boasts low-energy consumption and has earned the MINERGIE-P label for its energy-efficient features.</p>

<p>Located on the Rue des Chantereines, the 26 Apartments in Montreuil is surrounded by a mix of 1960s housing blocks that range from structures that are five to 10 stories in height to smaller, standalone homes with gardens. Creating a building sensitive to these different building typologies was paramount to the design, as was injecting a contemporary morphology. As a result, the architects decided to split the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/affordable-housing">affordable housing</a> complex into two blocks: a street-facing “urban” block that sits opposite the multistory, midcentury housing blocks and a second “residential” block tucked farther back on the block. A communal garden and gathering space planted with deciduous trees occupies the space between the two buildings.</p>

<p>“These accommodations where first offered to local families who could not easily afford to be owners,” Benjamin Fleury said in a project statement. “The principle of the social ownership is simple: in addition to the regulation of low prices, families can contract a loan without pre-existing capital, and then become owners after a first step of renting. Because of the economic flimsiness of the buyers, who already have to assume their loans, it appeared essential to reduce effectively the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/low-maintenance">maintenance</a> costs of the building.”</p>

<p>In addition to reducing the cost of maintenance, the architects wanted to reduce energy costs. <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/passive-solar/">Passive solar principles</a> were followed to take advantage of natural light, ventilation and shading while heat loss and unwanted solar gain are mitigated with triple-glazed windows. Insulation is also built into the double-layered facade. A double-flow mechanical ventilation system and solar hot water heaters help reduce heating demands.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no surprise that humanity is consuming more <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-resources">natural resources</a> than the earth can replenish–– that is what experts mean when they say we are living unsustainably. But now, researchers can calculate the exact day of the year which we have surpassed the resources the earth can regenerate annually and this year that date was July 29. </p>
<p>The Global Footprint Network has been calculating what they call, &#8220;Earth Overshoot Day&#8221; since 1986.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/scientific-consensus-reaches-beyond-99-on-human-caused-climate-change/">Related: Scientific consensus reaches beyond 99% on human-caused climate change</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Earth Overshoot Day falling on July 29 means that humanity is currently using nature 1.75 times faster than our planet&#8217;s <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/ecosystems">ecosystems</a> can regenerate,&#8221; explained the Global Footprint Network. &#8220;This is akin to using 1.75 Earths.&#8221; </p>
<p>Their calculations are based on natural resources, including timber, fibers, food and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-sequestration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="carbon sequestration (opens in a new tab)">carbon sequestration</a>. Their data can also measure each country’s sustainability based on allotted resources per capita. Their findings show that some countries consume far more rapidly than others. For example, Qatar and Luxembourg were the first two countries to reach their nation’s Earth Overshoot Day. Iraq, Indonesia and Cuba were among the lowest, with their Overshoot Days not falling until December, when the year is almost over.</p>
<p>“The costs of this global ecological overspending are becoming increasingly evident in the form of&nbsp;deforestation, soil erosion, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/biodiversity">biodiversity</a> loss or the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The latter leads to climate change and more frequent extreme weather events,” said the Global Footprint Network.</p>
<p>What can we do to change this course? Well, according to the Global Footprint Network, certain actions do have a significant impact on the Overshoot Day. For example, if the world cut <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/meat">meat</a> consumption in half, our collective Overshoot Day would move 15 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have only got one Earth— this is the ultimately defining context for human existence,&#8221; said the Global <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-footprint">Footprint</a> Network. &#8220;We can&#8217;t use 1.75 without destructive consequences.”</p>

<p>Located in the city of Bellingham just north of Seattle, the House on the Cove is set at a high elevation and backs into a conifer forest. “This project is study of environment and experience,” the architects explained. “The home itself is secondary. With views to the west that are uninterrupted <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/puget-sound">Puget Sound</a>, San Juan Islands and Olympic Mountain Range, the experience exists regardless of the home.”</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/minimal-site-impact">minimizing impact on the landscape</a>, the house also boasts energy-efficient features and durable materials to meet the clients’ desire for sustainable housing. The house is heated with radiant concrete floors that double as a thermal mass to naturally cool the home on hot summer nights. Zola Windows open the house up completely on the west side and let natural breezes blow straight through. In winter, fireplace pipes are used to warm the air.</p>

<p>The main house spans an area of 2,504 square feet. The ground floor includes the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/open-plan/">open-plan</a> layout with the living room, dining area and kitchen as well as an office and a bedroom. The second floor comprises a spacious, west-facing en suite master bedroom, a third bedroom, a “Nest” refuge and a reading room. The separate 765-square-foot studio houses the garage, a west-facing metalworking space, and a studio space above the metalworking shop.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bencheghib, a 22-year-old athlete and environmental activist, has kicked off his effort to become the first person to run across America — and he’s doing it all to raise awareness about <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic-waste">plastic pollution</a>. Bencheghib’s initiative is a collaboration with his nonprofit Make a Change World and Parley for the Oceans.</p>
<p>He started out his journey last week after a ceremony that included remarks from the Assistant Secretary General of the U.N. Environment Program. He will run 20 miles a day, six days a week, for five months, stopping in 13 states including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Arizona and California.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/man-plans-to-swim-the-pacific-ocean-to-raise-awareness-for-plastic-pollution/">Related: Man plans to swim the Pacific Ocean to raise awareness for plastic pollution</a></p>
<p>“In times of such environmental concern, we’re really on a countdown,&#8221; Bencheghib said. &#8220;I really believe that no idea is crazy enough and so I think that by running 3,000 miles, it’s definitely a crazy feat, but it’s a good metaphor to showcase the severity of the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a> problem in the ocean. It is also an incredible opportunity to engage with as many communities as possible to tell them about the effects of plastic.”</p>
<p>Throughout his journey, Bencheghib will stop at schools and businesses to educate people about the plastic pollution crisis and encourage them to sign on to Parley’s pledge to take action. His advice is to avoid using plastic when possible, intercept plastic that is incorrectly heading to landfills or waterways and redesign plastic waste into recycled and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/upcycle">upcycled</a> materials. Bencheghib will be running in Adidas sneakers upcycled from ocean plastic in a marketing partnership with Parley.</p>
<p>“Sam and his brother Gary have already proven with previous initiatives that the real superpower of change lies in courage and individual action,&#8221; said Cyrill Gutsch, founder and CEO of Parley for the Oceans. &#8220;Everyone can change the world. Step by step. We need to include everyone in this conversation — fostering awareness and action to address these issues and drive solutions because they affect everyone, even those away from the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sea-level-rise">coasts</a> and major cities. This is an invitation to everyone who wants to rise up and have a role in the movement.&#8221;</p>

<p>To top it off, 5% of all swimwear sales are donated to the Marine Conservation Society in the UK. The nautical-themed trunks are available in eight different colors with a cost of €88 ($99) each and are meant to last longer than other similar products, promoting less waste.</p>

<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://seaqual.org/" target="_blank">Seaqual</a> organization is based in Spain and collaborates with local fishermen and communities to remove <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/waste">waste </a>found on the ocean floor. While non-plastic materials such as aluminum or glass are sent to recycling facilities, the plastic bottles and plastic packaging is cleaned, sorted, converted into flakes and turned into polymer yarn. The netting that makes up the inner lining of the shorts are made from recycled polyester.</p>

<p>According to Bluebuck founder Pierre David, “When we discovered Seaqual and their yarns we saw an opportunity to partner up and make a real difference. By <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/design">design</a>, all our products are made to last longer, meaning less waste, but by using actual waste as our raw material we’ve taken things one step further.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the new line of swimwear, Bluebuck also offers a variety of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/eco-friendly">eco-friendly</a> menswear products made from GOTS-certified organic cotton (Global Organic Textile Standard) and produced in factories powered by <a href="https://inhabitat.com/environment/renewable-energy/">renewable energy sources</a>. The company itself is even GOTS-certified and 100% of the electricity used in their offices comes from renewable sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since all of the materials and products are made in Europe, Bluebuck’s menswear can be easily shipped and moved by road instead of planes, reducing <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-emissions">CO2 </a>by about 75% according to the website. Additionally, shipping materials are made from <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/recycle">recycled </a>paper and paper tape. The company is in the process of replacing their individual product bags with compostable bags.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of northern Europe’s largest protected areas for wildlife has recently gained a new entrance building with an unexpectedly playful facade. Designed by Stockholm-based architectural office <a href="https://www.sandellsandberg.se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="sandellsandberg (opens in a new tab)">sandellsandberg</a>, the modern structure, dubbed Outdoor Eriksberg, is the first of many new buildings planned for Eriksberg Hotel &amp; Nature Reserve in southeastern Sweden’s Blekinge County. As a blend of contemporary and traditional influences, the entrance building references the traditional architecture of Blekinge with its barn-inspired shape and “Falu copper red” paint, while its curtain-like facade creates a decidedly modern vibe.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/a-scandinavian-nature-resource-gains-a-playful-and-modern-barn-shaped-building/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Outdoor-Eriksberg-by-sandellsandberg-1-889x308.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Outdoor-Eriksberg-by-sandellsandberg-2-889x588.jpg" alt="red barn inspired building surrounded by large green trees" class="wp-image-2219055" /></p>
<p>Nicknamed the “Scandinavian safari,” the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Eriksberg Nature Reserve (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eriksberg.se/" target="_blank">Eriksberg Nature Reserve</a> is home to a wide variety of animals—including red deer, fallow deer, European bison, wild boar and mouflon— that roam the grounds spanning nine square kilometers. In recent years, the nature reserve has undergone further development to accommodate its growing number of visitors that average around 50,000 people every year. Currently, the estate includes a restaurant, hotel and event spaces. </p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/a-scandinavian-nature-resource-gains-a-playful-and-modern-barn-shaped-building/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Outdoor-Eriksberg-by-sandellsandberg-1-889x308.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Outdoor-Eriksberg-by-sandellsandberg-6-889x644.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2219059" /></p>

<p>Although sandellsandberg was tapped to bring modern buildings to the nature reserve, the Swedish architecture firm didn’t shy away from taking inspiration from local traditional forms. The entrance building is reminiscent of the region’s traditional longhouses with its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="barn-shaped (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/barn" target="_blank">barn-shaped</a> form, large windows and thatched roof. However, the two-story barn-shaped building’s contemporary feel comes through in its asymmetrical roof line that’s topped with a long and large skylight that allows the interior to become illuminated with natural light, while the curtain-like facade gives the building a cartoonish appearance.</p>

<p>“Previously there was no distinct entrance to the nature reserve, which at times made visitors turn at the gates in confusion,” say the architects in their project statement. “Hence, the biggest challenges were to strengthen the site’s identity and give presumptive visitors a welcoming first impression of the reserve. These needs gave birth to the idea of a textile look where an unexpected curtain-shaped façade surprises and welcomes the visitor and like a curtain open up to the nature reserve.”</p>

<p>Spanning an area of 600 square meters, the entrance building is a multipurpose space that not only welcomes guests to the Eriksberg Nature Reserve, but also hosts events space, office areas, storage, as well as retail and restaurant space. The ground floor houses a series of back <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="offices (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/office/" target="_blank">offices</a>, a cafe and a shop that sells homegrown produce.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BEG House by Rudolphy + Bizama Arquitectos is located off of Lake Riñihue in the Los Ríos Region of Chile. With stunning views of the lake and the Andes Mountains to the south, the designers made sure to prioritize these vistas from each of the main spaces.

<p>To provide even more light and ventilation, there are several interior courtyards built into the home as well. The region is known for rain, so the windows and glass doors separating the interior to the courtyards give one the feeling of being outside and enjoying the cool rain while staying comfortable and dry inside. These <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/courtyard">courtyards</a> also allow for the merging of the property with the surrounding natural spaces for the home and the environment to work as one.</p>

<p>The dark color of the exterior of the house, constructed of pre-painted metal sheets, helps the structure blend into the environment with thoughtful pops of brightly-colored wood used as a slight contrast. The metal brings the walls and the roof together, and the slopes of the roof on the interior are built at different heights to mimic nature.</p>

<p>The natural, organic shades of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/wood">wood</a> on the interior gives the residents even more connection to the setting while contrasting beautifully with the dark metal exterior. With the exception of the kitchen, the entire inside is unpainted to show off the light wood. The abundance of rain also nourishes the dense, rainforest shrubbery that surrounds the property, creating plenty of greenery to complement the lake views and make this home truly unique.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Ambikapur in India’s Chhattisgarh state is launching a “garbage cafe” where anyone can eat healthy meals in exchange for collecting trash. The cafe will be centrally located in the city’s busiest bus terminal and is owned by the Municipal Corporation. Although such cafes exist in other cities around the world, the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic-waste">plastic trash</a> collected for Ambikapur’s cafe is unique, because it will go directly into asphalt to pave the city&#8217;s roads.</p>
<p>The practice of melting plastic and incorporating it into paving materials is not new in India. In fact, the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/world/macrebur-plastic-roads/index.html">government mandated</a> that all urban areas utilize plastic waste in their roads in 2015, but most have yet to follow orders. The city of Ambikapur has one such road so far, and there are an estimated 100,000 kilometers of plastic roads throughout <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/india">India</a>.</p>
<p>The innovative chemical process is led by professor Rajagopalan Vasudevan, but it has also been replicated and modified by engineers around the world, including the plastic-producing giant <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dow-chemical-recycled-plastic-streets-2019-2">Dow Chemical</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a> is a great product. It lasts for long, which is a problem if it&#8217;s a waste product, but not a problem if we want it to last,&#8221; said engineer Toby McCartney, whose company produces recycled plastic pellets that are mixed into roads.</p>
<p>According to McCartney, plastic roads last three times longer than conventional roads and need less maintenance. They are more resistant to flooding and less likely to get potholes.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whitefish, Montana is known for its spectacular natural scenery, and now a family of four has a beautiful new home that reflects the region. Using an existing barn as inspiration, <a href="https://www.ctagroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CTA Group</a> designed the Railway Residence, an impressive, 3,500-square-foot <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/energy-efficiency">energy-efficient</a> home, to frame the surrounding views from virtually any angle.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/energy-efficient-home-in-whitefish-was-inspired-by-the-regions-agrarian-vernacular/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Exterior_2-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2217262" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Exterior_4-889x592.jpg" alt="wood home with gabled roofs"></p>
<p>Tucked into an idyllic landscape of 4.5 acres in the eastern outskirts of Whitefish, Montana, the Railway Residence is surrounded by the mountain ranges to the north and east, connected by the historic Great Northern Railroad, which was inspiration for the home&#8217;s name. This amazing, natural setting set the tone for the design, both in its aesthetic and its energy performance.</p>

<p>From a distance, the barn-like <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/gable">gabled roof</a> and extension pay homage to the agrarian vernacular architecture found throughout the region. But the traditional volume conceals a savvy blend of contemporary features that create a soothing, sophisticated home with an impressive number of energy-efficient features.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/energy-efficient-home-in-whitefish-was-inspired-by-the-regions-agrarian-vernacular/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Exterior_2-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2217259" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Exterior_1-889x592.jpg" alt="wood home with concrete patio"></p>
<p>Clad in light-hued cedar siding, the wooden exterior is a nod to the wooded areas that surround the home. This pleasing envelope contains a strategic, energy-saving profile including ultra tight insulation that provides a 50 percent improvement over code minimums. Additionally, the use of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/prefab">prefabricated wood</a> trusses allowed the structure to be sealed and insulated as well as naturally ventilated. Adding to the tight thermal envelope, the home was also installed with an abundance of high performance glass doors and triple-pane windows.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/interior-design/">interior spaces</a> are divided into four spaces arranged around a central glass walkway. The social areas, including a spacious living area, home office and music studio along with a garage and storage, are located on one side, while the private sleeping areas are on the other.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/energy-efficient-home-in-whitefish-was-inspired-by-the-regions-agrarian-vernacular/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Exterior_2-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2217268" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Interior_3-889x578.jpg" alt="an interior living space with dining table and large windows"></p>
<p>The interior design, comprised of no-fuss, sophisticated furnishings, was meant to put the focus on creating a comfortable, bright living space where the family could enjoy the incredible views from anywhere in the home.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/energy-efficient-home-in-whitefish-was-inspired-by-the-regions-agrarian-vernacular/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Exterior_2-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2217265" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/1Railway-Residence_Interior_4-889x592.jpg" alt="kitchen space with wooden cabinets and concrete flooring"></p>
<p>The concrete flooring was installed with <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/radiant-floor-heating">radiant in-floor heating</a> that’s paired with a heat recovery ventilator to significantly reduce energy usage, especially in the chilly Montana winters.</p>

<p>Bright windows placed underneath the many roof eaves allow <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-light/">natural light</a> inside while the eaves provide shade from solar gain in the hot summer months.

			<description>Just when you thought the environmental news couldn’t get any worse, a shocking new report warns Americans that they may be facing temperatures of 127 degrees Fahrenheit. By the year 2100, more than one-third of the U.S. population could be exposed to this kind of heat and its accompanying health risks.[...]</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when you thought the environmental news couldn’t get any worse, a shocking new report warns Americans that they may be facing temperatures of 127 degrees Fahrenheit. By the year 2100, more than one-third of the U.S. population could be exposed to this kind of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/global-warming">heat</a> and its accompanying health risks.</p>
<p>The county-by-county survey predicts that by mid-century, more than 250 American cities will suffer from at least one month of days where the heat index surpasses 100 degrees. Historically, this number has been 29 cities. The heat-index scale combines temperature with humidity to arrive at what the temperature feels like. </p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/extreme-heat-wallops-us/">Related: Extreme heat wallops the US</a></p>
<p>“We were very surprised at how steeply and quickly the number of days of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/heat-wave">dangerous heat</a> increased in such a short time,” said Kristina Dahl, senior climate scientist at Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Dahl co-authored the dire new report, “<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/killer-heat-in-united-states" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Killer Heat in the United States: Climate Choices and the Future of Dangerously Hot Days</a>.”</p>
<p>Extreme heat will hit the Southeast and Southern Great Plains the hardest. Texas and southern Arizona will also be sweltering. But even temperate areas, such as Seattle, will notice <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">a significant increase</a> in hot days.</p>
<p>Humans, with a normal internal temperature of 98.6, function poorly in extreme heat. Climate researcher Tom Crowther said the increase in heat events “represents a terrifying prospect” and “a direct and immediate threat to human <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/health">health</a> and wellbeing.” </p>
<p>Droughts, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/flooding">floods</a> and wildfires will accompany the extreme temperatures. Sea level rise and compromised food production will also make life tougher.</p>
<p>Humankind’s best hope? A fast and drastic reduction in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-emissions">carbon emissions</a>. “Our past <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate">climate</a> can no longer guide us,&#8221; said meteorologist Richard Rood. &#8220;We have to build and adapt to what’s coming.”</p>

<p><h3>Studies Say</h3>
</p>
<p>Many of us remember the infamous <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html" target="_blank">2006 study</a> revealing that livestock and meat production are generating more <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/greenhouse-gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a> than transport. The report, released by the United Nations Food and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/agriculture">Agriculture </a>Organization (FAO), was enough to make any carnivore rethink their meat consumption. At the time, Henning Steinfeld, Chief of FAO’s Livestock Information and Policy Branch and author of the report said, “Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today’s most serious environmental problems. Urgent action is required to remedy the situation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/impossible-foods-tests-a-fish-less-fish-protein/">Related: Impossible Foods tests a fish-less fish protein </a></p>
<p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, released a statement classifying processed meat as a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carcinogen">carcinogen</a> <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/world-health-organization-says-processed-meat-causes-cancer.html" target="_blank">in 2015</a>. It also classified red meat as a probable carcinogen. It took a total of 22 experts from 10 countries and the review of over 800 studies to reach this conclusion. They found that consuming 50 grams of processed meat each day (the equivalent of about four strips of bacon or one hot dog) could increase the risk of colorectal cancer by 18%. When it came to red meat, the report found evidence of increased risk of colorectal, pancreatic and prostate cancers.</p>
<p><h3>The Big Bucks</h3>
</p>
<p>More and more people are making the switch to a plant-based diet, whether for the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environmet">environment</a>, personal health or love of animals. As the vegan and vegetarian lifestyles rise in numbers, corporations are taking notice and forming strategies to take livestock out of the equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plant-based meat market is already booming. According to the Good Food Institute, the sale of plant-based meat grew 10% from April 2018 to April 2019 and 37% over the past two years. Last year 11.9% of all U.S. households purchased <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plants">plant-based</a> meat, which may not sound like much, but that equates to about 15 million households. Plant-based food is currently a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch" target="_blank">$4.5 billion industry</a> and has grown 31% in the past two years.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/beyond-impossible-alternative-meats-are-they-actually-healthier-than-the-real-thing/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/LEADiuyj0xc97f2ftibwbeop-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/ctpms41nt8erqrshiear-889x592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2218231" /></p>
<p><h3>Beyond and Impossible</h3>
</p>
<p>The question of whether these plant-based meats are actually good for your health, however, still has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/03/are-beyond-meats-burgers-healthier-than-red-meat-dietitians-say-no.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">experts debating</a>. Unsurprisingly, the futuristic vegan burgers of two most popular plant-based meat companies in the nation have found themselves under the spotlight.</p>
<p>By 2016, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/" target="_blank">Beyond Meat</a> released the first plant-based burger sold in grocery stores (such as Whole Foods) internationally. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://impossiblefoods.com/" target="_blank">Impossible Foods</a> began selling their plant-based “bleeding” burgers to fast-food brands and gourmet spots such as Bareburger and Umami Burger in 2017.</p>
<p>The controversy first began in 2018 when the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-26/why-the-bloody-impossible-burger-faces-another-fda-hurdle" target="_blank">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> expressed concern over soy leghemoglobin or “heme,” which is an essential ingredient in the Impossible Foods burger “meat.” The key ingredient creates the illusion of blood and aroma of real meat, and the company found a way to harvest it from plants creating a protein produced by genetically modified yeast cells. Soy is also a key ingredient in popular veggie meat patty brands, Morningstar Farms Garden Veggie Burgers and Kraft Heinz’s Boca Veggie Burgers. Beyond Meat uses beets for color and pea protein isolate, which is processed and is not considered a whole <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/food">food.</a></p>

<p><h3>The Ingredients</h3>
</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/products/the-beyond-burger/" target="_blank">Beyond</a>: Water, Pea Protein Isolate, Expeller-Pressed Canola Oil, Refined Coconut Oil, Rice Protein, Natural Flavors, Cocoa Butter, Mung Bean Protein, Methylcellulose, Potato Starch, Apple Extract, Salt, Potassium Chloride, Vinegar, Lemon Juice Concentrate, Sunflower Lecithin, Pomegranate Fruit Powder, Beet Juice Extract (for color). </p>

<p><h3>Things to Consider</h3>
</p>
<p>While the protein content is similar to actual meat, the plant-based protein used to produce vegan meat is processed. <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/processed-food">Processed </a>proteins should be eaten in moderation, so more isn’t necessarily better. The process isn’t nearly as synthetic or harmful as say, a twinkie, but it is still something to consider.</p>
<p>Both burgers include coconut oil (rich in saturated fat) as a main ingredient, which the American Heart Association <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/05/01/advisory-replacing-saturated-fat-with-healthier-fat-could-lower-cardiovascular-risks" target="_blank">has risen concerns about</a>. There is a large amount of sodium in both burgers. Beyond has 390 milligrams of sodium and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/impossible-foods">Impossible </a>has 370 mg.</p>
<p>There is also the concerning fact that both Impossible and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/beyond-meat">Beyond </a>have yet to reveal <em>how </em>exactly their burgers are made. The companies consider production methods to be trade secrets, which is understandable in a business sense, but far more complicated than the cow = meat process we’ve all grown up with.</p>
<p>When compared to <a href="https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/ground-beef-(80%25-lean---20%25-fat)?portionid=41309&amp;portionamount=4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a 4-ounce beef burger</a> with 20 percent fat content, both Beyond and Impossible burgers have fewer calories, fewer grams of fat and the same amount of (or slightly more) protein. Both plant-based burgers have no cholesterol and more fiber than a regular beef burger.</p>
<p>So, are these plant-based burgers actually healthier than the real thing? Well, it depends on the individual. High risk for colorectal cancer? Need to lay off the saturated fats or sodium? Your lifestyle, diet and personal <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/health">health </a>all need to be considered when making the switch to plant-based meats— and that’s between you and your doctor.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rhode Island School of Design student Hyunseok An has created a prototype indoor micro-algae farm in a bid to sustainably and beautifully integrate algae into our everyday lives. Dubbed The Coral after its coral pattern, the micro-farm takes on the shape of a four-by-four gridded bioreactor that can be mounted on the wall like artwork. The <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/algae/">algae</a> that grows inside each square component is rendered visible through transparent containers so that owners can watch as the algae grows and changes color.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/risd-student-designs-a-micro-algae-farm-for-home-use/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/The-Coral-by-Hyunseok-An-4-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/The-Coral-by-Hyunseok-An-1-889x592.jpg" alt="person attaching green square to a grid" class="wp-image-2218468" /></p>
<p>In 1974, the U.N. World Food Conference declared algae “the most ideal food for mankind” for its rich nutritional makeup; however, popular opinion often dismisses the superfood as nothing more than pond scum. Hyunseok An, who is pursuing a master&#8217;s degree in industrial design at <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/risd/">RISD</a>, wants to change our perception of algae and promote its health and environmental benefits. Algae, which grows quickly with few inputs, is also lauded for its ability to sequester carbon at an absorption rate that’s estimated to be 10 times greater than typical plants.</p>

<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/risd-student-designs-a-micro-algae-farm-for-home-use/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/The-Coral-by-Hyunseok-An-4-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/The-Coral-by-Hyunseok-An-3-889x687.jpg" alt="person pouring green liquid into a dish" class="wp-image-2218470" /></p>
<p>The Coral comprises 16 cells arranged in a grid pattern with two grams of algae in each culture cell — the recommended daily intake amount. Each cell replenishes its stock on a biweekly cycle so that users will always have access to the sustainable food. As the algae grows and replenishes its stock, the cell changes color from clear to varying shades of green. The <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/coral/">coral</a> pattern printed on the transparent cells symbolizes the reversal of “coral bleaching,” a global phenomenon where coral is irritated — the causes can be varied from sea temperature fluctuations or <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pollution">pollution</a> — and expels algae, thus turning the coral completely white. </p>

<p>“Through its use and indoor experience, The Coral aims to change the preconception of algae, suggesting a socially acceptable way of reconnecting with algae and bringing it into our everyday lives,” Hyunseok An explained in a project statement. “By doing so, The Coral can help us take one step forward to a better, more sustainable way of living for us and for our world.”</p>

			<description>Toyota has announced that the official testing of its solar-powered Prius will begin in late July 2019. Trials set to take place in the Tokyo area will test the cruising range and fuel efficiency of the car model, which has been equipped with high-efficiency solar panels.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toyota has announced that the official testing of its <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/28787347.html" target="_blank">solar-powered Prius</a> will begin in late July 2019.

<p>The demo car produced for public road trials will include a solar battery panel created by Sharp and developed for a NEDO-led project. Thanks to the thin design of the efficient panels, Toyota was able to install them on the roof, hood and rear hatch door of the new model to enhance the efficiency. The new and improved utilization of these panels means that the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/cars">car</a> will be able to achieve a conversion efficiency of over 34 percent and capable of delivering an impressive 860 watts of power.</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious environmental advantages of using <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-car/">solar power in cars</a>, the supercharged Prius can also provide consumers with an improved range. According to a study conducted by Volvo, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/26637/americans-cite-range-anxiety-cost-as-largest-barriers-for-new-ev-purchases-study" target="_blank">65 percent of electric vehicle</a> drivers experienced “range anxiety” after purchasing an <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/ev">EV</a>, making it one of the leading reasons why potential electric vehicle buyers hesitate on buying one. The anxiety is understandable — what if you run out of power in the middle of nowhere with no charging station in sight? The application of solar-powered cars has the potential to lessen those worries, as this Toyota Prius demo model aims to charge both while parked and while being driven.</p>

<p>Toyota will evaluate the test runs on the number of times the car needs charged and the reduction of carbon emissions and share results with NEDO and Sharp as the collaborative group continues to work toward improving the sustainability of transportation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next Summer, the top athletes in the world will compete in the Tokyo Olympics and those who come out on top will receive the ancient game’s first 100 percent recycled medals. The gold, silver and bronze medals will all be made from metals recycled directly from old cell phones, computers and other <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/electronic-waste" target="_blank">electronic waste</a>.</p>
<p>The Olympic Committee selected Japanese artist Junichi Kawanishi’s design out of over 400 entries. They then spent the next two years collecting almost <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708209/tokyo-2020-olympic-medals-phone-metals">79,000</a> tons of gadgets, including more than 6 million cellphones. Their “Everyone’s Medal” collection campaign gave ordinary people the opportunity to feel proud that their old phones would be reborn as Olympic medals.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never dreamed that the design I submitted, only as a memorial to this lifetime event, would be actually selected,&#8221; said designer Kawanishi. &#8220;With their shining rings, I hope the medals will be seen as paying tribute to the athletes&#8217; efforts, reflecting their glory and symbolizing friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olympic medals have not been made of <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://www.thepostgame.com/blog/list/201207/most-valuable-olympic-gold-medals">solid gold</a> since the Stockholm games in 1912, but Olympic regulations do dictate the minimum quantity of each precious medal. The Tokyo medals will feature six grams of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/gold">gold </a>plating with a silver interior. The silver medal is indeed pure silver and the bronze is a blend of copper and zinc.</p>
<p>Regulations also mandate <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708209/tokyo-2020-olympic-medals-phone-metals">standard design</a> features: the Olympic rings, the Greek goddess <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/nike">Nike </a>and Panatheniac stadium, and the official name of the games.</p>
<p>Brazil led the way in 2016 with mercury-free gold medals, but <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/tokyo">Tokyo’s </a>design is an unprecedented emblem of sustainability both around the world and within the Olympic games and village.</p>
<p>Over 5,000 medals will be produced and used for both the Olympics and the Paraolympics.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>São Paolo-based firm <a href="https://steckarquitetura.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Steck Arquitetura</a> has just unveiled the Julieta House, a concrete home that spans nearly 7,000 square feet. Located in the city of Piracicaba, the house is comprised of a concrete shell that provides a strong thermal envelope along with a bevy of sustainable features such as <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-power/">solar power</a> to help the home reduce its energy needs to a bare minimum.</p>

<p>Surrounded by a low-lying <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/concrete/">concrete wall,</a> the three-story home is located on a sloped lot that creates extra space for its large volume. The partially-embedded ground floor houses the garage, storage space and maintenance equipment.</p>

<p>The main living area is located on the first floor, where high ceilings with sunken spaces add a sense of whimsy to the atmosphere. The main social areas, along with the private bedrooms, all boast a modern, minimalist design. Sparse furnishings bring out the warm palette of wood and concrete that is further enhanced by an abundance of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-light/">natural light</a>.</p>

<p>At the heart of the home is the massive <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/swimming-pool/">swimming pool</a>. Thanks to a few savvy design techniques, the indoor area and outdoor area have a seamless connection. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors slide completely open to create one large, open-air living space, which includes easy access to the pool.</p>

<p>Concrete features prominently throughout the design. From the exterior envelope to the concrete roofs that have several shade-providing overhangs, the raw concrete surfaces throughout the home create an interesting juxtaposition with the Mediterranean-style layout.</p>

<p>In addition to the tight thermal envelope, the home also boasts a number of sustainable features. A <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/green-roof">green roof</a> shares space with a solar array hooked up to meet the home&#8217;s energy needs, including the solar-powered water heater. Additionally, using the wet Brazilian climate to its advantage, the home was installed with a rainwater catchment system that is used to irrigate the gardens.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dunkin’ is stretching beyond its donut origins as it introduces a new Beyond Meat breakfast sandwich. The chain restaurant rolled out the new $4.29 menu item at 163 Manhattan locations Wednesday, with plans for national availability in the future. Beyond Meat is producing the sausage exclusively for Dunkin’.</p>
<p>But before <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plant-based">plant-based</a> customers get too excited, note that while the sausage itself is vegan, the sandwich is not. The patty is topped with American cheese and egg. Dunkin&#8217; CEO Dave Hoffman told CNN Business a fully vegan sandwich might be in the future. &#8220;Right now we&#8217;re targeting <a href="https://inhabitat.com/is-a-flexitarianism-diet-right-for-you/">flexitarians</a>,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/dunkin-donuts-unveils-a-tiny-home-powered-by-recycled-coffee-grounds/">Related: Dunkin&#8217; unveils a tiny home powered by recycled coffee grounds</a></p>
<p>Dunkin’s new sandwich is part of a trend of mainstream restaurants luring omnivores with meat substitutes as more studies indicate decreasing meat consumption is better for healthy bodies and a healthy planet. Sales of plant-based foods are up 11 percent in the U.S. this year, according to Plant Based Foods Association and the Good Food Institute. Financial giant Barclays predicts the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/alternative-protein">alternative meat</a> sector could account for 10 percent of global meat sales in the next 10 years, reaching $140 billion.</p>
<p>Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are the two plant-based darlings of the fast food scene, as both create faux meat to be as much like the real thing as possible. Many restaurant chains have partnered with these companies over the last two years, including <a href="https://inhabitat.com/little-caesars-debuts-vegan-sausage/">Little Caesars</a>, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/burger-king-unveils-the-plant-based-impossible-whopper/">Burger King</a> and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/white-castle-is-now-offering-bleeding-vegan-impossible-burger-sliders/">White Castle</a>.</p>
<p>The sudden demand has strained Beyond Meat’s supplies, making the company struggle to expand quickly. “We were surprised in the interest consumers were showing in our products and that it turned on very quickly,” CEO Ethan Brown said. Investors have been quick to embrace the new faux sausage sandwich, pushing the stock value of both Beyond Meat and Dunkin’.</p>

The crew members take turns playing auctioneer, spinning wildly exaggerated tales of the attributes of lighthouse-shaped magnets, a maple syrup cookbook and a bottle of whiskey. Passengers get into a bidding war over a maple leaf mug, with a winning price of $60. The One Ocean Expeditions&#8217; flag that’s been flying on the ship goes for over $200. It’s a silly and fun event that raises almost $1,200 for the cruise line’s favorite ocean-related charities, including the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, Scott Polar Research Institute and the penguin-tracking Oceanites. Over the past eight years, One Ocean’s passengers have contributed nearly half a million dollars toward <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/conservation">conservation</a> groups.</p>

<p>This is just one way that the small, British Columbia-headquartered company balances business with social and environmental responsibility. As stated in One Ocean Expeditions&#8217; philosophy on its website, “We view the world as one large <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/ocean">ocean</a> containing a series of large islands. So, it stands to reason that our actions in one part of the ocean will trickle down and have an effect in another part.” The company strives to give guests a fun and memorable travel experience while being a model of ecological sensitivity.</p>

<p><h2>Respectful port visits</h2>
</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/" target="_blank">One Ocean Expeditions</a> gives a lot of thought to partnering with its destinations, whether visiting wilderness or developed communities. Since the company began with polar expeditions, biosecurity has always been extremely important. To be sure that passengers aren’t bringing seeds and other contaminants ashore, guests must check their zippers and Velcro for debris and scrape out the treads of their shoes. Passengers line up to vacuum backpack pockets and closures on jackets. Everyone must also dip the soles of their shoes in a special chemical bath before visiting certain ports.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/meet-maya-kaan-mexicos-newest-ecotourism-destination/">Related: Meet Maya Ka’an — Mexico’s newest ecotourism destination</a></p>
<p>On the Fins and Fiddles cruise of eastern <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/canada">Canada</a>, the only stop that requires biosecurity measures is Sable Island. This long, narrow island southeast of Nova Scotia is famous for its wild horses and enormous gray seal colony. Bird life is also abundant. Ipswich sparrows nest here, and roseate terns will let you know you’re getting too close to their quarters by dive-bombing your head.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/small-cruise-line-treats-the-whole-world-as-one-ocean/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/one-ocean-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Inhab_Sable-Island-horses-e1563818792944.jpg" alt="island horses grazing" class="wp-image-2218073" /></p>
<p>“In Canada, Sable Island is really special to a lot of people,” Alannah Phillips, park manager of <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ns/sable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sable Island National Park Reserve</a>, told Inhabitat. “It has kind of a magic and mystery to it that people want to make sure it’s protected.” Only about 450 people per year manage to visit this remote island. Visiting requires special permits, and nobody but Parks Canada staff and a few qualified researchers are allowed to spend the night ashore. One Ocean Expeditions is one of the few small <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/cruise">cruise</a> lines to obtain a permit.</p>
<p>The boot wash is the most important part of biosecurity, Phillips said, because the chemicals kill diseases that could be transported from horse farms. “You get a lot of horse people who want to go to Sable Island.”</p>
<p>This is one of the most as-is beaches people will ever see. Seal skulls, shark vertebrae, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastics</a> — all sorts of things litter the beach. What looks like kelp turns out to be long, unraveled seal intestines. “It’s an amazing platform to teach people,” Phillips said. “Even though it’s 175 kilometers from the mainland in middle of the Atlantic Ocean, what you drop in the water wherever you are can end up on Sable Island.” Helium balloons, coconuts and sneakers regularly wash up. The most exciting find Phillips remembers was a message in a bottle dropped from a Scottish ocean liner in the 1930s. </p>
<p>Other Canadian stops feature low-impact activities, such as biking the Confederation Trail on Prince Edward Island, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/hiking">hiking</a> in Highlands National Park on Cape Breton Island and taking a guided history walk of the ghost town island Ile aux Marins off Saint Pierre and Miquelon. A fleet of kayaks and stand-up paddle boards offer other planet-healthy options.</p>

<p><h2>Sustainable cruising</h2>
</p>
<p>One Ocean Expeditions is a tiny cruise line. At the moment, it’s only running one ship, the 146-passenger RCGS Resolute, which burns marine gas oil, a cleaner alternative than the cheaper heavy fuel oil. The ship avoids traveling at full speed, preferring a leisurely pace that reduces <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/emissions">emissions</a> while interfering less with the navigation and communication of marine animals.</p>
<p>Cabin bathrooms feature fragrant <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/biodegradable">biodegradable</a> soap, shampoo and conditioner in refillable dispensers, made by an ethical producer on Salt Spring Island, Canada. Every guest gets a reusable water bottle. This is convenient, as there’s a water bottle filling station on every deck. Announcements over the loudspeaker remind passengers to bring their water bottles on expeditions, and One Ocean hauls a huge water dispenser ashore in case bottles run dry. Even the on-board gym offers a water dispenser but no cups. If you forget your water bottle, well, consider walking back to your cabin to retrieve it as part of your workout.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/small-cruise-line-treats-the-whole-world-as-one-ocean/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/one-ocean-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Inhab_historic-walking-tour-on-Sailors-Island-889x803.jpg" alt="gable buildings of a ghost town" class="wp-image-2218070" /></p>
<p>One Oceans Expeditions has taken the #BePlasticWise pledge and is part of the United Nations Environment Programme’s “Clean Seas” working group, which aims to drastically reduce the consumption of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/single-use">single-use plastic</a>. The cruise line regularly hosts scientists who do on-board research ranging from collecting meteorological data to tagging and tracking migrant whale populations to measuring plastic pollution in sea water.</p>
<p> “OOE also takes part annually in the ‘Clean-up Svalbard’ program to protect the fragile ecosystem of the Norwegian Arctic,” according to Victoria Dowdeswell, part of One Ocean’s marketing and business development team. “Here, both staff and guests collect rubbish and assorted debris from fishing vessels, which are carried via the Gulf Stream to Svalbard’s shores each year. OOE know that there is only one ocean and that we all need to work to protect it.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, the United Nations General Assembly recognized access to clean water as a human right. To raise awareness about the “questionable privatizations” and climate change threatening this human right, Spanish design collective <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/luzinterruptus/">Luzinterruptus</a> created ‘Let’s Go Fetch Water!’, a temporary art installation made from recycled plastic. Located on the grounds of the Spanish Embassy and the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington, D.C., the art installation features an eye-catching waterfall effect created by a series of angled buckets cascading water sourced from a closed-loop system.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/recycled-plastic-art-installation-asserts-that-water-is-a-human-right-in-d-c/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Let’s-Go-Fetch-Water-by-Luzinterruptus-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Let’s-Go-Fetch-Water-by-Luzinterruptus-3-889x592.jpg" alt="blue art installation in city" class="wp-image-2217838" /></p>
<p>When designing Let’s Go Fetch Water!, Luzinterruptus wanted to reference the daily toils that many people — mostly women — around the world must go through to fetch <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/water">water</a> for their family’s basic supply. As a result, buckets that are used to draw and transport water became the main motif for the piece. “These buckets transport this precious liquid from fountains and wells and are even hoisted down to the depths of the Earth in order to get it,” the designers explained. “They later carry them through long perilous trails during grueling journeys, where not even a drop must be spilled.”</p>

<p>To minimize the loss of water, Luzinterruptus used a slow-flowing current and closed-loop system for the waterfall effect. The designers were also adamant about using buckets made from <a href="https://inhabitat.com/innovation/recycled-materials/">recycled materials</a> rather than take the easy route of purchasing cheap buckets made in China. The buckets were mounted onto a wooden frame, and all of the materials will be recycled after the installation is dismantled in September. The installation is on display from May 16 to September 27 and will be lit up and functional at night as well.</p>

<p>“We all know water is scarce,” Luzinterruptus said. “<a href="https://inhabitat.com/climate-change">Climate change</a> is one of the main reasons; however, questionable privatizations are also to be blamed. Governments lacking financial resources give up this resource to private companies in exchange for supply infrastructures. Other governments just sell their aquifers and springs to large food and beverage corporations, which exploit these and everything around dry, leaving local inhabitants in deep crisis. We have enjoyed this particular commission since we have, for a long time, been dealing with issues concerning the recycling of plastic material, and we have experienced firsthand how these companies that sell someone else’s water, and seem to be especially focused on launching awareness campaigns for a responsible use of plastic, only try to deviate attention from this uncomfortable privatization issue.”</p>

Sustainability will also be woven into the design of the building, which will target BREEAM excellent certification and be powered with rooftop solar panels.</p>
<p>Located on the east side of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/amsterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Amsterdam (opens in a new tab)">Amsterdam</a>, Matrix 1 at Amsterdam Science Park will span 13,000 square meters. The SustainaLab will occupy a quarter of the building footprint. To open the new facility up to the existing buildings on campus, which include the six existing buildings of the Matrix Innovation Center as well as the University of Amsterdam’s Facility of Science, Mathematics and Computer Science buildings, the architects will clad a large portion of Matrix 1 in glass to ensure that the building will be “open and social.”</p>

<p>The focal point of the building will be a spacious zigzagging <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="staircase (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/staircase/" target="_blank">staircase</a> that’s fully visible from the outside. Prominently located at the entrance, the stairwell serves as the social heart of the building that stimulates interaction and “provides a balance in the building between the standardized laboratories and a playful, people-oriented architecture— an important consideration in a building where tech workers, who have high expectations for the quality of their office spaces, will share with science workers, for whom laboratories are unable to provide the same perks,” say the architects in a press release. “Matrix 1’s stairwell will thus allow scientific workers to feel pampered in the same way that has been normal in the tech sector.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have released three additional studies confirming the consensus among scientists that <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">climate change</a> is real. More than 99 percent of scientists have reached the same conclusion that global warming is real and caused by human activity, with findings showing that current warming is unprecedented when compared to the last 2,000 years.</p>
<p>Even though most deniers are political or corporate-backed — rather than driven by <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/science">science</a> — scientists continue to release worrisome research repeating and reconfirming that all evidence indicates climate change is real in hopes that the consensus itself will be convincing.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt left — as has been shown extensively in many other studies addressing many different aspects of the climate system using different methods and data sets,” said Stefan Brönnimann of the University of Bern.</p>
<p>The three studies were published in <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nature Geoscience</em> and indicate that the temperature spikes over the last few decades have not been as dramatic over the last <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0400-0.epdf?referrer_access_token=vdfNPxzPrVsR1F9NMBVPktRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0N7bTxBqLecWapiK43Tv3o5PzlP3yU4M1aQfVsGAWcU8hAbkMnJvoUiH886GbPMiVe022ISWAeoChP3Qq_Gt6jprCUM4W5-EMoYm56z1CGLQknj0EOohqgyidLWgHd7vTsA9QxQZmVSdY7eKCMbQIaUoHgIuis5f9NC33YpNXHVtNitDUFOTU71Et6rlahLu20hKIpuwbReQLDhrdZOA_gKFszcdEyBienroO5BMQtXxnk0O1gPI_PY9qHkBNIjayvCzdM4UOjFvszjUrokZWuD">2,000 years</a>.

The researchers used proxy indicators such as evidence in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/trees">trees</a>, ice and sediment, which show that changes in climate have never been as severe as they are now.</p>
<p>“The good news is public understanding of the scientific consensus is increasing,&#8221; said researcher James Cook, who wrote the original paper on scientific consensus in 2013. &#8220;The bad news is there is still a lot of work to do yet as climate deniers continue to persistently attack the scientific consensus.” Last week, the original paper was downloaded for the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://skepticalscience.com/97-consensus-study-hits-million-downloads.html">one millionth</a> time, making it the most-read study by the Institute of Physics. Cook also wrote a follow-up to this study, but because of the recent rise in disasters and interest in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate">climate change</a>, he plans to revise his paper again.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polish architectural firm <a href="http://www.toprojekt.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Biuro Toprojekt</a> has unveiled a beautiful home that showcases a brilliant brick and glass facade. The Red House is a 3,900-square-foot home clad with chiaroscuro-style walls made from <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/reclaimed-brick/">reclaimed bricks</a> on one side, while the back consists almost entirely of glass doors and windows that frame incredible views of the serene forestscape surrounding the residence.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/green-roofed-home-in-poland-is-made-out-of-reclaimed-brick/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/the-red-house-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2218012" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Red-House1-889x519.jpg" alt="brick and glass home"></p>
<p>Located in Poland’s Upper Silesia, the brick house sits on the edge of an expansive forestscape. Using the idyllic setting as inspiration, the architects decided to use as many eco-friendly and reclaimed building materials and features as possible, including a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-power/">solar array</a> that generates sufficient power to the house.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/a-beautiful-brick-home-is-embedded-into-the-brazilian-countryside/">Related: A beautiful brick home is embedded into the Brazilian countryside</a></p>

<p>At first glance, the stunning <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/brick/">brick exterior</a> catches the eye. Made out of old bricks reclaimed from a nearby brickworks, the facades were hand-laid in a chiaroscuro style, creating a vibrant, three-dimensional pattern made up of light and shadows.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/green-roofed-home-in-poland-is-made-out-of-reclaimed-brick/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/the-red-house-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2218005" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Red-House8-889x561.jpg" alt="white living room with gray furniture and one glass wall"></p>
<p>The lovely brick facade is topped with a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/green-roof/">green roof</a> planted with native vegetation, including vines, which will begin to fall over the roofline over time, further melding the structure into its natural setting.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/green-roofed-home-in-poland-is-made-out-of-reclaimed-brick/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/the-red-house-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2218006" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Red-House7-889x488.jpg" alt="large dining table with chairs"></p>
<p>The entrance is through an open cutout in the exterior wall that leads into a brick courtyard and garage. As the residents walk inside, the mood changes dramatically as the surroundings transform from a solid brick exterior to a contemporary, luminous space.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/green-roofed-home-in-poland-is-made-out-of-reclaimed-brick/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/the-red-house-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2218004" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Red-House9-889x567.jpg" alt="kitchen with large window looking out over forest"></p>
<p>Although the front facade is marked by its brilliant brick walls, the back of the home consists of entire walls made up of large, sliding glass doors and full-height windows that frame the views of the forest. White walls, along with a natural color palette and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/minimalist">minimal furnishings</a>, create a modern but comfortable atmosphere.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A leading green economy nonprofit, Green America, released a report ranking top <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="fashion (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fashion/" target="_blank">fashion</a> companies based on their sustainability and transparency. The results reveal the inadequacies of greening the fashion industry.&nbsp; Their <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.greenamerica.org/sites/default/files/2019-07/GA_TextilesReport_Final_0.pdf">study</a> investigated 14 major corporations, each with household-name brands. The report scored companies based on transparency, sustainability, working conditions, chemical use, waste and water management.</p>
<p>Their findings concluded that none of the top 14 corporations, nor their distinct brands, can be considered industry leaders in terms of ethics or the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environment">environment</a>. However, the companies that ranked higher than average include Target, Jan Sport, Nike, Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and The North Face. Companies that scored below average include Ann Taylor, American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, Abercrombie and Fitch, Walmart, Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and Free People.</p>
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Related: Zara pledges 100% sustainable fabrics by 2025 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/zara-pledges-100-sustainable-fabrics-by-2025/" target="_blank">Related: Zara pledges 100% sustainable fabrics by 2025</a></p>
<p>The worst companies, which failed metrics on Green America’s score card, include J. Crew, OshKosh B’gosh and Forever 21.</p>
<p>“Consumers want <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sustainable">sustainable </a>clothing, and the market is responding. But too often, many of the promises we hear from conventional companies are token sustainability initiatives that are band-aids to one small part of the problem, or empty platitudes without a plan to achieve real change. Sustainability shouldn’t just be a marketing trend,&#8221; said Green America’s social justice campaigns manager, Caroline Chen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The report also called out corporations’ practice of promoting “token brands,” or one <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/eco-textile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">eco-textile</a> line that they can use for public relations knowing that consumers will associate their name with sustainability without looking further into the rest of their lines. Similarly, many corporations make sweeping sustainability pledges without specifying metrics nor timelines and hardly follow through with implementation.</p>
<p>Overall, the textile industry uses 43 million tons of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/toxic-chemicals">toxic chemicals</a> every year, and most companies do not disclose the source of their chemicals so it is difficult to understand the health impacts. Green America’s report suggests that those who are concerned about chemicals in clothing should shop at thrift stores and wear clothing until it wears out– this not only helps reduce the amount of new clothing produced, it also reduces how many chemicals you are personally exposed to.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The topic of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sustainability">sustainability</a> is the zeitgeist of our era and there are few industries as predominantly targeted for creating waste, and in turn holding the power for high-impact solutions, as the fashion industry— even those deemed high fashion. Easily identifiable as a luxury brand, Prada now hopes to lead the industry in sustainable action with the production of a new line of bags made from an innovative material, Re-Nylon. </p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/prada-jumps-into-the-sustainability-realm-with-six-re-nylon-bags-made-from-recycled-plastic-waste/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Prada-Re-Nylon_still-life-01LEAD-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Prada-Re-Nylon_still-life-01NEW-889x592.jpg" alt="black recycled nylon bags" class="wp-image-2218111" /></p>
<p>Using recycled materials in fabric production is not a new idea, but the ability to bring together the best sustainability efforts from five continents just might be.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/renewlogy-turns-low-grade-plastic-into-usable-fuels/">Related: Renewlogy turns low-grade plastic into usable fuels</a></p>
<p>Re-Nylon is the result of extensive research and the dedication to sourcing <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/recycled-waste">recycled waste</a>. With this in mind, Prada has collaborated with some leaders in the waste-to-material industry who are proving there are ways to reuse post-consumer products in new and exciting ways. Partnering with Italian textile specialists, Aquafil, materials are sourced from used carpeting, fishing nets and ocean waste across five continents. </p>
<p>One example comes from Phoenix, Arizona, where the world’s first carpet recycling plant diverts some of the 1.6 million tons of carpet discarded annually and converts it into ECONYL nylon used in Prada’s Re-Nylon bags.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/prada-jumps-into-the-sustainability-realm-with-six-re-nylon-bags-made-from-recycled-plastic-waste/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Prada-Re-Nylon_still-life-01LEAD-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Prada-Re-Nylon_backpackNEW-889x592.jpg" alt="black recycled nylon bags" class="wp-image-2218114" /></p>
<p>Putting this waste through a process of depolymerization and re-polymerisation, the end result is a yarn that is endlessly <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/recyclable">recyclable </a>with no reduction in quality. Production facilities in Ljubljana, Slovenia and Arco, Italy receive the recycled plastic and turn it into polymers and threads used to make the initial Re-Nylon line that includes the belt bag, the shoulder bag, a tote bag, a duffle and two Prada backpacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Re-Nylon project goes beyond this initial reveal of six bags with a focus on making sustainability a permanent part of the production plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m very excited to announce the launch of the Prada Re-Nylon collection. Our ultimate goal will be to convert all Prada virgin nylon into Re-Nylon by the end of 2021. This project highlights our continued efforts towards promoting a responsible business. This collection will allow us to make our contribution and create products without using new resources,” says Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group Head of Marketing and Communication</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/prada-jumps-into-the-sustainability-realm-with-six-re-nylon-bags-made-from-recycled-plastic-waste/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Prada-Re-Nylon_still-life-01LEAD-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Prada-Re-Nylon_still-life-03NEW-889x592.jpg" alt="black recycled nylon bags" class="wp-image-2218112" /></p>
<p>In an effort to prove this dedication, a percentage of the profit from each bag is donated to an <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environmental-sustainability">environmental sustainability</a> project. Prada has also partnered with UNESCO to set up an educational programs aimed at teaching youth about conservation of resources, plastic and circular economies so they can lead an awareness campaign on the topic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Helsinki has entered a “new era of libraries” with the completion of Oodi, the Helsinki Central Library that not only serves as a new central point for the city’s public library network but also an award-winning public space with a movie theater, multipurpose hall and more in the heart of the Finnish capital.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/near-net-zero-energy-helsinki-central-library-boasts-an-award-winning-prefab-design/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Oodi-by-ALA-Architects-13-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Oodi-by-ALA-Architects-8-889x593.jpg" alt="exterior entrance under wood canopy" class="wp-image-2218277" /></p>
<p>Designed by local architectural practice ALA Architects, Oodi is the largest public library in the Helsinki metropolitan area and marks the celebratory project of the 100th anniversary of the independence of Finland when it opened in December 2018. In addition to an eye-catching, undulating design, the library follows passive energy principles for extreme energy-efficient performance that reaches near Zero Energy Building (nZEB) status. </p>

<p>Spanning an area of 17,250 square meters, Oodi consists of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/library">library</a> facilities, meeting rooms, group working spaces, a maker space, a living lab, recording studios, a photography studio, editing rooms, offices, a cafe, restaurant, movie theater, auditorium, multi-purpose hall, exhibition facilities and information booths.</p>

<p>The library is divided into three distinct levels: an “active” ground floor, a “peaceful” upper floor that houses the “Book Heaven” and an enclosed in-between “Attic” volume with more specific functions housed inside flexible, irregularly shaped rooms, nooks and corners. To accommodate a large volume of people — the library is expected to attract 10,000 visitors per day and 2.5 million visitors per year — the ground floor has been engineered as a column-free public space.</p>

<p>To ground the contemporary building into its surroundings, the architects constructed Oodi with locally sourced materials, including the 33-millimeter-thick Finnish high-quality spruce cladding used in the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/prefabricated">prefabricated</a> wooden facade. Algorithm-aided parametric design models guided the design and manufacturing of the complex curved geometry. <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/passive-solar">Passive solar</a> design principles, highly efficient building systems and building information modeling has helped keep the library’s energy demands to a minimum.</p>

<p>“The library will enliven and diversify the new urban environment created in the Töölönlahti area,” ALA Architects said. “It will offer activities and experiences for all ages. There will be plenty of spaces that enable people to gather and spend time together, free of charge. The role of the library’s clients will evolve from passive media users to active agents, participants and content producers. As a non-commercial open public space, the new Central Library will act as <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/helsinki/">Helsinki</a> residents’ common living room, work space and learning environment.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Food science labs around the world are aiming to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/vegan-and-lab-grown-meats-predicted-to-take-over-meat-market-in-20-years/">take over the meat industry</a> with alternative protein options, but a new competitor has entered the market: an ambitious and well-resourced 24-year-old entrepreneur named Kim Le. Le&#8217;s fledgling company, called Prime Roots, is planning to launch its alternative meat products in early 2020 and will add its items to shelves already occupied by major companies like Impossible Foods and<a href="https://inhabitat.com/tysons-plant-based-nuggets-could-disrupt-and-dominate-the-market/">Tyson</a>. </p>
<p>While alternative proteins do address the meat industry’s unsustainable impact on the environment, many of them rely on <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/gmo">GMO</a> and lab-grown methods to produce proteins. Prime Roots markets its products as sustainable, non-GMO, whole food-sourced &#8220;superproteins.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/impossible-foods-tests-a-fish-less-fish-protein/">Related: Impossible Foods tests a fish-less fish protein</a></p>
<p>Unlike most corporations, Prime Roots uses a unique, democratic process for selecting the three products that will be available in 2020. It invited its “community of eaters” to vote on the products via <a href="https://primeroots.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the company’s website</a>. The website also boasts promo codes, giveaways and “ambassadors-only events” for potential consumers interested in taking a more active role in the company’s <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/corporate-responsibility">sustainability and promotional efforts</a>.</p>
<p>Months before the products are actually available, the website invites visitors to read-up about alternative <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/protein">proteins</a> and “join the superprotein revolution.”</p>
<p>Le, a recent UC Berkeley graduate, developed the idea for Prime Roots during her time in college. The daughter of famous Vietnamese chef Chi Le, Kim spent her whole life around <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/food">food</a> and went to university specifically to learn more about fermentation science. She got her start as an entrepreneur through UC Berkeley’s Alternative Meat Lab housed at the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology. Her company then began to grow and become a reality through support from IndieBio. Since then, Le has amassed over $4 million in investments through both True Ventures and the Collaborative Fund.</p>
<p>Prime Roots products will include a meat-free chicken and bacon as well as <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/seafood">seafood-less</a> salmon and lobster. You can vote on the products you&#8217;d like to see on shelves first on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://primeroots.com/" target="_blank">the Prime Roots website</a>.</p>

<p>Located on 10 acres framed by the dramatic Montana mountains, the Confluence House comprises three structures— a main house, a guest house and a utility structure— arranged around a protected central <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="courtyard (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/courtyard" target="_blank">courtyard</a>. To blend the low-lying buildings into the landscape, the architects wrapped the exteriors in locally sourced dark-stained wood and stone cladding punctuated with floor-to-ceiling insulated windows that seamlessly bring the outdoors in. Rugged metal roofs with an expansive solar PV system top the structures. </p>

<p>Shaped by the neighboring bluffs, the Confluence House aligns the 2,282-square-foot main house with the west bluff while the 946-square-foot east bluff is aligned with the east bluff. The two-suite guest house is separated from the main house for privacy and is connected by way of a covered porch. “A model of efficient space planning, there are no hallways,” reads the project statement. “The flat-roofed living structures allow the complex to disappear into the horizon line.” The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="indoor/outdoor connection (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/indoor-outdoor-living/" target="_blank">indoor/outdoor connection</a> is emphasized through the abundance of glazing and a natural material palette, from the exposed-aggregate concrete floors that evoke gravel river beds to the whitewashed Douglas fir ceilings that reference weathered wood. </p>

			<description>Scientists and local Icelanders will unveil a monument next month that memorializes the first glacier out of the country’s 400 glaciers to be lost to climate change. The Okjokull glacier, nicknamed "Ok", no longer qualifies as a glacier, given that it is melting at a faster rate than it can expand. When this happens, glaciers become known as “dead ice”. Scientists in Iceland and Texas' Rice University believe that this will be the fate of all Icelandic glaciers by year 2200— unless the world takes drastic action to curb climate change.[...]</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists and local Icelanders will unveil a monument next month that memorializes the first <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/glacier" target="_blank">glacier</a> out of the country’s 400 glaciers to be lost to climate change. The Okjokull glacier, nicknamed &#8220;Ok&#8221;, no longer qualifies as a glacier, given that it is melting at a faster rate than it can expand. When this happens, glaciers become known as “dead ice”. Scientists in Iceland and Texas&#8217; Rice University believe that this will be the fate of all Icelandic glaciers by year 2200— unless the world takes drastic action to curb <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change" target="_blank">climate change</a>.</p>
<p>“By marking Ok’s passing, we hope to draw attention to what is being lost as Earth’s glaciers expire. These bodies of ice are the largest freshwater reserves on the planet and frozen within them are histories of the atmosphere. They are also often important cultural forms that are full of significance,” said Cymene Howe, a professor at Rice University.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/earliest-human-air-pollution-detected-in-glaciers/">Related:Earliest human air pollution detected in glaciers </a></p>
<p>The unveiling celebration will be held on August 18 and attended by scientists, locals, media and Hiking Society members. </p>
<p>Just 100 years ago, the glacier covered nearly six square miles and was over 150 feet thick.</p>
<p>The plaque, located at a site where the glacier once covered, will read: “Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.” The plaque is in both Icelandic and English.</p>
<p>The plaque also monumentalizes</p>
<p>the current count of carbon parts per million in the atmosphere, which reaches</p>
<p>a record breaking 415 parts per million in May.</p>
<p>“An Icelandic colleague said: ‘Memorials are not for the dead; they are for the living,’” Howe said. “We want to underscore that it is up to us, the living, to respond to the rapid loss of glaciers and the ongoing impacts of climate change. For Ok glacier it is already too late.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://inhabitat.com/bouldering-walls-cover-this-tiny-home-built-for-adventure-lovers/">climbing walls</a> to a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/this-beautiful-tiny-home-doubles-as-a-tasty-doughnut-shop/">baker&#8217;s kitchen</a>, tiny homes nowadays can be outfitted with any number of bespoke features. Now, those with a green thumb can enjoy a cabin-style tiny home with a detachable greenhouse. Designed by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/olivenesttinyhomes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Olive Nest Tiny Homes</a>, the Elsa is a gorgeous, pitched-roof home with an interior that opens up to a spacious greenhouse via a breezy pergola with a porch swing.</p>

<p>The Elsa is a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/tiny-homes-on-wheels/">tiny home on wheels</a> with an enviable design on its own. The exterior is clad in warm cedar shiplap siding and topped with an attractive dark gray standing seam metal pitched roof. Fourteen large windows and a glass front door provide plenty of natural light for the interior living space.</p>

<p>The entrance to the home is via a wooden pergola, complete with a charming porch swing. Walking into the interior, guests will find the living space to be incredibly bright with modern decor. White <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/shiplap/">shiplap walls</a>, light-hued wooden trim and recessed lighting open up the space.</p>

<p>Measuring just 323 square feet, the home includes a quaint living room that opens up to the full-sized kitchen with a dining counter. A narrow staircase, which pulls double duty as storage, leads up to the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sleeping-loft/">sleeping loft</a>. Opposed to the oppressive loft spaces often seen in tiny homes, the bedroom is made larger thanks to the vaulted ceiling. In fact, there&#8217;s not only enough space for a queen-sized bed, but there is more than enough room for residents to stand up. The loft features original artwork by <a href="http://www.msusan.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MSusan.</a></p>

<p>Of course, at heart of this tiny home is the fabulous <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/greenhouse/">greenhouse</a> that mounts onto the tiny home, both of which are built on trailers. Connected to the residence by the pergola, the greenhouse is surprisingly spacious with enough room to grow all kinds of fruits, herbs and veggies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every day, news reporters circulate the latest climate studies that seem to prove the world is ending. The reports appear to be working — if the goal of environmental journalists is to inform people of our existential crisis and create panic. Amidst the current fervor of political discontent, scores of people hit the streets for climate protests and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/yes-climate-marches-are-working/">evidence suggests that the marches are working</a> — again, to inform and worry people. Since the release of a U.N. report claiming we have just 12 years to address climate change before it’s too late, hundreds of people have showed up in therapists&#8217; offices with palpable symptoms of what practitioners are now calling “eco-anxiety” or &#8220;climate anxiety.&#8221;</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/climate-anxiety-is-hopelessness-preventing-us-from-confronting-our-biggest-challenge/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/eco-anxiety-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/eco-anxiety-2-889x592.jpg" alt="melting icebergs" class="wp-image-2217170" /></p>
<p><h2>What is eco-anxiety?</h2>
</p>
<p>The term</p>
<p>eco-anxiety entered the lexicon after <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-me-in-we/201801/coming-terms-ecoanxiety">Psychology Today</a> described the</p>
<p>phenomena as “a fairly recent psychological disorder afflicting an increasing</p>
<p>number of individuals who worry about the environmental crisis.” In 2017, a</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.apa.org/images/mental-health-climate_tcm7-215704.pdf">report</a> by the American Psychological Society went viral and described the term as a “chronic fear of environmental doom.”</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate">Climate</a> or eco-anxiety are new terms and no licensed doctor will explicitly diagnose you with it, but it is increasingly discussed with patients, especially among younger patients. As a result, the American Psychological Association published a lengthy manual about climate change to help practitioners guide patients through their anxiety surrounding the climate crisis.</p>
<p><h2>Anxiety doesn’t discriminate</h2>
</p>
<p>Overwhelming feelings of hopelessness in the face of environmental threats around the world and at your doorstep are not specific to any one kind of person. It is not, though it may seem, only for those with enough time to read all the doomsday news, nor only for those who can afford therapists and college counselors. Those directly impacted by climate-related disasters, which are <a href="https://inhabitat.com/weekly-climate-disasters-give-new-urgency-to-resilience/">happening every week</a>, experience “profound negative impacts” on their mental health. Disaster survivors have increased risk of depression, anxiety, anger issues, grief, post-traumatic stress disorders and even suicide. </p>

<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/climate-anxiety-is-hopelessness-preventing-us-from-confronting-our-biggest-challenge/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/eco-anxiety-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/eco-anxiety-3-889x592.jpg" alt="students protesting climate change" class="wp-image-2217171" /></p>
<p><h2>Young people are panicking</h2>
</p>
<p>Youth in particular are stressed out about climate change, so much so that students in more than 70 countries across the world walked out of their classrooms and participated in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/students-around-the-world-join-climate-strike-on-march-15/">Youth Climate Marches</a>. Bombarded with messages about climate catastrophes for the entirety of their short lives, the youngest generation has only experienced a world where global warming is a known fact, yet adults don’t seem to be taking it seriously. Young people overwhelmingly feel despair that they will be left with a dysfunctional world, inherited from careless generations before them.</p>
<p>This year, Harvard reported that <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v76HyyKfhaamPmOeviBHCWKRmBQ3iRjI1tnLTpUXHzw/edit#gid=1739501779">46 percent</a> of people between the ages of 18 to 24 believe <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">climate change</a> is a crisis that requires urgent action, and this conviction is simply not mirrored by those in power. This discrepancy leads young people to feel hopeless and powerless in the face of such a large and impending catastrophe. The American Psychological Association reported that <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/gen-z.aspx">58 percent</a> of people born after 1995 feel stressed when they see news coverage about climate change.</p>
<p><h2>Is anxiety useful, though?</h2>
</p>
<p>How much is climate anxiety is “normal” or at least inevitable? After all, shouldn’t we be enraged by injustice? Shouldn’t we be sickened by the declining health of the planet? Aren’t these visceral reactions part of the process and a catalyst for change? The answer, experts say, depends on how debilitating the emotions are. The difference is between letting your anxiety prevent you from taking action or even living your daily life versus using it to fuel personal and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/politics">political changes</a>.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/climate-anxiety-is-hopelessness-preventing-us-from-confronting-our-biggest-challenge/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/eco-anxiety-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/eco-anxiety-5-889x637.jpg" alt="zero-waste products flat-lay on wood table" class="wp-image-2217183" /></p>
<p><h2>Doctor’s orders: how to use your climate anxiety for good</h2>
</p>
<p>Below are a few tips for finding meaning, hope and progress despite what might seem like an overwhelming and unsolvable crisis.</p>
<p><h3>Start with yourself</h3>
</p>
<p>Even when you feel powerless, you still have the authority to make your own choices and adjust your personal behaviors. Audit your own energy and consumption patterns, and make small changes that help you feel more in control and more sustainable. Consider following a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-going-vegan%ef%bb%bf/">vegan diet</a>, biking to work, refusing single-use plastics or selecting more sustainable shipping options when shopping online.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-online-versus-in-store-shopping/">Related: The pros and cons of online versus in-store shopping</a></p>
<p>“Firstly, make climate change a factor in the decisions you make around what you eat, how you travel and what you buy,” <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/b2e7ee32-ad28-4ec4-89aa-a8b8c98f95a5">said Duncan Greere</a>, editor of the American Psychological Society report on eco-anxiety. “Secondly, talk about climate change with your friends, family and colleagues. Finally, demand that politicians and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/corporate-responsibility">companies</a> make it easier and cheaper to do the right thing for the climate.”</p>
<p><h3>Join a climate action group</h3>
</p>
<p>There are environmental and climate action groups everywhere. Research those in your areas and attend a meeting. Not only will you find solace among others who are similarly concerned, but together you can take small steps that contribute to a larger push toward sustainability. Not all groups are on the front lines protesting; there is diversity in the work that needs to be done, including contacting your representatives, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/scientists-confirm-tree-planting-is-our-best-solution-to-climate-change/">planting trees</a>, organizing beach clean-ups, advocating for <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic-ban">plastic bans</a> and much more.</p>
<p><h3>Participate in a clean-up activity</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic-pollution">Plastic pollution</a> is one of the biggest environmental issues of our time, but there is something you can do about it now. Seeing the change you’ve made by way of a hefty trash pile properly sorted, recycled and sent to the right place can help calm your anxiety, even if just temporarily. Beach and river clean-ups are often organized by neighborhood and community groups or nature conservation groups and can be fun social activities that encourage people to get outside.</p>
<p><h3>Focus on local policy</h3>
</p>
<p>If you are feeling hopeless because the national government isn’t doing enough — and sometimes is doing more harm — focus on making changes at the state or local level. Oftentimes, home-grown legislators are better able to understand the local <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environment">environment</a> and can make more effective policies.</p>
<p>For example, while the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/rep-ocasio-cortez-releases-green-new-deal-resolution/">Green New Deal</a> proposal was causing a ruckus at the national level, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/green-roofs-to-take-over-nyc-skyline-by-law/">New York City passed its own</a> Green New Deal. City and state governments have a better idea about specifically what ecosystems need to be protected, which infrastructure needs to become more resilient and how to pass plastic foam bans without hurting local businesses.</p>
<p><h3>Stay informed about solutions</h3>
</p>
<p>It’s great to</p>
<p>stay informed and up-to-date with the news, but learn to step away from your computer, TV or newspaper when you start to feel overwhelmed or depressed. Seek out sources that provide positive news about people working toward solutions.</p>
<p><h3>See a therapist</h3>
</p>
<p>If your anxiety or depression is disrupting your life and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/health">mental health</a>, don’t hesitate to seek out professional help. No, climate-anxiety cannot be diagnosed, but it manifests similarly as general anxiety, and therapists are well-equipped with tools to help you cope and overcome.</p>

<p>Nestled in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/budapest/">Budapest’s</a> forested hills, the planned condo takes advantage of its lush surroundings with full-height glazing on all floors and covered balconies. The building’s location on a steep plot allows it to be almost completely hidden from view; the top floor will be level with the street. To minimize visual interference with the landscape, the architects have tucked the parking garage underground so that the entrance will be accessed via a footbridge. Rather than fencing, subtle architectural and landscaping solutions were used to mark property lines. </p>

<p>“As our lives become increasingly metropolitan, many of us are seeking to be closer to nature,” the architecture studio explained in a project statement. “The pace of urban life can be exhausting as we lose ourselves to our mobile phones and the digital age, which can make the importance of connections with our fellow humans all the more significant. Restoring our connection with both nature and personal relationships is crucial for a harmonious lifestyle, and that’s the overriding thought behind Benyei’s architecture studio’s latest plan. The modern-day sense of a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/condominiums/">luxury residential space</a> goes beyond quality of design or premium construction materials; the true luxury is a building’s ability to unite family, friends and the silence of nature.”</p>

The building will be topped with an undulating roof that echoes the surrounding hilly topography. The building is slated for completion in 2020.</p>

<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/an-eco-friendly-island-resort-immerses-guests-in-the-wild-beauty-of-northern-norway/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Manshausen-Island-Resort-by-Stinessen-Arkitektur-5-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Manshausen-Island-Resort-by-Stinessen-Arkitektur-1-889x593.jpg" alt="aluminum cabin beside water" class="wp-image-2217763" /></p>
<p>Sandwiched between mountains and sea, Manshausen Island features a dramatic landscape and a harsh climate with long winters and temperamental weather conditions. Despite the short building season, remote location and disagreeable weather conditions, the architects succeeded in developing a low-maintenance and sustainably minded resort with cabins designed in the image of the island’s two main existing structures: the old farm-house and stone quays. Each compact <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/cabin/">cabin</a> was crafted for minimum impact on the landscape; the resort team plans to make the island self-sufficient by 2020 and all waste is already treated on the island.</p>

<p>As with the original cabins at the resort, the new cabins in the extension — dubbed Manshausen 2.0 — have been built from <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/cross-laminated-timber/">cross-laminated timber</a>, aluminum sheet cladding and custom, full-height glazing that allows for unobstructed views of the landscape. Prefabricated elements were used for “plug and play” installation of the shelters. Each 30-square-meter cabin was designed to be as compact as possible yet can comfortably accommodate up to four to five people and includes a kitchen and plenty of storage space.</p>

<p>“Although [the new cabins] enjoy much of the same undisturbed sea views, the positioning in the landscape offers a unique approach to the design,” the architects explained. “Wave heights, extreme weather conditions and also future <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sea-level-rise/">raise in sea level</a> were studied to determine the exact positions of the cabins.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The largest bird in North America is making a comeback after reaching an alarming population size of about 20 <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/birds">birds</a>. The California condor was highly endangered during the late 20th century but holds spiritual importance to indigenous tribes and nature-lovers. Last week, conservationists announced that the 1,000th chick hatched and successfully survived, giving new hope that the birds&#8217; population will continue to grow.</p>
<p>The condor population plummeted in the 20th century because of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/hunting">hunting</a>, habitat loss and lead poisoning from eating the carcasses of animals that had been shot with lead bullets. When the population was nearing just 20 birds, conservationists began breeding them in captivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/10-species-at-risk-of-extinction-under-the-trump-administration/">Related: 10 species at risk of extinction under the Trump administration</a></p>
<p>According to Tim Hauch, manager of the Peregrine Fund&#8217;s condor program, more than 300 wild California condors exist today. There is a total of more than 500 when those in captivity are included.</p>
<p>The newest chick was born in Zion National Park, located in southwestern Utah. Condors lay only <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/bird-cams-faq-california-condor-nest/">one egg at a time</a>, and female condors do not nest every year. Conservationists are incredibly hopeful every time one is born.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing more chicks born in the wild than we ever have before,&#8221; Hauck told NPR. &#8220;And that&#8217;s just a step toward success for the condor and achieving a sustainable population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the</p>
<p>chick was born in May, it was not considered to be a survivor until July, given the typical mortality of young condors within the first two months. The chick will be able to leave the nest and begin flying around November.</p>
<p>California condors are unique birds that can live up to 60 years in the right conditions. That makes condors not only the largest bird in North America, with a wingspan of 10 feet, but also one of the longest living birds in the world. Those who study California condors also believe that the birds are capable of having distinct personalities, which separates them from many other avian species.  </p>

<p>Topped with a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/green-roof">green roof</a> that shares space with a solar array, the home was built with a number of passive and active design measures. The rectangular volume is made up of two levels: an open-air ground floor and an upper floor clad in exposed brick with a long interior hallway lined in glass panels. The upper level houses the master bedroom and the kids&#8217; bedrooms.</p>

<p>The social spaces are all located on the first floor, which contains a living room, entertainment area, dining room and a large chef&#8217;s kitchen in the middle. Wrapped around a central <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/courtyard/">courtyard</a>, these wall-less living spaces are all connected, creating a seamless connection between the rooms as well as the interior and the exterior. Native vegetation was used in the landscaping to create a lush outdoor area.</p>

<p>The main living areas all maintain a nice, cool temperature year-round thanks to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-ventilation/">natural air circulation</a>. Additionally, the second level was built with overhangs that shade the ground floor, creating a more comfortable space for residents to take in the fresh air. There is also a small swimming pool as well as a wooden sauna and dressing room in the backyard.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Californian city of Berkeley has become the first in the country to pass a ban on natural gas piping in new buildings, including private homes. Although it is considered cleaner than oil, natural gas is still a fossil fuel and contributes to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/global-warming/">global warming</a>. New buildings in Berkeley, with few exceptions, will have to rely on electricity for heating water and kitchen appliances starting in January 2020.</p>
<p>The natural gas ordinance was spearheaded by councilmember Kate Harrison, who told the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Berkeley-becomes-first-U-S-city-to-ban-natural-14102242.php?psid=dINLG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, “It’s an enormous issue. We need to really tackle this. When we think about pollution and climate change issues, we tend to think about factories and cars, but all buildings are producing <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gas</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/california-becomes-the-first-us-state-to-require-solar-energy-for-new-houses/">Related: California is the first US state to require solar energy for new houses</a></p>
<p>The legislation passed unanimously, but some critics outside of the city town halls and council meetings argue that electricity prices are higher than <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-gas">natural gas</a>. The mandate will come at an expense to homeowners and renters in the Bay Area’s already stifling housing market. </p>
<p>The ordinance also</p>
<p>comes with funding for a two-year position for one staff member in the Office</p>
<p>of Planning and Development who will oversee the implementation of the ban.</p>
<p>David Hochschild, chairman of the California Energy Commission, reported that at least 50 other cities throughout the state of California are considering such a ban in hopes of addressing the contribution that buildings make to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">climate change</a> and to encourage higher usage of electricity and renewable energy.</p>
<p>Berkeley has a history of progressive bans, including becoming the first city in the country to ban smoking in restaurants and bars back in 1977. Earlier this year, the city banned single-use plastic utensils in restaurants (such as <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a> forks). Restaurants and cafes throughout the city must use compostable utensils for takeaway meals and beverages. The city also passed an ordinance adding a 25 cents tax onto single-use cups, such as coffee cups.</p>

<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/wilkinsoneyre-gets-green-light-for-giant-geothermal-powered-biodome-in-iceland/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Aldin-Biodomes-by-WilkinsonEyre-2-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Aldin-Biodomes-by-WilkinsonEyre-1-889x515.jpg" alt="rendering people walking on trail near white domes" class="wp-image-2217788" /></p>
<p>Spanning approximately 48,000 square feet, the Aldin Biodomes will consist of a Main Nature Dome and a Tropical Dome. Elevated on a hilltop, the domes are designed to be seen from the city skyline and will catch the eye with undulating forms and glittering glass facades. The complex will be located on the edge of the outdoor recreational area Elliðaárdalur in the center of the Capital region, where it will serve as a new gateway to the largest green area closest to Reykjavik. The domes are oriented toward the northwest for guaranteed views of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/Iceland/">Iceland’s</a> midnight sunsets during summer and the Northern Lights in wintertime.</p>

<p>The geothermal-powered <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/biodomes">Aldin Biodomes</a> are envisioned as a year-round attraction offering more than just a welcome escape into a tropical environment during the harsh winters. In the lush Tropical Dome, visitors can enjoy a rich showcase of exotic plants as well as the Farm Lab, an educational environment on local food production. The Main Nature Dome will house a multifunctional space with a reception, an information area, a specialty restaurant, a visitors’ shop and a marketplace that emphasizes Iceland’s fresh products.</p>

<p>“The unique and thought-provoking environments of the Biodomes are eye-catching visual landmarks on the city skyline,” said a statement on Spor í sandinn’s website. “Close attention is paid on the choice of materials, their aesthetic qualities and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sustainability/">sustainability</a>. Each structure catches and reflects the ever-shifting play of light from day to day and season to season — similarly to the burgeoning plant-life within. Striking colors, forms and textures of the vegetation, and the bustling throngs of visitors, will create a world of magic and a feast for the senses and the imagination.”</p>

<p>Currently trending on Indiegogo, the Cyclo helmet was created by a few people who have been in the design realm for a while, with notable careers as engineers at Aston Martin and Boeing. The Cyclo offers users packability never before seen in a helmet. That’s because of the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/product-design">unique design</a> that allows the rounded upper portion to flip over into the lower part of the helmet frame. Released with a durable clip, the movable parts stay securely in place during use. The helmet is built to exceed all U.S., European and Canadian standards.</p>

<p>While packability was a significant goal during the design phase, co-founders Josh Cohen, CEO, Dom Cotton, CMO and Will Wood, design engineer, felt the pull of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/corporate-responsibility">corporate responsibility</a>. With sustainability becoming a hot topic in every industry, the team decided to incorporate recycled materials into the helmet. By partnering with Plastic Oceans U.K., Cyclo supports efforts to clean up significant plastic pollution in the ocean. As a result, each helmet represents 20 water bottles removed from marine ecosystems.</p>

<p>Sparked by a helmet-less ride Cohen experienced while <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/cycling">cycling</a> in London, the helmet is aimed at convenience to encourage a higher user rate. Environmentally responsible, portable and safe, the Cyclo can be worn when riding scooters, skateboards, bikes or segways. With the compact design, it easily slides into a backpack, gym bag or work bag. “Josh’s experience of riding in London highlighted a clear gap in the market,&#8221; Cotton said. &#8220;Helmets are really important but can be inconvenient, especially for urban riders. We’ve created something that will help more people to ride more often and protect themselves and our planet in the process.”</p>

			<description>In the frenzy to ban plastic utensils, foam containers, straws and single-use bags, the world’s No. 1 most-littered item has been mostly ignored: cigarette butts. Perhaps because they are small in size, two out of every three cigarettes are simply flung to the ground rather than properly disposed of. This adds up to 4.5 trillion cigarette butts every year piling up in parks, cities and oceans. New research suggests that the butts are not just unsightly; they are also negatively impacting plants.[...]</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the frenzy to ban plastic utensils, foam containers, straws and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/single-use">single-use</a> bags, the world’s No. 1 most-littered item has been mostly ignored: cigarette butts. Perhaps because they are small in size, two out of every three cigarettes are simply flung to the ground rather than properly disposed of. This adds up to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2019-07-cigarette-butts-forgotten-plastic-pollutionand.html">4.5 trillion</a> cigarette butts every year piling up in parks, cities and oceans. New research suggests that the butts are not just unsightly; they are also negatively impacting plants.</p>
<p>A <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651319307481?via%3Dihub">study</a> published in <em>Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety</em> compared plants grown in soil containing cigarette butts with a group of control plants and found a significant difference. The plants grown in dirt with cigarettes had shoots that were up to 25 percent shorter with root biomass that was up to 60 percent smaller. Similar <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29154589.pdf">studies</a> from as early as 1913 found similarly negative effects of cigarette smoke on <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plants">plants</a>, but few focus on the impact of butts within the soil.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/californias-butt-lady-picks-up-1000000-littered-cigarette-butts-in-3-5-years/">Related: California&#8217;s &#8220;Butt Lady&#8221; picks up 1M littered cigarette butts in 3.5 years</a></p>
<p>Cigarettes are actually <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/biodegradable">biodegradable</a> but can take years to decompose. In the meantime, the discarded butts are filled with chemicals that, at this point, everyone knows are toxic and carcinogenic. </p>
<p>Since the 1980s, urban and coastal clean-up events have reported that between 30 to 40 percent of the litter collected is typically cigarette butts. It is clearly a major issue in terms of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pollution">pollution</a> and waste, so why aren’t people outraged by it?</p>
<p>Some environmental advocates argue that filters should be banned completely, since they have negligible health benefits to the smoker. Others argue that a deposit-and-return system could be established, where smokers must return their used butts in order to reclaim a deposit. This scheme seems fairly unlikely, but so did bans on <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic-ban">plastic bags</a> or diapers — yet municipalities and countries have successfully put them into effect.</p>

<p>At the 2019 IATA Annual General Meeting in Seoul, KLM President &amp; CEO Pieter Elbers and Dean of the Netherlands Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology Professor Henri Werij signed an agreement to work together on making aviation more sustainable. Though the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/design">design </a>is only a concept at this point, the vision of the Technical University of Berlin and researchers at Delft, the Flying V is a monumental step towards sustainable aviation.</p>

<p>With a unique aerodynamic shape, the plane’s design is shorter than the Airbus A350 (the most comparable aircraft), but with the same wingspan and the same passenger capacity. Because of this, the plane will fit easily into existing gates and runways, and fit in the same hanger as an A350. Everything from the plane bathrooms to the design of the passenger seats are as lightweight as possible for the safety and comfort of passengers. The signature v-shape wings will include the passenger cabins, the cargo (which will hold the same volume as the A350) and the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fuel">fuel</a> and the combination of a lightweight design with fuel-efficient turbofan engines makes it much more <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sustainability">sustainable </a>than other aircrafts.&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bringing reusable bags to stores is now second nature to many shoppers, but will they bring their own containers, too? British supermarket chain Waitrose will find out during an 11-week trial in its Oxford store called Waitrose Unpacked. </p>
<p>Customers are encouraged to take refillable containers to restock on options such as a choice of four types of beer and wines, detergent, coffee and 28 dry products including cereals, lentils and pastas. Other unpacked concepts simply eliminate <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a>— such as 160 loose vegetable and fruit products, and flowers and plants wrapped in 100% <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/recycle">recyclable </a>craft paper rather than plastic. Waitrose also offers a frozen pick and mix station, where customers can choose their own blends of cherries, pineapple, blueberries and other chilly fruits.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/sustainable-toiletries-packaged-in-soap-aim-to-eliminate-single-use-plastics/">Related: Sustainable toiletries packaged in soap aim to eliminate single-use plastics </a></p>
<p>Waitrose launched its Unpacked initiative in response to customers requesting more <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sustainability">sustainable </a>ways to shop. &#8220;This test has huge potential to shape how people might shop with us in the future so it will be fascinating to see which concepts our customers have an appetite for. We know we&#8217;re not perfect and have more to do, but we believe this is an innovative way to achieve something different,&#8221; Waitrose declared in a press release.</p>
<p>Unpacked customers will also benefit from lower prices, since shoppers often pay for excess <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/packaging">packaging </a>they don’t even want. The <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="BBC  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48498346" target="_blank">BBC </a>reported that produce in the supermarket’s refill stations would be up to 15 percent cheaper and frozen fruit would also be less expensive.</p>
<p>For a £5 deposit, shoppers can load their <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/grocery-stores">groceries </a>into a borrowed box from Waitrose to take home. When they return the box, the supermarket refunds their money.</p>
<p>Waitrose will continue to offer <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/food">food </a>in its regular packaging, which will provide a useful control group for the unpacked experiment. The trial ends August 18. We hope the verdict is a win for sustainability.</p>

<p>Located in the São Paulo neighborhood of Ribeirão Preto, the Toca do Urso Brewery offers beer-lovers a serene yet vibrant place to test out a wide selection of craft beers. From the start of the project, the architectural team from SuperLimão Studio knew that to create a comfortable spot that was <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/energy-efficiency/">energy-efficient</a>, it would have to battle the extreme heat and humidity common to the region.</p>

<p>The first step in the design process was to create a space that would be partially embedded into the landscape, adding a natural insulating envelope that would cool down the interior throughout the year. Additionally, in going with a circular shape, the team would be able to create a continual system of natural ventilation.</p>

<p>The exterior is made out of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/gabion-walls/">gabion walls</a> comprised of rocks found on-site that add to the thermal comfort of the structure. In addition, these rock walls reduce sound levels so that when the hall is crowded, noise is directed to the outdoor area. Additionally, it blocks the traffic noise from the adjacent highway.</p>

<p>A large, circular hall was buried almost 5 feet underground to create an ultra-tight earthen envelope. The land that was removed in the process was relocated to the front part of the structure and used to create a sloped entryway. Cold air is swept downward into the building to create a cool <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/microclimate/">microclimate</a>, which is enhanced further by the native vegetation that was planted in abundance to provide shade from the searing heat.</p>

<p>Visitors enter the building through the sloped walkway, which leads into a covered patio with plenty of seating. Inside the hall, a massive skylight optimizes natural circulation and bathes the interior in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-light/">sunlight</a>.</p>

<p>In the center of the brewery, there is a mirror of water and a set of canals. These canals lead air and water through grates in the floor so that the interior air is humidified by the water and in constant circulation, cooling down the interior significantly in comparison to the outdoor temps. In fact, the building&#8217;s various <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/passive-design/">passive measures</a> enable an internal temperature that is approximately 15˚ Celsius lower than the outside temps.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re focused on sustainability and/or <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/zero-waste/">zero waste</a>, you probably cringe every time you return home from the grocery store and pull out bag after bag of fruits and vegetables, each tucked inside plastic bags conveniently located in the produce section where you shopped. The good news is that it’s easy to end the cringe with reusable cloth produce bags. </p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/how-to-easily-make-your-own-reusable-produce-bags/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/34-889x316.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/mainlaura-mitulla-52-C-a008FI-unsplash-889x592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2217214"/></p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s easy to make your own cloth produce bags at very little cost. There are even no-sew options if a sewing machine isn’t your thing. The best part is that you likely already have everything you need to whip up a pile of reusable cloth bags this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/raeburn-upcycles-north-face-tents-into-one-of-a-kind-bags/">Related: RÆBURN upcycles North Face tents into one-of-a-kind bags</a></p>
<p><h2><strong>Material</strong></h2>
</p>
<p>An old, but freshly washed, bed sheet makes the perfect upcycle material for your cloth produce bags. Alternately, grab some lightly-used pillow cases. These work great since they already have seams on some of the sides. Ideally, you will want cotton or linen and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/benefits-of-organic-food-go-beyond-vitamins-and-minerals/organic-produce/">organic</a> is always best, but remember that turning one product into something else is already an eco-friendly action so give yourself a break if your sheets aren’t organic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The linen closet is an easy place to start, but it’s certainly not the only place to find material in your home. Old clothing is an accessible option, especially when you look for shapes that make produce bags easier to make. For example, a child’s shirt will only need small adaptations to turn into a bag. Same goes for wide sleeves or a tight skirt.&nbsp;</p>
<p><h2><strong>No sew</strong></h2>
</p>
<p>Sewing just might not be your thing. Perhaps you don’t have a sewing machine, or you don’t enjoy the whole needle and thread experience. That’s fine with us. To use no-sew <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/reusable">reusable</a> produce bags, simply use Velcro instead. Lay your fabric pieces out inside out. Glue Velcro to the length of each side and allow the strips to dry. Then press the Velcro pieces together completely. Use high-quality Velcro for a firm hold.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/how-to-easily-make-your-own-reusable-produce-bags/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/34-889x316.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/fabric-scissors-needle-needles-461035-889x592.jpg" alt="gold scissors and orange thread" class="wp-image-2217050"/></p>
<p><h2><strong>Sew</strong></h2>
</p>
<p>Making your own produce bags doesn’t require extensive sewing experience. Simply cut and lay out two rectangles of fabric, back to back (or inside out). You can make bags in a variety of sizes. Sew the edges of three sides, leaving the top open. If you are using a material with existing seams, finish the additional edges. For example, cut a pillowcase in four quarters, turn each quarter inside out, finish the seams and turn it back right side out to see your completed bag. </p>
<p><h2><strong>The top</strong></h2>
</p>
<p>Now you have your <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/upcycled-materials/">upcycled</a> produce bag ready to go, but you may be wondering how to keep it closed once you stuff your favorite produce inside. The answer is that you don’t really need to if your bag is deep enough. However, if you prefer to have a top that closes, there are several ways you can go about it. </p>
<p>For those that enjoyed the sewing portion, go ahead and add a drawstring to the top. To do this, fold over the material at the top leaving about 1/2 inch before making a seam. The 1/2 inch gap allows room for a piece of rope or that non-partnered shoelace in the junk drawer. You can lay it into the space before stitching it up, but be sure not to stitch over it, which locks it into a stationary position and will inhibit the bag from pulling closed. </p>
<p>For a no-sew option attach the two sides with Velcro. An even easier solution is to close the top while you’re at the grocery store or farmer’s market using a hair tie band. The elasticity allows the cashier to peak inside the bag hassle free. Plus, if you use your produce bag in the bulk section, you can attach the product number tag directly to the tie band.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/how-to-easily-make-your-own-reusable-produce-bags/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/34-889x316.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/4659196541_48d16ba890_o-889x592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2217049"/></p>
<p><h2><strong>Other Uses</strong></h2>
</p>
<p>Produce bags are never just for produce. You can use them to store any number of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/food/">foods</a>. Beans are an excellent example. Rice, pasta and other pantry items also store well in fabric bags. Shopping bulk is a sustainable action that removes much of the packaging waste from the typical shopping venture. While glass jars are best for some things, fabric bags can handle the “bulk” of your dried foods. Outside the food realm you can use them to store art supplies such as markers, paint brushes and rocks. When it comes time to do laundry, throw small items such as kid’s socks inside and wash the entire bag. </p>
<p><h2><strong>Care</strong></h2>
</p>
<p>Fabric produce bags are easy to care for because they are machine washable alongside the rest of your laundry. It’s best to wash bags after each use considering the amount of germs they encounter in the shopping cart, at checkout and in your car. Bags can be hung to dry or tossed into the dryer if necessary. Remember to put your bags somewhere you will remember to take them with you for your next shopping trip, or take them directly to the car for storage. Congratulations on your step towards reducing <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic-waste/">plastic waste</a>!</p>

			<description>In a bid to revitalize the Norwegian city of Bergen, London-based architectural practice Waugh Thistleton Architects has proposed Trenezia, a masterplan that would transform the coastal city into a shining example of zero-carbon urban development. The mixed-use development would consist of over 1,600 homes and be built on the waters of Store Lungegårdsvann, a bay that separates the city center from the southern boroughs of the city. Energy demands and the carbon footprint would be minimized through site-specific, environmentally responsible design and the use of carbon-sequestering timber as a primary construction material for all of the houses.[...]</description>

<p>Created in collaboration with local architects Artec, Urban System Design, Degree of Freedom and landscape design firm East, the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/zero-carbon/">zero-carbon</a> Trenezia masterplan was created for the BOB, a Norwegian housing association with a goal of building sustainably in urban areas. In addition to promoting sustainable ideals, Trenezia aims to revitalize the city center, which the architects said is currently suffering from depopulation as people move to the outskirts to live in suburban family homes. </p>

<p>Edged in by mountains and water, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/bergen">Bergen’s</a> city center has little land left for development. As a result, the architects decided to build on the lake. “Perfectly placed between the historic town and the new cultural arts hub to the east, the Store Lungegårdsvannet Lake is the ideal site for a new cultural and residential center,” the team explained in a press release. A new boardwalk would span the lake and serve as a &#8216;central spine&#8217; that connects the public-facing elements, which includes a swimming pool and sailing club, retail, performance spaces and cafes.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/zero-carbon-masterplan-on-the-water-aims-to-revitalize-bergens-urban-growth/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Trenezia-by-Waugh-Thistleton-Architects-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Trenezia-by-Waugh-Thistleton-Architects-7-889x710.jpg" alt="rendering of waterfront buildings" class="wp-image-2216136"/></p>
<p>More than 1,600 homes would be placed behind the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/boardwalk">boardwalk</a>. The new homes would stress intergenerational interaction and offer a range of accommodation from family houses to co-living to student flats to sheltered housing both for private sale and rent. The homes, which will be built from timber, echo the gabled rooflines of Bergen’s iconic wooden houses that helped earn the city a place on UNESCO’s World Heritage List. </p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/zero-carbon-masterplan-on-the-water-aims-to-revitalize-bergens-urban-growth/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Trenezia-by-Waugh-Thistleton-Architects-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Trenezia-by-Waugh-Thistleton-Architects-8-889x679.jpg" alt="rendering of buildings along a boardwalk" class="wp-image-2216137"/></p>
<p>“The masterplan, by virtue of its form, responds to the local climate through the creation of solar corridors through the site to maximize sunlight and daylight into every home,” the architects said. “Residential fingers are separated by canals with individual and communal boat moorings and pontoons for residents, creating a comfortable environment where people can be healthy, happy and productive.”</p>

			<description>Danish architectural firm COBE has unveiled designs for a new science museum in the Swedish university city of Lund that will be powered not only with rooftop solar energy but also with pedal power. Museum visitors will be invited to help generate electricity for the carbon-neutral museum by riding “energy bikes” on its concave roof. Constructed primarily from prefabricated cross-laminated timber, the eco-friendly building will be a sustainable landmark and help cement Lund’s position as a science city on the international stage.[...]</description>

<p>Winner of an international competition, COBE’s proposal for the science museum will be located in the heart of the city’s new urban district, Science Villa Scandinavia. The <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/museum">museum</a> will be sandwiched between the high-tech institutions ESS (European Spallation Source) and MAX IV, which are currently under construction and slated to become the world’s most powerful and advanced research facilities within neutron and X-ray research. The science museum’s purpose is to make the institutions’ groundbreaking research more accessible and inviting to both children and adults and to promote general interest in natural science and research. </p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/carbon-neutral-science-museum-in-sweden-will-be-powered-by-bicycles/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Lund-science-museum-by-COBE-2-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Lund-science-museum-by-COBE-4-889x800.jpg" alt="open roof with leafy gardens below" class="wp-image-2215729" /></p>
<p>Spanning a total floor space of 3,500 square meters, the two-story science museum will comprise exhibition halls, a gallery, a reception area, workshops, a museum shop, a restaurant, offices and an auditorium. A viewing platform and patio will top the concave 1,600-square-meter roof as will energy bikes and a solar array large enough to meet the museum’s electricity needs. A large, nature-filled <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/atrium">atrium</a> will sit at the heart of the museum to help absorb carbon dioxide, boost biodiversity and serve as a water reservoir and overflow canal in case of extreme rainfall. Excess heat from ESS will be used to heat the museum through an ectogrid system. The timber building is expected to reach completion by 2024. </p>

<p>“Ambitions for the design of the museum have been sky-high, and we feel that we have succeeded in designing a unique and inviting building, whose open atrium and concave roof lend it a dramatic and elegant profile that stands out and offers novel and innovative ways of using a museum,” said Dan Stubbergaard, architect and founder of COBE. “Moreover, we have made climate, environment and sustainability integral aspects of the process from the outset. By choosing wood as the main construction material, incorporating solar cells, using excess heat and creating an atrium with a rich biodiversity and a rainwater reservoir, among other features, we have achieved our goal and succeeded in creating a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-neutral">CO2-neutral</a> building, if the design is realized as intended. Our hope, as architects, is that we can continue to increase the focus on and improve our ability to create sustainable architecture and construction for the benefit of future generations and the condition of the planet.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sustainability might be the last thought on your mind when a loved one dies, but one entrepreneur believes that everyone can be eco-friendly in life and in death. A remarkable <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/mushroom">mushroom suit</a> is available to be worn by the deceased during their burial, and it offers a way to limit the environmental impact of traditional funerals.</p>
<p>The impact of conventional funeral practices is little known and rarely discussed. Coffins require the harvesting and chemical treatment of wood, including toxic varnishes. Dead bodies are almost always pumped full of formaldehyde, which is a highly poisonous embalming chemical that is released into the environment. Cremation is another option, but it is not without its own negative impact. The cremation process is highly <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/energy">energy-intensive</a> and requires sustained temperatures of up to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/washington-becomes-the-first-state-to-allow-human-composting/">Related: Washington State becomes first state to allow human composting</a></p>
<p>The &#8220;Infinity Burial Suit&#8221; weaves mushroom spores into the suit’s threads so that mushrooms grow on the body and swiftly decompose it by feeding off the nutrients. Mushrooms are beneficial decomposers and help to <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-mushroom-suit-digests-your-body-after-you-die">neutralize soil</a> by digesting and filtering contaminants such as <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pesticides">pesticides</a> or heavy metals. </p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/entrepreneur-sells-mushroom-suits-that-decompose-your-body-after-death/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/infinity-burial-suit-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/infinity-burial-suit-2-889x592.jpg" alt="person wearing black suit on TED Talk stage" class="wp-image-2217778" /></p>
<p>The suit has been for sale since 2016 on the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://coeio.com/infinity-burial-suit-2/">company’s website</a>. It costs $1,500 USD and is available in both black and natural colors and in three sizes. The team behind the suit also offers alternative burial options for pets.</p>
<p>Other companies have attempted to address this environmental issue with the release of a burial pod that <a href="https://inhabitat.com/with-bios-urns-public-launch-everyone-can-grow-a-plant-with-their-loved-ones-remains/">grows into a tree</a> and the opening of funeral buildings for communal decomposition. Like the mushroom suit, these ideas have received a lot of controversy.</p>
<p>According to Jae Rhim Lee, the owner of the mushroom suit company, society needs to shift how we think about death in general, and the mushroom suit is an important step.</p>
<p>&#8220;For every person who uses the Infinity Burial Suit, there will be many more who witness the choice to return to the earth and to use one’s body in a beneficial way,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Cumulatively, this will help create a cultural shift toward a cultural acceptance of death and our personal responsibility for environmental sustainability.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish architect Öznur Pınar Çer’s firm <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://maskarchitects.com/" target="_blank">MASK Architects</a> has designed a sustainably minded pavilion proposed for Waldspielpark Heinrich Kraft Park, the largest forest game park in Frankfurt, Germany.

<p>Shaped like an ovate leaf, the Leaf and Bean Co Pavilion will span an area of more than 2,000 square feet across two floors. The <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pavilion">pavilion&#8217;s</a> ground floor will be semi open and house exhibition space, while the upper level will include the coffee shop with the service areas placed inside a circular core at the heart of the building. Optimization of views of the surrounding forest informed the decisions for placing the programming.</p>

<p>In addition to providing structural support, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/timber">locally sourced timber</a> will be used to give the pavilion a sculptural appeal. The architects propose crisscrossing long timber blocks around the building exterior for a nest-like appearance that evokes branches in a forest. Large amounts of glazing wrap around the building to create an immersive experience in nature. The roof of the pavilion directly above the coffee service areas will be planted with trees and greenery visible from the coffee shop below. </p>

<p>“We carried out a design in which people can provide unforgettable experience without disturbing the mathematics and physics of nature,&#8221; Öznur Pınar Çer said in a press statement. &#8220;This pavilion can be adapted to any kind of forest area, the development offers visitors an escape from the city with the celebration of fresh and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/organic">organic</a> dining. A hub educating and reestablishing gastronomy&#8217;s historic and appropriate connection with nature. Guests may enjoy the leisure and programmed resting on the terrace level while connected with the natural forest. By wandering in the forest, visitors not only discover co-creation programs but also meet with the people involved with the project and explore their creative process.”</p>

			<description>This week, major fashion brand Zara announced a pledge to use 100 percent sustainable fabrics by 2025.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, major fashion brand Zara announced a pledge to use 100 percent sustainable fabrics by 2025. The company also upped the ante for large-scale sustainable fashion by promising to use 80 percent <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> for its headquarters, factories and stores by the same deadline.</p>
<p>“We need to be a force for change, not only in the company but in the whole sector,&#8221; said Pablo Isla, CEO of Inditex, the corporation that owns Zara. &#8220;We are the ones establishing these targets; the strength and impulse for change is coming from the commercial team, the people who are working with our suppliers, the people working with fabrics.”</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/hm-releases-sustainable-fashion-line-made-from-fruit-and-algae/">Related: H&amp;M releases sustainable fashion line from fruit and algae</a></p>
<p>Inditex is the third-largest apparel company in the world and promises that its other brands, including Massimo Dutti, will follow Zara’s example. Zara is by far the corporation&#8217;s largest brand, pulling in 70 percent of its sales, which totaled $29 billion USD last year. A major component of the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/corporate-responsibility">sustainability plan</a> involves increasing the offerings and sales from Zara’s eco-conscious line, Join Life.</p>
<p>Zara also partners with the Red Cross to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/charity">donate</a> leftover stock and has an ongoing project with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to innovate new ways to recycle fabrics.</p>
<p>The announcements come after increased pressure from consumers worldwide who seek sustainable fashion choices and critique the waste generated by the fast fashion industry. Zara claims it is not &#8220;<a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fast-fashion">fast fashion</a>,&#8221; even though a documentary recently revealed that factory workers are judged by a woman holding a stopwatch and that the time between spotting a trend and having it hit Zara stores is only <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/zara-sustainable-initiatives">2 to 4 weeks</a>. Most fashion brands, by comparison, take 40 weeks.</p>
<p>Critics and experts of the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fashion">fashion</a> industry noted that the new sustainability plan does not address concerns about the conditions for factory workers, despite recent controversies when disgruntled workers stitched <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/11/179593/zara-hidden-messages-factory-workers-turkey">S.O.S. notes</a> into Zara clothing.</p>

<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/natures-silent-soldiers-aiding-in-the-fight-against-air-pollution/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/06/shutterstock_562927264banner-889x320.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/06/shutterstock_562927264-889x592.jpg" alt="adult and child use their hands to plant a tree in soil" class="wp-image-2212528" /></p>
<p>We already know that nature can <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.stanford.edu/2015/06/30/hiking-mental-health-063015/" target="_blank">improve mental health</a>. It can inspire positive engagement with community and provide the kind of groundedness one needs to live in the moment. A 2017 study published in the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2016.1221126" target="_blank">Journal of Positive Psychology</a> examined the emotional effects of taking time to notice nature versus human-built objects by dividing participants into three different groups. The group instructed to pay more attention to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/nature">nature </a>had significantly higher levels of elevating experiences, a sense of connectedness and intent to help others. That means you don’t necessarily have to plan an epic week-long camping trip (though that sounds great!) to reap nature’s benefits. Something as simple as walking through a park on your morning commute or stopping to admire a tree at the bus stop can create positive effects. </p>

<p>A report <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://thought-leadership-production.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/10/28/17/17/50/0615788b-8eaf-4b4f-a02a-8819c68278ef/20160825_PHA_Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">published by the Nature Conservatory</a> in 2016 found that investing $100 million annually in tree planting in cities could provide cooler temperatures for 77 million people and cleaner air for 68 million people. That’s a pretty important statistic, considering that a “vast majority” of humanity will be living in cities, towns and other urban areas by the year 2050. When it comes to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pollution">pollution</a>, the bulk of cities are most greatly affected by particulate matter, AKA the consequence of burning fossil fuels from cars and factories. Fine particulate matter inhalation into the lungs alone causes an estimated 3.2 million deaths per year from complications such as stroke, heart disease and respiratory illness. According to the report, by the year 2050 this number could almost double if something isn’t done. The good news is, the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2014/nrs_2014_nowak_001.pdf" target="_blank">leaves of trees</a> act as an absorber of these pesky pollutants, and the matter itself can get caught or retained on the tree surfaces. </p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/natures-silent-soldiers-aiding-in-the-fight-against-air-pollution/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/06/shutterstock_562927264banner-889x320.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/06/shutterstock_95030080-889x592.jpg" alt="view of tall tree illuminated by sun rays from the ground" class="wp-image-2212527" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, we already have some of the answers to these pressing problems. The Nature Conservatory studied 245 cities in 2016 to find that trees are already providing humans with benefits such as reductions in fine particulate matter and reduction in summer maximum <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">temperatures</a>, and that was just the trees that were already there. Significant tree cover in cities can also help reduce the need for air conditioning, reducing utility costs and lowering <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/energy">energy </a>usage. </p>
<p>Tree planting, when combined with other strategies, appears to be a cost-effective, simple way to improve the environment and soak up air pollution, all while beautifying the neighborhood. In order to make this approach most effective, the types of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/trees">trees </a>planted must be considered as well. Trees with larger leaves provide more sufficient shade and are more productive in absorbing pollutants. Species that are less susceptible to drought may also be considered in areas where water is more scarce. Maintenance is another factor to consider, as it may not cost much to plant the trees in the first place, but watering, pruning and protecting against diseases all require added costs and labor for city trees.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/natures-silent-soldiers-aiding-in-the-fight-against-air-pollution/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/06/shutterstock_562927264banner-889x320.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/06/shutterstock_580933222-889x592.jpg" alt="person used shovel to pour soil into planted tree" class="wp-image-2212529" /></p>
<p>Trees aren’t the only air purifiers in the natural world. Certain types of moss can produce oxygen while binding environmental <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/emissions">toxins </a>such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which at high levels can damage the ozone layer and human lungs. Berlin-based company Green City Solutions is creating irrigated city park benches made of condensed moss. The benches have the ability to absorb air pollutants and use installed fans to create large area-covering air flow. In 2018, Goodyear released a tire design made with living moss that helps improve air quality as you drive.</p>
<p>Air pollution was the theme for the 2019 <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.worldenvironmentday.global/" target="_blank">World Environmental Day</a>, held on June 5. Thousands of people took to social media to show their support with the hashtag &nbsp;#BeatAirPollution and pledging to make lifestyle choices to support the fight for cleaner air. Officials from different countries made big announcements involving environmental issues such as Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, revealing a ban on single-use plastics in national parks. Other politicians who joined were Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s who pledged to phase out coal-use in Canada by 2030 and Chilean President Sebastian Piñera’s plan for Chile to go carbon neutral by the year 2050. UN Secretary-General António Guterres was quoted saying, “My message to governments is clear: tax pollution; end <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fossil-fuels">fossil fuel</a> subsidies; and stop building new coal plants. People everywhere are demanding action. On World Environment Day, let us heed their call.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/observation-tower/">observation tower</a> is comprised of three steel cube-like framed with open sides, creating a series of open-air platforms that rise up vertically from the ground. To get to the structure, a roped off trail leads from the hiking path.</p>

<p>A perforated split staircase leads visitors to the first level platform, which then rises up through the middle platform. There, a sunken courtyard provides a nice space for large groups. A fun cat ladder leads up to the top of the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/observation-tower/">observation deck</a>, allowing for prime views of the lush tropical landscape.</p>

<p>The multiple platforms were all purposely laid out in tight configurations, and at differing heights, creating private reading or contemplation spaces, open terraces, as well as <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/courtyard/">courtyards,</a> reading areas, a meditation room, etc.</p>

<p>Additionally, the tower&#8217;s platforms are made out of perforated panels so that the forest <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/nature-inspired-design/">trees and vines</a> can grow unobstructed through the slats over time.</p>
<p><a href="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Natures-Catalog7.jpg"><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/steel-framed-treehouse-slated-for-malaysian-national-park/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Natures-Cataloglede-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="aligncenter size-resp_homebig wp-image-2215680" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Natures-Catalog7-889x592.jpg" alt="women sitting on open platform surrounded by jungle"></a></p>
<p>Due to the natural, remote location, all of the building materials, which are minimal apart from the steel frames themselves, will be delivered by hand and assembled on site in order to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/low-impact-design/">reduce impact</a> on the existing landscape.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the heart of Poznań, Poland, artist Alicja Biała and architect Iwo Borkowicz have installed <a href="http://www.totemy.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Totemy</a>, a series of giant sculptures designed to raise awareness about climate change and environmental issues. Located beneath the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/mvrdv/">MVRDV</a>-design Baltyk building, the massive totems derive their bold patterns, vibrant colors and shapes from statistics on pressing environmental topics, from deforestation to air pollution to plastic production.

<p>Measuring nearly 30 feet tall in height, each timber Totemy sculpture was constructed and painted by hand by Biała with help from local wood workers and community members. During the design process, Biała opened her workshop to the public for weekly open studios where the community could contribute their ideas to the project. Given the amount of community involvement, the sculpture location beneath the Baltyk building was fitting: the building, which was <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/adaptive-reuse">formerly a cinema</a>, had long served as a place where people would gather to discuss political ideas. </p>

<p>“The two designers aimed to use <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/public-space">public space</a> as a direct confrontation with facts and statistics, able to reach a wider public than would typically be afforded by museums, galleries and conventional art spaces,” the Totemy press release noted. </p>

<p>“We wanted to address the public at large and at an everyday level,” Biała explained. “Passersby on the street and tram will catch out of the corner of their eye a flash of strong colors and be reminded of the current state of our world.”</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/giant-totems-in-poland-warn-against-climate-change-catastrophe/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Totemy-by-Alicja-Biala-and-Iwo-Borkowicz-1-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Totemy-by-Alicja-Biala-and-Iwo-Borkowicz-6-889x635.jpg" alt="colorful totem poles" class="wp-image-2216057" /></p>
<p>The popularity of the Totemy project in Poland has garnered interest in other cities and abroad. Biała and Borkowicz plan to take the concept to other countries to spur dialogue about <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change-art/">climate change</a> and environmental issues.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you live in the central or eastern U.S., it&#8217;s time to fill your ice trays and seek shade as a major heat wave will put 50 million Americans under a heat warning this week.</p>
<p>People in Nashville, Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia, New York, Washington, D.C. and many other cities will be fanning themselves as temperatures top 95 degrees. High humidity will intensify the effect. &#8220;The prolonged duration of the heat and humidity will potentially become dangerous to those most vulnerable,&#8221; the National Weather Service warned. The heat wave will probably last at least three days.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/heatwave-roasts-mussels-alive-in-california/">Related: Heatwave roasts mussels alive in California </a></p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate">Climate </a>scientists predict that by the mid-21st century, Americans will face an average of 36 days annually when the heat index surpasses 100 degrees, and 24 days when it exceeds 105. By 2100, those numbers could rise to 54 and 40.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our analysis shows a hotter future that&#8217;s hard to imagine today,&#8221; said UCS senior climate scientist Kristina Dahl, according to <em><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/climate-change-millions-people-u-s-extreme-heat-1449512" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Newsweek (opens in a new tab)">Newsweek</a>.</em></p>
<p>In addition to direct health risks of scorching <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/weather">weather</a>, heat waves bring other dangers and inconveniences to cities. More people cranking air conditioners lead to power fails. Places like Manhattan— which is served by underground delivery systems that heat up as the ground gets hot— are especially susceptible to blackouts. </p>
<p>Scientists predict that the current heat wave will bring record high overnight lows in many cities, and that this pattern will also continue to rise with climate change. This phenomenon presents a serious <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/health">health </a>risk, as people’s bodies don’t have a chance to cool overnight.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When charged with creating a new family home just steps away from Singapore&#8217;s Botanic Gardens, the Singapore and U.K.-based firm <a href="https://guzarchitects.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Guz Architects</a> was compelled to use the amazingly lush surroundings as inspiration for the design. Located on top of a hill overlooking the incredible gardens, the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-power/">solar-powered</a> Botanica House boasts an open layout heavily influenced by a soothing combination of Feng Shui and sustainability.</p>

<p>Spanning more than 14,000 square feet, the Botanica House manages to blend into its idyllic setting through the use of local building techniques that include <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/nature-inspired-design/">natural materials</a>, as well as the use of clean energy via solar panels installed on the roof. Perched on top of a hill overlooking the botanical gardens, the home is comprised of three levels with large cantilevers that give the structure the appearance of &#8220;floating&#8221; over the hilltop.</p>

<p>The home&#8217;s entryway is marked by a landscaped pond and waterfall that lead up to the front door. Following a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/courtyard/">sunken courtyard</a>, the interior space features several connections to the outdoor areas.</p>

<p>Although the natural setting and nearby gardens drove the design, the beautiful home was also based on various principles of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/feng-shui/">Feng Shui</a>, such as the round lift and angling of the front door. Water also plays a strong role with a soothing river-like pool that wraps around the exterior and winds its way through the interior.</p>

<p>The home has a strong connection to the natural setting thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding doors that lead out to the outdoor spaces. Throughout the home, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-light/">natural light</a> is also diffused through various skylights.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reusable menstrual cups have been around for decades, but they are just starting to pick up in popularity. Most people can’t shake their familiar comfort with tampons and pads, but a new study indicates that the cup is just as effective as the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/single-use">disposables</a> and has no health risks. If you can get past the learning curve and &#8220;ick&#8221; factor, the menstrual cup is one of the easiest and most sustainable options for your period.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/reuse">Reusable</a> cups are typically made from silicone or rubber and are inserted into the vagina. The cup stays put via suction against the vaginal walls. A finger must be inserted to break the suction, and then the user removes the cup, empties its contents, washes it and reinserts it. It can stay for up to 12 hours. The initial cost of cups might seem expensive, around $40 USD, but they last up to 10 years.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(19)30111-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">study</a> in <em>The Lancet Public Health</em> used data from more than 3,000 people around the world and proved that the cup is safe and effective. Not only are there no associated health risks, including vaginal infection or discharge, but the cups are light, compact and easy to travel with. Once you get past the initial sticker price, cups are one of the most affordable options and could be helpful for people in poor and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/rural">rural</a> communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;People in non-profits assume that [the cups are] not suitable,&#8221; said Mandu Reid, founder of <a href="https://www.thecupeffect.org/in-low-income-countries/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Cup Effect</a>, which trains people how to use cup. &#8220;That&#8217;s based on presumptions about these women&#8217;s preferences. That they wouldn&#8217;t like them because they have to be inserted or because they don&#8217;t want to touch their own menstrual blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is certainly an &#8220;ick&#8221; factor to get past and some challenges in areas with limited access to clean <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/water">water</a>; however, the study found that 73 percent of first-time users expressed a willingness to continue using it.</p>

<p>“The project deals with the idea of blurring the boundaries between inside and outside, such that the building becomes one with nature,” Cadence Architects said. “The challenge in this project was to insert built forms into the existing landscape and blurring the edge seamlessly like a graft. The landscape is treated as a visual and tactile element. The built form responds to both the immediate site context as well as to that of the hill station. The surfaces of the buildings are rendered with earthy and rustic materials to accentuate their contemporary forms. <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/local-materials/">Local materials</a> available on site are extensively used to not only help the architecture blend with the context but also make the project sustainable.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Companies around the globe looking for ways to battle plastic waste are coming up with innovative ways to tackle the issue. Cape Clasp, based out of Falmouth, Massachusetts, is an example of a business putting the health of the ocean front and center with the release of Tikós— a line of bracelets made from recycled <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a>. </p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/tikos-cuffs-aim-to-break-the-plastic-waste-circle/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/bannerTikos01-889x273.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Tikos01-889x592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2216856"/></p>
<p>While each bracelet, or cuff, represents 100 plastic bottles removed from the ocean, the message goes well beyond simply <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/recycle">recycling </a>plastic. The leaders at Cape Clasp believe that education is a more powerful tool than recycling. After all, the only way we will ever solve the massive single-use plastic problem is to change the habits of those causing the issue in the first place.</p>

<p>“Creating a new market for ocean plastic will drive its removal, but that won’t be enough to protect <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/marine-life">marine life</a>,” says Patrick Clarke, founder of Cape Clasp. “No matter how much plastic we remove from the water, there will always be more flowing in unless we change our habits.”</p>
<p>So while the company turns post-consumer plastic into products, diverting that waste from <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/landfill">landfills</a>, their mission is to change the behaviors that produce the plastic waste currently endangering marine animals. With that in mind, each cuff stands as a reminder to the wearer. Color coded to represent different challenges, consumers can choose one or collect them all.  </p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/tikos-cuffs-aim-to-break-the-plastic-waste-circle/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/bannerTikos01-889x273.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Tikos04-889x592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2216858"/></p>
<p><strong>Blue</strong>: “Bring a Bag” reminds consumers to tote your own reusable shopping bag to help <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/conservation">conserve </a>natural resources like petroleum (plastic) and trees (paper), plus eliminate the plastic bags tumbling down the coastline. <strong>Black</strong>: “Skip the Straw” by either asking your server to hold it when you order or by bringing your own reusable straw. Plastic straws are one of the top waste materials clogging beaches and endangering ocean <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/wildlife">wildlife</a>. <strong>Teal</strong>: “Keep the Cup” your morning coffee comes in and find a way to reuse it. Better yet, bring your own cup in for refills and skip the single use altogether. <strong>Tan</strong>: “Clean the Coast” with every trip to the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/beach">beach</a>. Bring along a garbage bag and pick up debris as you stroll, or think big and organize a beach clean up event.</p>

<p>With a purpose-driven mission to clean up the ocean and protect the animals, Cape Clasp has joined forces with myriad similar-minded organizations to further their goal. Donating 15 percent of their profits, the company has raised over $35,000 in the past two years, which has helped fund partners working to protect the dolphins, whales, sea turtles, sharks and the Cape Cod coastline.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When asked to renovate and expand a home on a challenging triangular lot in Sydney, local architectural practice <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.studioplusthree.com" target="_blank">studioplusthree</a> decided to build upward to make the most of the awkward site. By elevating the home’s new addition into the canopy of a large existing fig tree, the architects maximized access to natural light and city views while taking advantage of the tree’s shade. Dubbed the Platform House after its &#8220;new living platform,&#8221; the updated house also boasts increased energy efficiency thanks to the use of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/passive-solar">passive solar</a> strategies as well as the installation of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-power">solar hot water panels</a> and a rainwater collection system.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/passive-solar-home-makes-the-most-of-a-difficult-triangular-site-in-sydney/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/platform-house-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/platform-house-4-889x691.jpg" alt="white house with black geometric upper floor extension" class="wp-image-2215349" /></p>
<p>Completed over the span of 36 months on a tight budget, the Platform House has been enlarged to cover an area of 2,131 square feet with a 753-square-foot basement. The existing ground floor was retained but reconfigured to house four bedrooms, a sitting room and an outdoor courtyard, while most of the attention was given to the new elevated extension. In contrast to the all-white ground floor volume, the new “platform” is clad in blackened timber and cantilevers out to provide shelter to the courtyard below.</p>

<p>“Responding to the triangular site, the diagonal cut of the first floor volume is manifested in elements throughout from window reveals to planter boxes and outdoor seating,” the architects explained in the press release. “Acting as both cladding and screen, the upstairs volume is wrapped in a charred <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/cypress">cypress</a>, all of which was undertaken by hand, on-site. The design aims to integrate functionality into the details to enrich family living — such as the northern edge of the elevated deck, expressed in a continuous element that incorporates planting, outdoor seating, privacy screen, benchtop and storage.”</p>

<p>For added privacy, the new living platform is partially sheathed in a series of sliding perforated bronze screens that protect against <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-heat-gain">solar heat gain</a> yet still let in natural light when closed. Deep eaves and recessed blinds shelter glass openings, while the fig tree provides additional protection against the western sun. The open-plan living spaces also open up to a north-facing outdoor terrace.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has re-approved a pesticide for use throughout the country despite its known toxicity to honeybee populations. The <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/toxic-chemicals">chemical</a>, sulfoxaflor, is produced by DowDupont, a major chemical company that contributed $1 million to President Trump’s campaign. </p>
<p>Sulfoxaflor was originally approved for use by the EPA in 2013, but the approval was adamantly opposed and challenged by beekeepers and environmentalists. In 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/EPA">EPA </a>to discontinue the chemical’s approval since DowDupont could not provide enough evidence proving their product is <em>not</em> harmful to bee populations. Despite this ruling, the government continued to offer “emergency approvals” of its use and now has officially re-approved its use on over 190 million acres of crops. Their product is now approved for use on corn, strawberries, citrus, pumpkins, pineapples and soybeans. </p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/native-bees-are-going-extinct-without-much-buzz/">Related: Native bees are going extinct without much buzz </a></p>
<p>Although the EPA’s <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2010-0889-0566">own studies</a> provide evidence that the substance is “highly toxic to honeybees at all life stages” and similarly toxic to native bee populations, the EPA announced it was thrilled to lift the ban on such a highly effective <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/agriculture">agricultural </a>product. </p>
<p> “Scientists have long said pesticides like sulfoxaflor are the cause of the unprecedented colony collapse. Letting sulfoxaflor back on the market is dangerous for our food system, economy and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environment">environment,</a>” says a legal representative from Earthjustice.</p>
<p>Both honey <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/bees">bees</a> and native bees have seen a rapid decline in their numbers over the past few decades. This winter, beekeepers reportedly lost over 35 percent of their colonies. Since 1947, the population of honeybees has dropped from 6 million to under 2.4 million.</p>
<p>“The Trump EPA’s reckless approval of this bee-killing <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pesticide">pesticide </a>across 200 million acres of crops like strawberries and watermelon without any public process is a terrible blow to imperiled pollinators,” says the director of the Center for Biological Diversity.</p>

Across the aisle, the compact bathroom features a shower with a removable showerhead and a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/composting-toilet/">composting toilet</a> along with a small skylight.</p>

<p>Of course, no adventure vehicle would be complete without storage for equipment. The back of the Christopher features a gear garage with enough space for two bicycles, snowboards, fishing gear, crash mats and more. A rooftop rack offers extra space for larger pieces, such as kayaks. The space also holds the 91-liter fresh and gray water tanks so that the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/rv/">converted RV</a> is adventure-ready at every moment.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The alternative protein industry is booming and even predicted to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/vegan-and-lab-grown-meats-predicted-to-take-over-meat-market-in-20-years/">take over the animal-based meat market</a> in the next two decades. Leading plant-based protein brand Impossible Foods recently announced it is experimenting with a fish-less seafood product and expects it to be on shelves soon.</p>
<p>The company is best known for patties made from heme-based protein that have surged in popularity and are even available on the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/burger-king-unveils-the-plant-based-impossible-whopper/">Burger King</a> and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/white-castle-is-now-offering-bleeding-vegan-impossible-burger-sliders/">White Castle</a> menus. Impossible Foods is currently experimenting with using alternative and lab-grown proteins that can be genetically modified to have a seafood-like taste and texture thanks to the heme. Heme is made from fermenting a genetically modified yeast and then injecting it with genetic material from soy plants.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/cell-based-meat-could-replicate-and-replace-shrimp-lobster-and-crab/">Related: Cell-based meat could replicate and replace shrimp, lobster and crab</a></p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plant-based">heme protein</a> is the most successful because of its seafood-like flavor. Impossible Foods used it to make a broth that tasted like anchovies and was part of a paella recipe. Apparently, the results were excellent.</p>
<p>The company’s mission is to eliminate <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/meat">meat</a> from diets in order to save the environment from the devastating meat industry. Agriculture is responsible for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="nofollow noopener">9 percent of all greenhouse gases</a>, and 4 percent of that is directly from livestock. Impossible Foods&#8217; plan is to have a replacement or alternative protein for every animal-based meat option available by 2035.</p>
<p>Impossible Foods is not the first to experiment with a fish-less <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/seafood">seafood</a> product. In fact, Good Catch already has an alternative tuna product in Whole Foods, Wild Type has a salmon product grown in labs and Gardein offers fish-less filets at retailers like Kroger and Target. </p>
<p>“The only way we can succeed is to make fish from plants that is more delicious than the fish that’s strip mined from the ocean,” Pat Brown, chief executive of Impossible Foods, said, highlighting the devastating impact that overfishing has on ocean ecosystems and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fisheries">fisheries</a>. The United Nations estimates that <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://sustainablefisheries-uw.org/fact-check/how-many-fisheries-are-overfished">60 percent</a> of the worlds fisheries are overfished.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To those of us who concentrate on sustainability and green options for travel, electromobility appears to be a godsend — but the increasingly popular electromobility lifestyle still holds good and bad traits. Thankfully, as the market continues to grow, electric vehicles such as e-bikes and scooters only continue to improve since they were first introduced, and electric cars continue to get more and more sophisticated and efficient each year. While there are obvious benefits to using or even owning one of these trendy vehicles, the electromobility industry still has some kinks to work out. Here are the pros and cons to consider before embracing electromobility.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-electromobility/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/electromobility-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/electromobility-2-889x592.jpg" alt="person riding electric one-wheel scooter" class="wp-image-2215948" /></p>
<p><h2>Pro: less utilization of fossil fuels</h2>
</p>
<p>Though the extraction of different kinds of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fossil-fuels">fossil fuels</a> (coal, oil, natural gas) present <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/hidden-cost-of-fossils" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">different levels and types of impact</a> on the environment, they all have one thing in common: emitting harmful pollutants and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when burned. These pollutants can include sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that contribute to acid rain, smog and soot.</p>
<p>While the burning of fossil fuels poses serious issues, it doesn’t stop there. The only ways to extract these fossil fuels from the Earth is by mining or drilling, and both have the potential to generate significant air and water <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pollution">pollution</a>, inflict serious health issues to workers or the local community and alter ecosystems. Offshore drilling poses risks of oil spills that can absolutely devastate ocean life.</p>
<p>As the transportation sector as a whole relies almost exclusively on fossil fuels, it is responsible for a majority of the hidden environmental costs that the fossil fuel industry implements on the Earth. According to the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/reducing-pollution-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</a>, “In general, EVs produce fewer emissions that contribute to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change">climate change</a> and smog than conventional vehicles &#8230; EVs typically produce fewer life cycle emissions [emissions from vehicles over the course of its life from production to disposal] than conventional vehicles, because most emissions are lower for electricity generation than burning gasoline or diesel.”</p>
<p><h2>Con: batteries</h2>
</p>
<p>Replacing harmful fossil fuels with electric vehicle <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/batteries">batteries</a> comes at a cost. Producing these large lithium batteries requires natural resources from lithium and nickel mines, which can emit pollutants such as sulfur dioxide into the air and pose health risks to workers. Most batteries, especially in smaller EVs like scooters and e-bikes, have a limited lifespan. After disposal, batteries can end up in landfills to release toxins into the environment or in the ocean to harm sea life.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/we-love-electric-scooters-but-is-the-bird-trend-actually-bad-for-the-environment/">Related: We love electric scooters — but is the Bird trend actually bad for the environment?</a></p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-electromobility/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/electromobility-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/electromobility-3-889x592.jpg" alt="electric scooters parked on a sidewalk" class="wp-image-2215949" /></p>
<p><h2>Pro: improved air quality</h2>
</p>
<p>The potential to dramatically improve <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/air-quality">air quality</a> is arguably the biggest draw for electromobility from an environmental perspective. The lack of exhaust systems in electric vehicles means less carbon dioxide emissions and less greenhouse gas buildup in our atmosphere.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/transport/what-we-do/electric-mobility/why-does-electric-mobility-matter" target="_blank">According to the U.N.</a>, air pollution causes 1 in 9 deaths around the world and, “Transport contributes approximately one quarter of all energy-related <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-dioxide-emissions">carbon dioxide emissions</a> to the atmosphere, which is set to reach one-third, growing faster than any other sector.” The majority of car growth in the world is expected to take place in developing countries, most of which don’t have any type of vehicle emissions standards or programs incentivizing low-emission transportation. U.N. Environment is working to sponsor 50 countries and cities around the world to introduce electric cars and electric methods of public transportation.</p>
<p><h2>Con: energy use</h2>
</p>
<p>Even though electric vehicles don’t emit as much carbon dioxide, the batteries still need to be recharged regularly. As the demand for electric modes of transportation grows, so does the need for <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/energy">energy</a> — and not all energy comes from renewable sources. For this reason, many owners of electric cars opt to install <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-power">solar panels</a> onto their homes to charge the vehicles from inside their garages at a much lower cost both financially and to the environment.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-electromobility/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/electromobility-lead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/electromobility-4-889x592.jpg" alt="charger connected to black electric car" class="wp-image-2215950" /></p>
<p><h2>Pro: decreased expenses</h2>
</p>
<p>Just the knowledge alone that their vehicle is better for the environment is enough for some consumers when it comes to purchasing an electric car, scooter or bike, but the reasons to make the investment into electromobility go far beyond peace of mind.</p>
<p>A 2018 study from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2018/01/14/electric-vehicles-cost-less-than-half-as-much-to-drive/#310d6c273f97" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">University of Michigan</a> revealed that in no U.S. state is it cheaper to use gasoline than electricity. Operating an <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/ev">EV</a> in the United States, according to the study, was $485 per year, while the cost for operating a gas-powered car was $1,117. That means on average, gasoline-powered vehicles cost twice as much as electric ones. Because EVs don’t require oil either, oil changes aren’t necessary, meaning maintenance time and cost is significantly reduced as well.</p>
<p>If all that still doesn’t convince you, some EV owners are eligible for a tax break as high as $7,500 depending on the individual tax situation and type of vehicle. The <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">EPA website</a> can help you estimate just how much money you could save by making the switch.</p>

<p>When the California Trail project was completed last July after 20-plus years in the making, the project doubled the size of the Oakland Zoo and added several new native <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/california">California</a> animal species including American buffalo, black bears, grizzly bears, mountain lions, jaguars, California condors and gray wolves. The 56-acre exhibit includes 26 structures and was carefully designed and constructed for minimal site impact. To further reduce landscape impact, the design team decided against developing roads and parking lots in favor of an aerial gondola that whisks visitors over the landscape to the start of the trail. </p>

<p>“We worked closely with PJA and the zoo to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/minimal-site-impact/">minimize impact</a> to the natural landscape, from the placement of the gondola that eliminates auto traffic to the careful siting of the boardwalk that preserves oak trees,&#8221; noted Janet Tam, principal in charge of the project. &#8220;The design intertwines animal habitats with human habitats; animals have their feeding grounds and night houses to retreat to, much like visitors enjoy the Landing Cafe for refreshment then stroll over to the Interpretive Center for quiet reflection.”</p>

<p>Visitors journey to different exhibitions via an 800-foot-long elevated <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/boardwalk">boardwalk</a>, which loops back around to the 20,150-square-foot Visitor and Interpretative complex that offers information about the history of the animals and the state of California. The California Trail also includes The Landing Cafe, an overnight campground and a playground designed to reflect the ecological zones of California. The buildings’ environmental impact is reduced even more with the use of solar power and rainwater harvesting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Designed by Brazilian firm <a href="http://www.pittaarquitetura.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PITTA Arquitetura</a>, the aptly named Casa Modelo serves as an architectural model for sustainable home design.

<p>Built for the owner of a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/sustainable-design/">sustainable</a> real estate development company, Casa Modelo is located in the remote area of Ubatuba. Surrounded by acres of lush, green, protected biospheres that span out to some of the country&#8217;s most beautiful beaches, the home has a setting that is as idyllic as it gets.</p>

<p>The incredible location set the tone for the design. Working with the homeowner, the architects sought to create a model sustainable home that could serve as a platform for future constructions in the area.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/brazilian-timber-home-uses-bioclimatic-principles-to-reduce-its-environmental-footprint/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Casa-Modelolead-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2216711" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Casa-Modelo181-889x592.jpg" alt="wooden home with deck overlooking forest"></p>

<p>At the forefront of the design was the objective of reducing the home&#8217;s impact on the pristine natural setting. Inserting the 1,100-square-foot building into the lot with <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/low-impact/">minimal interference</a> was essential to the project. Accordingly, the timber home is elevated off of the landscape by a concrete platform and pillars that allow natural vegetation to grow under and around the structure.</p>

<p>The local <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate">climate</a> is marked by severe humidity, ultra hot summers and considerable rainfall, all of which prompted the designers to create a resilient structure that could stand up to the extreme elements. Not only did elevating the home reduce its impact on the landscape, but it also helps keep ground humidity at bay and improves natural air circulation.</p>

<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/passive-design/">Passive, energy-saving features</a> are found throughout the home, namely in the structure&#8217;s large openings and high interior ceilings. The open-plan living area and kitchen open up to the outdoors thanks to a long stretch of sliding glass doors with retractable timber screens on either side of the house. The doors can be completely or partially left open to ensure cool temps and natural ventilation on the interior, a feature that also creates a strong, seamless connection with the outdoors.</p>

<p>The layout was also driven by the natural elements. The two bedrooms were orientated to embrace the morning <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-light/">sunlight</a>, while overhangs shade the living spaces from the hot summer sun. In the winter months, sunlight from the large, north-facing windows is absorbed by the concrete walls and floors during the day and released at night.</p>

<p>In addition to its impressive passive features, the home was installed with several systems to minimize energy use. A <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/solar-power/">solar array</a> covers 100 percent of the electrical needs, which are reduced thanks to highly efficient lighting, electrical equipment and smart home devices. Additionally, an innovative rainwater harvesting system provides water for the residents.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Major oil corporation Chevron spilled 800,000 gallons of crude oil and water into a dry creek in Southern California. While the spill is estimated to contain mostly water, experts estimate that between 240,000 and 265,000 gallons of crude oil were spilled— making it in the largest <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/oil-spill">oil spill</a> in California’s recent history.</p>
<p>The spill first occurred on May 10 and stopped immediately, however it began to seep again on June 8 and continued to spill into the creek until June 23. The head of California’s Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources first cited Chevron with a violation and asked them to stop extraction within that area, however, since the company did not act swiftly the head of the Division has now ordered the corporation to completely stop the spill and take measures to prevent such spills in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/airplanes-contrail-clouds-are-more-harmful-than-their-carbon-emissions/">Related: Airplanes’ contrail clouds are more harmful than their carbon emissions </a></p>
<p>The increased citation came on the head of the Division’s second day in the position, after his predecessor was fired by Governor Gavin Newson for issuing more <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/fracking">fracking</a> permits than the state typically awards.</p>
<p>Since the spill occurred in a dry creek in Kern County, it has caused as much damage as it would have in an active watershed. Therefore, the spill has been fairy contained with limited impact to surrounding <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/wildlife">wildlife</a>. The spill is close to Bakersfield, one of the state’s major agricultural areas.</p>
<p>“The Chevron spill clearly shows that California needs stronger climate leadership from the governor,” Greenpeace USA’s executive director said to local news KQED. “Oil and gas infrastructure will never be free from spills and leaks or from spewing <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-crisis">climate pollution</a>. We face a growing public health crisis and climate emergency stoked by rampant oil and gas development”</p>
<p>Company officials only began to clean up the spill on July 12 and casually reported that they would “review the order” from the state.</p>

<p>Built for a couple and their two children, the Cuckoo House spans an area of nearly 3,000 square feet across two floors and an attic. To make the most of its rectangular east-west plot, the architects split the ground floor into three sections: the entrance gate and parking pad on the east side along with a small storefront and bathrooms; the coffee shop and bar in the middle; and a semi-enclosed courtyard with a pool on the west side. Large arches surround the brick-paved courtyard and bring cooling breezes and views of the surrounding garden into the space, and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/full-height-glazing">full-height glazing</a> wraps the coffee shop to blur the line between indoors and out.</p>

<p>The residential section of the building is located atop the ground floor “base block” and split into three blocks: the double-story Block A with the master bedroom on one floor and the bathroom and walk-in closet on the other; the double-story Block B with the kids’ bedroom above and the living room below; and Block C that contains the kitchen and dining area. All three blocks are connected and open up to outdoor <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/terrace">terraces</a> with operable glazing and views.</p>

<p>“Like a habit, most of people’s daily activities usually take place in functional spaces. Tropical Space detaches walls, which are used to defined the place and offer the buffer space to urge people to leave their rooms and join together,” the architects explained. “These buffer layers can be used flexibly, connecting the indoor and the outdoor of the house, which could make the family activities be both private and open. Meanwhile, it allows the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/natural-ventilation">breeze</a> to go through all corners of the house, and make it chill in the tropical summer.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world’s digital obsession doesn’t come without a carbon footprint. By 2022, 60 percent of the world’s 7.5 billion people will have internet access and 80 percent of that internet use is for streaming videos. Data streaming now surpasses the aerospace industry in terms of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/carbon-emissions">carbon emissions</a>. So should we stop watching Netflix? One French think-tank seems to think so.</p>
<p>According to The Shift Project, until the world economy can realistically shift to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> in every country where the internet is used, people should consider limiting their video streaming. Its <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lean-ICT-Report_The-Shift-Project_2019.pdf">recent report</a> indicates that online video watching released 300 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in 2018 alone, about the same amount of annual emissions as the entire country of Spain.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/your-favorite-playlist-has-a-carbon-footprint/">Related: Your favorite playlist has a carbon footprint</a></p>
<p>“We have limited <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/energy">energy</a> resources. The internet is a worldwide thing, so it would require every country in the world to be powered by renewable energy,” said Maxime Efoui-Hess from The Shift Project. Because that goal is still far off, he also said we should not allow the internet to grow as fast as it has now — essentially advocating to limit internet access and global connectivity for poor and rural populations, which are among the last to access and readily use the internet.</p>
<p>Efoui-Hess also recommended slight changes like watching on smaller screens and not using high definition — changes that are insultingly small personal sacrifices and inconveniences while the top <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change">100 corporations</a> continue to emit more than 70 percent of the world’s <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gases</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re suffering from <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate">climate</a> anxiety and every small action makes you feel like you’re doing your part, by all means stop watching your favorite Netflix shows. But the best bet would be to continue advocating for major policy and economic changes that reduce the unchecked polluting and emissions among those companies and sectors in a position to make changes at a meaningful scale.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the second year in a row, design lab <a href="https://spacesaloon.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Space Saloon</a> has just wrapped up an exciting avant-garde art festival deep in the Southern Californian desert. Aimed to foster innovative design-build and hands-on education, the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/art-festival/">art festival</a>, named Fieldworks, is an experimental outdoor campus where young artists can learn new techniques and showcase their groundbreaking designs.</p>
<p><img fl:hint-main-image='true' data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/experimental-design-build-festival-takes-over-californian-desert/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Fieldworks-lede11-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2215622" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/FWProject_DOTS_Office-Kovacs-and-KMA_Photo-by-Zeno-Legner_Space-Saloon_03-889x592.jpg" alt="colorful platform elevated off the landscape"></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s festival took place within the expansive <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/desert/">desert landscape</a> in the San Bernardino mountains between Joshua Tree, Palm Springs and Los Angeles. According to Space Saloon, the desert was the perfect place to host the open-air campus thanks to the wide open landscape that offers virtually no physical limits.</p>

<p>Like the first year&#8217;s event, <em>Landing</em>, Fieldworks was a week-long program where teams of students and designers live and work together, collaborating on site-specific <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/art-installations">installations</a> that seek to question the relation between art and the environment.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/experimental-design-build-festival-takes-over-californian-desert/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Fieldworks-lede11-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2215626" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/FWProject_DOTS_Office-Kovacs-and-KMA_Photo-by-Zeno-Legner_Space-Saloon_01-889x666.jpg" alt="aerial view of white and pink platform"></p>
<p>Led by Office Kovacs + Kyle May, Architect and MILLIØNS (Zeina Koreitem and John May), Fieldworks allowed students to attend various workshops that focus on subjects that differ from traditional techniques and processes in an attempt to broaden the students&#8217; <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/art/">artistic horizons</a>. The workshops showcase a range of experimental material, from coding exercises and sound mapping to performances and interactive installations.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/experimental-design-build-festival-takes-over-californian-desert/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Fieldworks-lede11-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2215616" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/FieldworksWorkshop_Leah-Wulfman-and-Maxime-Lefebvre_GIF-by-Leah-Wulfman-and-Maxime-Lefebvre_Space-Saloon_04-889x501.jpg" alt="cactus with multiple colors"></p>
<p>Using these workshops as guidance, the students developed new art projects, which could include any number of formats, including performances, videos, interactive coded programs, sound installations or immersive objects.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/experimental-design-build-festival-takes-over-californian-desert/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Fieldworks-lede11-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2215611" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/FieldworksWorkshop_Alex-Braidwood_Photo-by-Zeno-Legner_Space-Saloon_02-889x500.jpg" alt="screen with the word code written on it"></p>
<p>One of the standout designs from this year&#8217;s event is DOTS, a pink and white framework with various connected platforms that could be used for an almost infinite number of interventions, especially as a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/shelter-design/">flexible, temporary shelter</a>.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/experimental-design-build-festival-takes-over-californian-desert/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Fieldworks-lede11-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2215624" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/FWProject_Gymnasium-1_MILLIONS_Photo-by-Zeno-Legner_Space-Saloon_02-889x666.jpg" alt="multicolored square platform with circular cutout"></p>
<p>Another innovative project is Gymnasium 1, an outdoor communal bathing facility made completely out of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/hempcrete">hempcrete</a> that aims to show that the carbon-negative material can be used in place of traditional concrete construction.</p>
<p><img data-pin-url='https://inhabitat.com/experimental-design-build-festival-takes-over-californian-desert/' data-pin-media='https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/Fieldworks-lede11-889x309.jpg' data-pin-id='' class="alignnone size-resp_homebig wp-image-2215618" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2019/07/FieldworksWorkshop_Rebecca-van-Beeck_Photo-by-Zeno-Legner_Space-Saloon_01-889x500.jpg" alt="woman wearing all white"></p>

			<description>New York-based Steven Holl Architects and Architecture Acts has won an international competition to design the new 1,300-seat concert hall in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Created as a “perfect acoustic instrument in its case,” the acoustics-driven design has a strikingly contemporary appearance with a rounded zinc-clad exterior that stands in dramatic contrast with the Ostrava Cultural Center, a modern classicism-style building that will be overlapped by the new concert hall.

<p>Slated to begin construction in 2022, the new building has a roughly teardrop-shaped form with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="concert hall (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/concert-hall/" target="_blank">concert hall</a> positioned at the rear to shield it from urban traffic noise.

The rounded facade is clad in zinc with a titanium oxide smog-eating coating and punctuated with <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/triple-glazed-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="triple-glazed windows (opens in a new tab)">triple-glazed windows</a> to prevent heat gains. The roof is topped with solar panels, while stormwater will be collected from the roofs of the Cultural Center and the new building and then treated and collected in a garden pond to create a cooling microclimate. </p>

<p>“The smooth case of zinc holds an “instrument” in an extended vineyard-type plan made of concrete and maple wood,” explain the architects in a press statement. “Czech composer, Leoš Janáček’s theories of time will guide and give order to the concert hall’s interior geometry. Acoustic wall panels are organized according to scasovani, or rhythm, in three variants: Znici = sounding; Scitaci = counting; and Scelovac = summing.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The president of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/tanzania">Tanzania</a> reported that since his election, the population of endangered rhinos has increased by 1000 percent. Following years of out-of-control poaching, President John Magufuli fulfilled his promise to crack down on wildlife trafficking and went so far as to use his own government security task force to arrest poachers.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s office stated that in 2015, there were only 15 surviving <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/rhinos">rhinos</a> left in the country. Within the first year as head of state, Magufuli had arrested major Chinese smugglers and sentenced them to 15 to 20 years in prison each. According to government reports, the arrests set a strong example to poaching gangs that regardless of status within the Chinese elite class, Magufuli meant business.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/ivory-queen-sentenced-to-15-years-for-illegal-ivory-smuggling/">Related: Ivory Queen sentenced to 15 years for illegal ivory smuggling</a></p>
<p>In addition to cracking down on <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/poachers">poachers</a>, the government has supported a park ranger program to collar and track elephants, which enables them to monitor and protect the species better. Four years later, the current rhino population is estimated to be about 167. Similarly, the elephant population is estimated to have risen 50 percent due to legal efforts against <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/endangered">endangered</a> wildlife crimes. </p>
<p>“As a result of the work of a special taskforce launched in 2016 to fight wildlife poaching, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/elephants">elephant</a> populations have increased from 43,330 to 60,000 presently,” an official from the Tanzanian government said.</p>
<p>Foreign conservationists are skeptical about the president’s claims, arguing that the majority of rhino newcomers are imported and the increase is not thanks to effective breeding or protection measures. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/cop/17/WorkingDocs/E-CoP17-68-A5.pdf" target="_blank">CITES also shows</a> that Tanzania had 133 rhinos four years ago, not 15 as the government has stated.</p>
<p>“This sounds like very good news, but we should view these figures with caution until there’s verification — there’s no way that has occurred through breeding and protection alone,” said Mark Jones, the policy lead at Born Free Foundation, a wildlife <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/charity">charity</a>.</p>
<p>According to environmentalists, the breeding and gestation period is too long for the population to have grown through natural biological processes in just four years. “They mature late, have long gestation periods and don’t produce many young,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Both species take a long time biologically to reproduce.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inspired by the concrete curves of legendary Spanish and Mexican architect Felix Candela, CO-LAB Design Office crafted a five-sided catenary structure that uses <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/bamboo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bamboo (opens in a new tab)">bamboo</a> sustainably grown in the neighboring Chiapas state. Flat sections of bamboo were bent on site, cold molded on the ground, then screwed and strapped together to create the arched beams. For structural stability, the architects wove the beams together with a structural triangular pattern along with two continuous layers of tightly woven bamboo lattice. Local zacate (straw thatch) was used as roofing to protect the structure from rain and heat gain. </p>

<p>“Luum Temple is a show case for sustainable development, it combines innovative design and engineering with artisanal building and organic sustainable materials,” explain the architects. “The arched vaults support each other, co-existing in structural dependency, serving as a reminder to the community of our interdependence and the accomplishments we can achieve when we work together.” The Luum Temple will be used to host “healing programs” such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="yoga (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/yoga-studio" target="_blank">yoga</a>, meditation workshops, and community gatherings.</p>

<p>CO-LAB Design Office also designed the master plan for the Luum Zama residential development. Unlike developers in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Tulum (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/tulum" target="_blank">Tulum</a> that clear cut existing jungle to maximize sellable land, Luum Zama has set aside half of its 8-hectare are for conservation of existing vegetation while also adding a reforestation program with endemic plants from the region. The architects hope that the project will help raise awareness for the urgency of conservation and regulation of construction in Tulum.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DoneGood, an e-commerce platform, is taking the ‘high road’ by offering exclusively <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/ethical">ethical</a> brands, but it isn’t above aiming to steal the loyalty of its competitor’s customers on the highly anticipated Amazon Prime Day. On July 15 and 16 — the same days that Amazon will offer major Prime discounts — <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://donegood.co/" target="_blank">DoneGood</a> is hosting “Better Days.” According to DoneGood representatives, using this site instead of Amazon is a no-brainer. The sales are “better than Prime Day — you get great deals and create &#8216;Better Days&#8217; for people and the planet.”</p>
<p>DoneGood is an e-commerce platform that only includes socially responsible brands that have been vetted and tagged for searchable categories like environmentally friendly, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/vegan">vegan</a> or women’s empowerment. The site conveniently knocks out hours of due diligence and research that well-intended customers have had to do in order to find eco-friendly brands that pay fair wages and treat workers with respect. The site contains hundreds of brands and a wide variety of projects, including sunglasses made from ocean <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic">plastic</a> and candles that give refugees a fair wage. </p>
<p>By contrast, workers at <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> have filed lawsuits for mistreatment, including long hours and limited water breaks. Some Amazon workers are planning a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/08/amazon-warehouse-workers-prime-day-strike">strike</a> during Amazon’s Prime Days.</p>
<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-online-versus-in-store-shopping/">Related: Carbon footprint breakdown: Pros and cons of online versus in-store shopping</a></p>
<p>DoneGood also offers a downloadable plugin that users can run simultaneously with their regular searches on Google, Amazon or other major retailer sites. The plugin will highlight the items within the user&#8217;s search that are approved as ethical, mission-driven items. </p>
<p>“The dollars we all spend are the world’s most powerful <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/corporate-responsibility">force for change</a>,&#8221;  Cullen Schwarz, founder of DoneGood, said. &#8220;Americans donated $400 billion to charity last year but spent $130 trillion buying stuff. If even a fraction of that spending is diverted to brands that are reducing poverty, protecting the environment, making the world better, the impact of that is huge.&#8221;</p>
