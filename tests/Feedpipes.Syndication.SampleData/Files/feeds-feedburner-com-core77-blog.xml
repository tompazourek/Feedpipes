This outlook is in one part thanks to Jackson's seemingly innate tendency to push back on outdated norms, in another part due to the ingenuity forced out of her after she woke up one day to find she was living with a neuromuscular condition. In fact, Jackson regularly gives credit to disabled people throughout history as "the original &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/opinion/disability-design-lifehacks.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;lifehackers&lt;/a&gt;". With this knowledge, it would make sense that the disabled community must mesh quite seamlessly with the design world... right? Well, Jackson and many other disability activists say, not quite. Jackson formed her organization The Disabled List to rectify this, not only to get more disabled voices in on the design conversation, but also to illuminate what the design community lacks without their input. At the Disabled List, Jackson and her team work to partner design studios with disabled designers who can help steer any project in the right direction and ensure disabled ingenuity is comprehensively applied to a design from the get-go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5ef964_4196" data-ic-marker="266442_1501"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950029_34481_89571_GWT8VFE8s.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d3f61_2123" data-ic-marker="50a353_964"&gt;We recently sat down with Jackson to learn more about how she entered the world of design and how she wants to spread the wisdom of the disabled community to improve the practice of design overall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a8c5ba_5198" data-ic-marker="b673ba_1192_t3"&gt;Core77: In your &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZhiu-jGbdE" target="_blank"&gt;AIGA talk&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;you said&amp;nbsp;you started your career in TV production. I was first off curious how you decided to go down that path and then what led you to going into design?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a7422a_1172" data-ic-marker="6adc75_5227"&gt;Liz: I grew up in Ohio. I watched a lot of TV, and I knew that Matt Lauer and [Yeardley Smith], the voice of Lisa Simpson, went to Ohio University, so I was like, "I'm going to go there." I studied TV production and I was no different than I am now. I almost failed out multiple times, but I remember this is sort of the embodiment of my entire college career. There was always this way in which I was pushing back. Before I graduated, I got an internship at the Ellen DeGeneres show. At the time, it was a brand new show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ee0950_222" data-ic-marker="f2fd01_2833"&gt;So, I went and it was just an exciting place to work. It was early on at the show, so it was a deeply moving time for everybody who was involved because, Telepictures and everybody involved with Telepictures didn't know if audiences were going to accept Ellen; it was still at that point. So, when ratings would come in, everybody was just so blown away and couldn't believe it. There were oftentimes tears of joy [for] that newfound success. So, I was there early on and then I came back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5bd4f8_181" data-ic-marker="8655ec_957"&gt;Four days after I graduated, I just decided I wanted to keep doing it. I moved back out to LA and eventually got a job there. I was there for a handful of seasons. Then I met my ex, followed her out to New York. Decided while working at Ellen that, daytime talk was going be my thing. So, I was like, "Okay, well I'm gonna do more of that." And for all the reasons that I succeeded at Ellen, I just totally failed at Martha [Stewart]. It was just awful and dramatic. And so, I decided I didn't want to work in TV anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7f2f8d_534" data-ic-marker="35074_2903"&gt;So I took a job at a startup called Airbnb. I think I might've been one of the first 50 employees, it was super early on. And then, I woke up sick one day and was pushed out onto disability and that's how this all started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="421222_1135_c"&gt;So how did that lead you to thinking about design?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="43c114_5426_c" data-ic-marker="67a71a_3306"&gt;When I got out of the hospital I needed eyeglasses and a cane. And for me the question was, why do I have so much choice with my eyeglasses when I don't with my cane? When I actually got home [from the hospital] and googled canes, I saw that there was no choice. I lost my shit. It was painful, and that was my first realization that, oftentimes disability means an inability to choose your own identity. Your identity is sort of chosen for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b591ee_3955" data-ic-marker="31b419_2801"&gt;Then suddenly in my email one day, these canes showed up. There was a purple one, an orange one and a turquoise one. I just looked at the color purple, and I was just like, "That's it." I thought there was something sort of neutral about it. So, I got my cane, and a whole series of things happened. One was that I got on the subway one day and I went to sit down. I saw this woman looking me up and down. At that point, I thought she was going to ask me what was wrong, but instead she asked me where I got my cane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote id="8ed431_461_c"&gt;"Oftentimes disability means an inability to choose your own identity. Your identity is sort of chosen for you."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="271148_1576" data-ic-marker="25be63_5937"&gt;So I had my new purple cane, and I had gone into the J.Crew in Columbus Circle. In there was just this table of eyeglasses. That was the first time it really struck me—why doesn't J.Crew have a cane? It was especially striking to me because I realized, glasses are a two part process. You either wear the glasses without a prescription or you have to buy them at J.Crew and take them to your optometrist. It's a total pain in the ass. Why are they the thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ba7ed0_3169" data-ic-marker="925f01_2395"&gt;So I hauled ass home and wrote J.Crew customer service. I was like, "Will you sell a cane?" They wrote back and said, "No." And then, that weekend I was watching The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movies. That was when I realized I wanted a badass superhero alter ego. So, I created a blog called The Girl with the Purple Cane. And what I used it for initially was to harass J.Crew. I created this campaign called, "Yes J.Crew Cane". Through this process I had begun to start to build out an argument, find my way into the disability community and really start to learn about disability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="61000f_1760" data-ic-marker="db1b95_294"&gt;I later happened to meet this other person [when I attended the Nantucket Project], his name is [former RISD interim provost] Pradeep Sharma, and this was the moment that design [came into focus] for me. He was on stage making a series of assumptions. I start writing down everything that I think he got wrong. I was like, "you can't assume this. You can't assume this," right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="30aa7_3592" data-ic-marker="81cb2a_6943"&gt;So, I chased him down afterwards and I said, "You're wrong." He was like, "Tell me." I literally pulled a notebook and told him. He was like, "You're right. What do you know about design?" and I said, "Nothing." So he's like, "Why don't you start coming up? Stay with me and my family on weekends and we'll start to kinda cobble together some design education."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="412a06_802_c"&gt;Tell me about your organization&amp;nbsp;The Disabled List and the Critical Axis project.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="bf5974_3662_c_c" data-ic-marker="b0902e_7336"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.disabledlist.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The Disabled List&lt;/a&gt; is a disability-led design organization. We engage in disability as a creative practice. So, usually in design when people consider disability, typically the goal is to smooth things out or to fix a thing. But for me, it's really about honoring the friction of disability. Really thinking about what sort of creative opportunity disability has to bring to design. And really about actually incorporating design into disability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ea575f_4781" data-ic-marker="ba8ec_3013"&gt;And &lt;a href="http://www.criticalaxis.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Critical Axis&lt;/a&gt; is a project where we're actively putting a critical lens on what's lacking in design, marketing, branding and all these creative fields. So, what happens in [these fields] is if there's any sort of disability material, whether it's a product or campaign, it usually feels pretty good and people get caught up in their good feelings and it gets pushed through and it wins awards. It makes the paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5bff04_2149" data-ic-marker="c3fffd_1088"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="481" data-image-id="950030" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950030_34481_89571_FRUgjNuCb.png"&gt;&lt;em id="41c5a2_2868" class="caption"&gt;Disability tropes as charted on &lt;a href="http://www.criticalaxis.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Critical Axis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f4cbb2_313" data-ic-marker="250a1b_668"&gt;And what I wanted to do was take the tropes that we had studied within disability studies and the awards that these ads are being given, smash them together and see what happens. And, it's just been horrifying. There are these things that I didn't expect to bump into. One of the big ones is where companies will announce something, get the PR boost, and either the thing never happens or it stays up for a few months and then it just goes away. I didn't realize how much this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote id="1d6588_4134_c"&gt;"Usually in design when people consider disability, typically the goal is to smooth things out or to fix a thing. But for me, it's really about honoring the friction of disability. Really thinking about what sort of creative opportunity disability has to bring to design."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9cee40_3422" data-ic-marker="d9b37e_2068"&gt;It's an overwhelming amount of examples. And again, I think it's because when people endeavor in this space, they get caught up in their good intentions and they don't realize the amount of work it takes. That there's maintenance. I think that's the thing that's lacking, is maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="65d46e_2543_c"&gt;So it's about&amp;nbsp;not only&amp;nbsp;helping people&amp;nbsp;be aware of these tropes and calling them out, but also keeping people accountable for what they've said they were going to do.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="64a8e1_1473" data-ic-marker="33b499_7438"&gt;Yes. But the thing that I really struggle with is, this work is just so incredibly painful. It's horrible because, what do I have? I have smiling faces approaching me telling me about this good thing they did, and then I burst their bubble, right? Every time. So, I think there is this element with Critical Axis where I hope that because it exists out in the world, if people will just use it as a resource, maybe I won't have to do the work and it is able to do the work for me and my peers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5ebf30_2106_c"&gt;I imagine&amp;nbsp;there are tons of disabled designers out there, but for whatever reason there's&amp;nbsp;low visibility around the work that they're doing. Why is that?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a6580f_4525" data-ic-marker="52cbfd_5731"&gt;So, when I started the &lt;a href="https://www.disabledlist.org/with/" target="_blank"&gt;WITH fellowship&lt;/a&gt;, somebody at SCAD reached out to me. And they said, "Do you want our disability numbers?" I was like, "Sure." These numbers come from one specific place, which is that these are not students who identify as disabled, these are students that requested accommodations. So, these numbers don't fully encompass the actual population of students that are disabled, but it's already a high number. There is something I know, which is this: on average, any college population is about 11% disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c921ee_1826" data-ic-marker="414d95_4077"&gt;So, I'm actually in the process of talking to all the different New York design schools, because I think that these numbers across the board might be this high everywhere. I wrote this piece in the Times about it—disabled people were the original life hackers, we spend our lives cultivating intuitive creativity because we're forced to navigate a world that's not built for our bodies, right? I think that creativity continuity that we spend our lives building, it leads us to enter design fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a987df_1341" data-ic-marker="a987df_1341_t3"&gt;You have to think about it this way though—say you know that disabled people are entering creative fields at education at a much higher rate. And then, just imagine to yourself what happens year after year. How these students probably graduate or drop out because they're not getting their needs met. And then, imagine what happens post graduation. When's the last time you worked with a disabled person? When's the last time you saw a disabled person in design? Where are these people? They disappear after graduation. I don't know the amount that's graduated, this is literally all I have to go on so far. But this is what I struggle with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a1fe2f_1183" data-ic-marker="7c1aa2_1421"&gt;There was a woman I talked to yesterday where she's creating this course about designing for disability. I'm like, "Why are you designing for disability when 20, 30, 40% of your students are probably disabled?" So, there's the disabled student who clearly is not doing so hot, even though they're entering these fields at exponentially high rates. And then on the other side of this, you have the design student who has taken an interest in disability but doesn't have any resources or critical cultivated knowledge to pull from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="850ba1_3770" data-ic-marker="12cb18_5945"&gt;I realized if you start to incorporate disability studies curriculum into design school, what happens is you create a way for both of these students to engage in this space, but also in the process find each other. I fundamentally believe if you get these students working together in college, when they graduate, they're going to start their professional career actually seeing disabled people as their peers rather than recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a6430c_57_c"&gt;When you're talking about disabled studies, in your opinion&amp;nbsp;what is the right way of implementing this in design programs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="bb3899_1024" data-ic-marker="cfba9f_6802"&gt;I could list off the people that I think are top tier disability studies practitioners in design right now—you have Ashley Shew at Virginia Tech. You have Aimi Hamraie at Vanderbilt. You have Bess Williamson Stiles at SAIC. Elizabeth Guffey at SUNY Purchase. You have these people who are doing the work and honestly, what I really want is for design schools to work collaboratively with these people who have already been doing it. And start to realize that the expertise and the know-how already exists, it's just about applying it and making it accessible to whatever design school it is that you're working in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="823967_3068" data-ic-marker="7dfbee_2401"&gt;And the interest is there. I was approached by one New York City school, to teach a course on it, on Disability Studies and Design in the fall. I'm actually talking fairly comprehensively with another design school here in New York, about building a Disability Studies Minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2ea875_3935" data-ic-marker="52ee4d_6313"&gt;When these design schools are looking to do this, a question I encounter a lot is, who is the right disabled person to work with? For me what it comes down to is, is this person a disability studies practitioner? Have they actually worked with the literature? If a person can articulate that, then I think that is a person I would trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d7e6c2_1181_c"&gt;Do you think the designer's "problem solving" mentality can contribute to misguided solutions and the fact that&amp;nbsp;disabled people&amp;nbsp;are not included in the discussion?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="3ee198_2778" data-ic-marker="c88f45_972"&gt;I think for us at Disabled List, we actually think the problem is the defining of the problem. The actual problem-solution scenario is literally the problem, right? It's like the problem becomes the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote id="fc326f_5159_c"&gt;"I think that some of what we're teaching these younger designers is outdated. I think we need to kind of look for new models, ones that actually amplify people who are traditionally perceived as recipients. I think young designers are really looking for that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="972d7c_1975" data-ic-marker="69513c_5853"&gt;So, for us, in terms of our disability led design methodology, what Alex [Haagaard, Director of Communications at The Disabled List] has really come up with, is instead of defining a problem, how do you articulate a desire? And, how do you work from a framework of instead of defending the problem, what if the process is the problem and then just kind of going from there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="600863_2888" data-ic-marker="ab5fac_1328"&gt;This happens so often with design students is where I'll go on a stage and I'll rambunctiously talk about my perspective. And, I didn't realize early on that, in my doing that, I'm actually providing them with a sense of relief. Because I think, especially millennials as they start to enter design professions, they don't feel good in the role of "savior". It doesn't feel authentic to them. They are very conscious of all of the ways in which that can increase biases and create new stigmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="731ec2_1209" data-ic-marker="d94945_6372"&gt;So, I do think that some of what we're teaching these younger designers is outdated. I think we need to look for new models, ones that actually amplify people who are traditionally perceived as recipients. I think young designers are really looking for that. There's just, nothing has been created in that area yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c500d1_599_c"&gt;From your experience, what is&amp;nbsp;the secret sauce&amp;nbsp;to getting to people to let their guard down and actually listen? Because, that's a hard thing, especially now, to get people to do.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="91634e_1252" data-ic-marker="3ccad3_6277"&gt;Humor. I've also found, if I can acknowledge my mistakes ... I could look back at the things that I was thinking early on, I presume they're not different than what any designer right now would be thinking, right? It's sort of that working through the process. I told a story [in my AIGA talk] about, I encountered these flowers in a trash can, I thought they were thrown away, but it was actually public art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="70fbf8_2191" data-ic-marker="564c7d_3834"&gt;So, I think there is this way in which, if I can be self-deprecating about it, then I think it makes it easier for designers to take themselves a little less seriously. I think that within that scope of being neutral and being empathetic, I think we're also talking about being serious. So, just finding humor in it, I think is probably the easiest thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f39484_728_c"&gt;What would your advice be to anyone who wants to take an idea and not just turn it into an academic fascination, but actually into action?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="49fdee_3398" data-ic-marker="58fb63_5301"&gt;I'm going to reframe it a little bit—when a designer decides that they're going to work with a disabled person or they're going to design for a disabled person, they come in and the only interaction they have with the disabled person is simply around the solution the designer wants to create. What if instead you just began to find your way into a community and really start to understand the community without any sort of preconceived notions of what could be created, how you could benefit? But really, just simply out of a desire to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="67af9b_5090" data-ic-marker="b51244_6266"&gt;So, I think for me, even before we can frame a different future, I think we need to understand the people who would be a part of it. And then, go from there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="97da8b_320_c"&gt;Okay, my last question was, what can design publications like ours do better?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="981b3b_1043_c_c" data-ic-marker="41f70d_7383"&gt;Say you're a writer that doesn't have a budget or isn't making a lot of income right now. I would say, make friends with a disabled person that you can turn to, to ask just simple questions to. And, offer writers support in return and advocate internally whenever you can. If you're a company, I would have a disabled editor on call at all times. I wish that every publication had a disabled editor. I understand it's a tough thing to do given the state of media right now, there's just no money anywhere. But, just building those relationships and having that person on call. We know before we even read the article, we know from the picture, we know from the headline, we know from the first read. And, when I say we know, I think anybody else at whatever publication it is, couldn't even begin to consider the scope of all that we know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d8e9b5_3702" data-ic-marker="a64fd8_1608"&gt;And, I think this is the other thing too is, is writers really enjoy it. I think it'd be great if a publication supported relationships between disabled editors and writers, or hired disabled writers. Because we're fascinating to work with. We upend assumptions, we are really creative with language.

Part of that is guilt, because as an industrial designer I spent over a decade working on short-lived plastic objects. After seeing images of plastic-choked sea creatures on the news, I glumly realized that some of the stuff floating in the Pacific Garbage Patch features radii and fillets that I created on my work computer. I may not have killed any aquatic life myself, but my fingerprints were on the gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b216a_1025" data-ic-marker="99d2ae_3136"&gt;Living in the city, I tried to avoid plastic as much as possible by opting for things made of wood or metal. But once I moved to a farm, I found plastic unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6ed9be_1005" data-ic-marker="57b1cc_4632"&gt;Why? Because plastic is super useful, I'd say indispensable, on a farm. I've learned that plastic isn't the enemy--single-use plastic is the enemy. Plastic designed for daily use and durability is a godsend. It doesn't rust. It can be scrubbed clean. It's translucent, in liquid-storing applications where you need to see how much is left. Designed properly, it's both strong and tough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="dee04a_275" data-ic-marker="c3fda7_1609"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950308" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950308_81_89658_uIOnOVbCs.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b109f5_3466" data-ic-marker="8af3b4_2194"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950310" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950310_81_89658_tnA6bARLf.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="35462b_1187" data-ic-marker="b4ca24_785"&gt;Most importantly of all, plastic is a lot easier to work with than metal in some applications, like the most recent one in which plastic was my savior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5d9a22_1112" data-ic-marker="a59782_2933"&gt;My wife and I live on a bird farm. We have roughly 200 free-range birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="324a54_4298" data-ic-marker="1fd0fc_4511"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950314" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950314_81_89658_CVip7ufEI.jpg" style="font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b2d0ff_1310" data-ic-marker="214266_5569"&gt;These are my two dogs, the main problem in this entry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3bcf53_7598" data-ic-marker="94ca74_1772"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="42757_2164" data-ic-marker="13b065_3588"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950312_81_89658_yw27W0cEe.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="50aa29_3467" data-ic-marker="181ecc_5293"&gt;They're Shibas, a breed that's misregarded as cute and harmless because of internet memes; in fact they're natural-born killers, one of the breeds genetically the closest to wolves. Given the chance, they will attack and eat small animals. I watched Betsy pin a bird down with her front paws, then use her teeth to pull the poor thing's head off, like she was trying to stretch out a sock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="78c6aa_712" data-ic-marker="225fb6_1657"&gt;For that reason I keep the dogs enclosed within a massive dog run composed of 300 linear feet of five-foot-tall welded wire fence, supported by concrete-anchored pressure-treated 4x4s dug below the frost line. The raw materials alone cost about a thousand bucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fb09ec_4850" data-ic-marker="40d5ab_2441"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950316" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950316_81_89658_9T6uG83IV.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ef0acc_5456" data-ic-marker="d9dd1f_3660"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950318" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950318_81_89658_o0GQSwuQB.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ff6f3a_1191" data-ic-marker="2109c2_1593"&gt;Chickens cannot fit through the welded wire of the fence, which exponentially increases their lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="76ee9d_1532" data-ic-marker="1cba98_4979"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950324" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950324_81_89658_Ns3qRyKpT.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8327ca_616" data-ic-marker="2308bd_357"&gt;However, here is a guinea fowl chick recently born on our farm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="84b790_2439" data-ic-marker="e4e682_2531"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950320" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950320_81_89658_j0i323gq8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="608a56_990" data-ic-marker="79ef5c_3780"&gt;They're tiny. And unfortunately, I recently learned, they have no problem squeezing right through the 2"x3" welded wire fence holes to the dog run. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="317bf9_590" data-ic-marker="ea693d_6013"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="76675a_8090" data-ic-marker="111e83_3822"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950321_81_89658_WVBXsOlIm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7dab42_3987" data-ic-marker="163553_3129"&gt;Recently just one guinea fowl hatched 17 chicks, and I had a real problem keeping the little maniacs out of the dog run. This was during that week where it was 110 degrees. I needed to patch all 300 feet of the fence, and fast, because spending long stretches in that heat doesn't go well with my constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b659e8_820" data-ic-marker="7fcd3c_5492"&gt;The obvious answer would be chicken wire, as its tiny hexagonal apertures are too small for chicks to get through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d2a8e5_499" data-ic-marker="2595d5_342"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c4ee2d_681" data-ic-marker="9cf9ec_1716"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950328_81_89658_cFIN_cD3x.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="839cb1_399" data-ic-marker="fd005c_3082"&gt;Have you ever worked with chicken wire? It's an &lt;i&gt;incredible&lt;/i&gt; pain in the ass. It arrives in tightly-wound rolls and has the memory of an elephant, stubbornly refusing straightening. The exposed wire edges are razor-sharp, and trying to manipulate the material into place is like fighting a gang of needle-wielding octopuses. It comes wrapped in fine metal wire, which most farmers save and use to weave sections together one hexagon at a time, an incredibly time-consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5fd41e_2718" data-ic-marker="429da7_5164"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950326" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950326_81_89658_VTSWDkB39.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="949c0e_109" data-ic-marker="4165a9_4721"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="1173" data-image-id="950330" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950330_81_89658_yzqoTbyjG.jpg" style="font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e8f89_768" data-ic-marker="a88257_5699"&gt;Plastic to the rescue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ec24ca_659" data-ic-marker="d80087_1131"&gt;This is extruded poultry fencing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="40645a_5318" data-ic-marker="51af81_6191"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950335_81_89658_UQtTKM66T.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1dce58_6766" data-ic-marker="47a7fd_3562"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950333" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950333_81_89658_B7sRWEcQ3.jpg" style="font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d3f630_1614" data-ic-marker="5f04d6_5684"&gt;Same idea as chicken wire, but it's plastic. A 25-foot-long, 3-feet-tall roll can be cut in half, with the ease of cutting paper with scissors, and now you've got 50 feet. It's pliable, reasonably obedient, and the exposed edges aren't sharp enough to cut you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fdc559_1671" data-ic-marker="88c3bf_1002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d8431c_133" data-ic-marker="d12173_4392"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950332_81_89658_SUwpsDIPG.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7628a0_490" data-ic-marker="3d1db0_6219"&gt;Six rolls of this were enough to cover my entire dog run, in a fraction of the time it would have taken me to do with metal, and without the frustration and irritating micro-injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="17d8c6_3877" data-ic-marker="315509_1057"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950338" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950338_81_89658_WwIVziUOz.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="837195_2714" data-ic-marker="3e41a3_5262"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950342" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950342_81_89658_2ixyeatfm.jpg" style="font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d98732_1100" data-ic-marker="14037d_5739"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950343" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950343_81_89658_SpdJFd3Yv.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="43f097_2230" data-ic-marker="1b09d0_812"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="950347" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950347_81_89658_ZbTA3V5Yk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f4865_485" data-ic-marker="abbf05_7216"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="1173" data-image-id="950352" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950352_81_89658_4H9bKQWqc.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b46950_4968" data-ic-marker="f86264_5706"&gt;I affixed it to the existing fence using yet more plastic, roughly 800 zip ties in total. Again, this took a fraction of the time that it takes to cut and wind metal wire, then use pliers to tuck the sharp ends away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="53515b_1931" data-ic-marker="b8b426_4848"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950340_81_89658_QaBaqe7D9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3b751b_1761" data-ic-marker="a28c3a_2481"&gt;You might be wondering why I left the zip ties long.

Last time it took him six months to finish the zine after the campaign closed so this time around he's structuring things a bit differently. Every day of the campaign he draws one drawing and uploads the progress as a new version of his campaign video. After the full 24 days, he'll either have a 24-page zine or, if he falls behind, will cancel the project and refund backers.

The device looks like a thin Apple mouse and can be worn with a special shirt that has a discrete pocket for it at the base of the neck, where it uses the Peltier effect to either lower or raise your body temperature, depending on the season. Sony probably couldn't have timed the announcement better—as so many of us are struggling to stay comfortable, a personal air conditioner has never sounded more appealing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="40c357_2778"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2dlzdZlbq2Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="height: 371.25px; width: 660px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;em id="ebb991_1408" class="caption public_hide"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c205bc_1268" data-ic-marker="afe8e6_436"&gt;Reon pairs with—surprise, surprise—a mobile app that lets users control the temperature. Sony claims it can lower body temperature by 23 degrees Fahrenheit or raise it by 14 degrees. The design is pretty subtle, it weighs only three ounces and doesn't make any sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9221d3_1365" data-ic-marker="728b58_2024"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="616" data-image-height="347" data-image-id="950009" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950009_33852_89633_dEZxn4hxk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="72654a_7945" data-ic-marker="3c7ee6_1805"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="750" data-image-height="975" data-image-id="950010" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/950010_33852_89633_mMHxgrUFr.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="716f88_1051" data-ic-marker="935847_550"&gt;While initial reports touted a 24-hour battery life, Sony recently chimed in and let &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/28/sony-reon-pocket-wearable-air-conditioner/" target="_blank"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; know that the actual battery life will be a paltry two hours. That tiny detail, combined with the fact that you have to use it with a special shirt, certainly limits how users can take advantage of the device. But perhaps, as one &lt;a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/7/sony-wearable-air-conditioner-reon-pocket" target="_blank"&gt;commenter&lt;/a&gt; already pointed out, the more interesting thing about this product is thinking about it less like a cool new gadget and more as a "progression in how we view clothing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="40cdd7_871" data-ic-marker="21196d_560"&gt;None of the downsides have curbed enthusiasm for Reon. The product was crowdfunded in less than a week on &lt;a href="https://first-flight.sony.com/" target="_blank"&gt;First Flight&lt;/a&gt;, Sony's own accelerator platform that launched in 2015 to champion new projects by Sony employees. The release is planned for March 2020—just in time for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics—and the product will initially be available only in Japan, so the rest of us will likely be waiting even past next year's summer.  &lt;/p&gt;

To make the video even better, Formosa does some sketching to demonstrate how each object could be designed to improve on the original. &lt;i&gt;Bon appétit&lt;/i&gt;, designers! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="" id="4fcfe0_6847" data-ic-marker="2f17d7_8283"&gt;&lt;i&gt;How would you have redesigned one of the objects featured in the video?

Minnesota-based materials company 3M has just debuted a new type of packaging that claims to cut the time, materials, and space required to ship products by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9a33d_4892"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kS3lFumFrUI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="height: 371.25px; width: 660px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;em id="efedb3_804" class="caption public_hide"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b02dc_4592" data-ic-marker="6f02bf_2943"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.scotchbrand.com/3M/en_US/scotch-brand/tips-uses/flexandseal/" target="_blank"&gt;Flex &amp;amp; Seal Shipping Roll&lt;/a&gt; is made up of three plastics developed by 3M: a tear- and water-proof outer layer, a bubble-wrap cushioning middle layer, and an adhesive inner layer. The packaging option can be used on a variety of objects under three pounds, a category that, according to 3M, accounts for 60% of the items that are bought online. Users can simply cut what they need from the roll, fold the material over the object, and press down to seal—no need for tape. The adhesive only sticks to itself so there's no worry that it will stick to whatever you're packing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="76c784_4099" data-ic-marker="77a83e_1424"&gt;The process is a lot easier than the multi-step process of making a cardboard box and the resulting packages save a lot of space in delivery trucks. According to &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90382264/no-more-cardboard-boxes-3m-invents-an-ingenious-new-way-to-ship-products" target="_blank"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;, 3M is looking into large-scale retail partnerships with companies like Walmart and Target who are competing with Amazon's Prime delivery speeds. "Some of their business is automated [with robot-powered fulfillment centers], but some is done by hand," said business director Remi Kent. "We think we're a better solution for those items done by hand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a1c52_1334" data-ic-marker="da0f83_1964"&gt;The material can be recycled with other plastics, though 3M said it's looking into alternative materials that would make recycling even easier.  &lt;/p&gt;

Here they are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a3ce7_2650" data-ic-marker="412ddf_1175"&gt;____________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e2406d_642" data-ic-marker="307111_723"&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Smart Living: the factors shaping ambient technology in our future homes"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="dfb15_1051" data-ic-marker="e0c194_917"&gt;by Matthew Cockerill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ce2d0b_3335" data-ic-marker="37cab6_205"&gt;Our experience of our homes is changing as they become increasingly tech-enabled, from explicit interactions with screens to whole-room led interactions where technology is more observant, responsive and prescient to our needs. I recently hosted a panel discussion with researchers, designers and engineers from some of the world's leading brands, including Samsung, IKEA, Google ATAP (Advanced Technology and Products) and Nest, to discuss the opportunities and challenges of embedding more ambient technology into our future smart homes. Here are six key [takeaways] from that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bc8174_2573" data-ic-marker="ce8360_1355"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. The aesthetics of technology have become more complementary to our homes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8004ca_2091" data-ic-marker="25a348_789"&gt;When technology such as the radio and television first entered our homes, it took the guise of furniture. But Sung Bai, Head of industrial design at Nest, pointed out that over time, as brands wanted to showcase their tech more and stand out in the market, we ended up with shiny tech objects in our living spaces that eventually started to become obtrusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e26a5f_730" data-ic-marker="8e0f6c_871"&gt;We're seeing a reversal of this trend now as brands let technology visually recede into the fabric of our homes with products like the wireless speakers from Sonos, Libratone, Google and Amazon taking inspiration from home furnishings. Samsung have gone a step further in this regard with the 'ambient mode' on their OLED TV that matches the screen image to the interior wall colour and texture, eliminating the black rectangle in our home when it's on stand-by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b743ec_2635" data-ic-marker="ddcf00_1217"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3b4c2f_694" data-ic-marker="80df2b_1254"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949907_81_89614_tRXOpnPzA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;em id="faa90a_2202" class="caption"&gt;Samsung's "&lt;a href="https://www.core77.com/posts/74718/Samsungs-New-Invisible-Ambient-Mode-Feature-Shows-You-What-the-Design-of-a-TV-Should-Be" target="_blank"&gt;Ambient Mode&lt;/a&gt;" allows the screen to virtually disappear &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d9fb74_2851" data-ic-marker="be6112_806"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. A sense of agency will become increasingly important.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="450890_1547" data-ic-marker="a98572_339"&gt;Smart products can give us the potential for more control at home, but also take control away from us as they become more autonomous. There is an important balance to be made here. As Rick Marks, Director, Technical Project Lead at Google ATAP, put it, "one of the really interesting things about our home is it's where we have the most authority over what's going to happen." For this reason, products that increase our sense of agency and empower us to do more than we can currently do, rather than those that simply do everything for us, will feel more appropriate in our future homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e8f042_1710" data-ic-marker="e1157c_932"&gt;At the moment, we don't always have a sense of initiating, executing, and controlling technology. Marks, who spent 19 years at PlayStation before joining Google ATAP, believes that there are lessons to be learned from the video game world to help achieve a greater sense of agency. This includes creating a really well-defined interface of how to interact with our increasingly intelligent technology at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d7cbcb_4963" data-ic-marker="edc00e_336"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="800" data-image-height="400" data-image-id="949911" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949911_81_89614_sA8WQMt_x.gif" style="font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;&lt;em id="be8a1d_6760" class="caption"&gt;Google ATAP's &lt;a href="https://atap.google.com/soli/" target="_blank"&gt;Project Soli&lt;/a&gt; enables touchless gesture interactions &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="92e626_2876" data-ic-marker="243eee_1119"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. We should unlock new experiences, not just enhance existing ones.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a8405b_2185" data-ic-marker="2a3e76_1010"&gt;Ambient technologies have the potential to allow us to do completely new things in the home. But a lack of imagination often results in the transfer of existing screen-based digital products into new technology platforms. [However], things start to get interesting when we combine smart products. For example, smart doorbells (with one time access) and cameras in the home might eventually give us the confidence to accept services being carried out within our home without us being present, such as internet deliveries. New technologies like 8K resolution and 5G could open up the opportunity to deliver more intimate interactions in the comfort of our homes with, for example, healthcare professionals, beyond what we do now. Initially for convenience, ideas like these have the potential to open up radical new ways of using our time and our homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7e5c6e_2548" data-ic-marker="ba2752_516"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ed228c_309" data-ic-marker="598a5c_739"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949908_81_89614_8OExVt0ge.jpg"&gt;&lt;em id="ec91b3_1235" class="caption"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_hello_doorbell?hl=en-US" target="_blank"&gt;Nest Hello&lt;/a&gt; smart doorbell &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d38b7a_2352" data-ic-marker="f1238c_556"&gt;In turn, technology might change the very nature of our houses. Yasushi Kusume, Innovation &amp;amp; Creative Manager at IKEA, explained that they experimented with transforming the walls of our homes from barriers into filters that allow in the things we want, like sunlight and fresh air, and filter out what we don't, like pollutants and noise. While this idea requires a fundamental change to the architecture of our homes, a lot of the tech we need for this already exists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3b2cb6_945" data-ic-marker="9bd773_888"&gt;&lt;b id="e1e380_8530"&gt;4. Collaborative, not competitive, product development is key.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="54e2a3_1444" data-ic-marker="54e2a3_1444_t3"&gt;Most of the devices in our homes are designed separately from one another. Despite technology standards and reducing platform fragmentation, we're still not at a point where services work seamlessly across products unless they come from one company. It's hard for designers think like this when they often working for a single brand. But more cross-collaboration between brands could deliver much more complete and interesting solutions for consumers in the home. Each brand able to bring their particular strengths to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4c4152_3533" data-ic-marker="f9aa3b_766"&gt;&lt;b id="10080d_2346" style="font-size: 1.1em;"&gt;5. Technology as a social enabler, rather than social barrier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8dd25f_680" data-ic-marker="80942b_792"&gt;Currently, technology is focused around personal devices, which often isolate people from one other. But ambient technology, where we don't have to interact with our digital products through screens, opens up opportunities for more multi-user experiences that can reintroduce or enhance the social experiences we have in our homes. Through whole-room experiences we will be able to interact and collaborate together seamlessly in the same space which we wouldn't have been able to do before. Suddenly, technology becomes a social enabler, rather than a barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2c439_2469" data-ic-marker="dd617f_1798"&gt;In the past, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft utilised cameras with depth sensing to understand multiple users inputs for gaming purposes. Now more advanced systems coming on stream like Intel's RealSense and Amazon's AWS DeepLens coupled with deep learning algorithms are allowing designer to conceive new multi user experiences for their everyday lives not simply for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="479737_3449" data-ic-marker="40753e_981"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cc3718_418" data-ic-marker="4dd8de_943"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949910_81_89614_xDwvaZTJK.png"&gt;&lt;em id="d2178f_6493" class="caption"&gt;Amazon's &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/" target="_blank"&gt;AWS DeepLens&lt;/a&gt; is a programmable and trainable smart camera &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1f8bb9_2203" data-ic-marker="277509_1925"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Technology must be constantly interrogated.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1c563b_1629" data-ic-marker="ed07e1_1187"&gt;A word of caution was raised about embedding observant and data capturing technologies into our homes. Rick Marks from Google ATAP identified the move away from cloud computing to edge computing, which stores data more locally to where it's being used rather than on a small number of centralised data centres, as partly relating to concerns over trust and privacy. Indeed, there is an ongoing tension between the desire to create better and new experiences enabled by data-gathering services and growing concerns around surveillance. We need to fully understand the implications of new technologies in this area and bake-in privacy and trust into all products and experiences we create for our future homes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/core77/blog/~4/SiryEf8lgf8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><dc:creator>Rain Noe</dc:creator><media:content url="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/lead_n_spotlight/949894_title__89614_28Jdjk3Gq.jpg" type="image/jpeg" medium="image" width="1600" height="625" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.core77.com/posts/89614/What-Roles-Should-Design-n-Technology-Play-in-Our-Homes</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">00015de1-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</guid><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/core77/blog/~3/cV_0G4ks_Tk/How-Losing-to-GoPro-Helped-Marc-Barros-Build-Moment</link><title>How Losing to GoPro Helped Marc Barros Build Moment </title><description>&lt;p id="5845f7_821" data-ic-marker="7cc6ad_1843"&gt;Marc Barros suffered from optimism. When GoPro raised $80 million just a few months after his action camera company Contour raised $10 million, he celebrated the competition as proof of the potential of these types of products. "That should have been the 'Oh shit' moment," he realizes in retrospect. "That should have been like, 'Wait a second, stop. How are we going to compete?' We didn't understand that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9578dc_542" data-ic-marker="444d2a_5406"&gt;Contour failed—&lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/18/these-3-charts-show-why-gopros-comeback-will-be-ch.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro has struggled plenty, too&lt;/a&gt;—but Barros turned what he learned from that experience into a successful new company. &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moment/moment-air-anamorphic-lens-filters-and-cases-for-drones?ref=ksrsocial-core77&amp;amp;banner=invent-newsletter01" target="_blank"&gt;Moment&lt;/a&gt;, best known for its mobile photography gear, has attracted more than 1.5 million followers and raised more than $3 million on Kickstarter over the course of five campaigns. Their latest—for an &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moment/moment-air-anamorphic-lens-filters-and-cases-for-drones?ref=ksrsocial-core77&amp;amp;banner=invent-newsletter01" target="_blank" id="a20541_160"&gt;anamorphic lens, filters, and cases for drones&lt;/a&gt;—takes their offerings to new heights. As it racks up thousands of backers, we sat down with Barros to hear how his past failure helped shape his approach to growing Moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f29387_1835" data-ic-marker="8cee83_1581"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="880" data-image-id="949538" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949538_115274_89569_8v05UiCJW.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id="2458ea_134_c"&gt;The problem with Contour was that they were doing too much, without enough "why"&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="3a07e_493" data-ic-marker="a0fcbb_3093"&gt;"I think when you lose, you make more reflections on why you lost," Barros says—and those reflections guide his work now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fbc7f7_779" data-ic-marker="4617f_5362"&gt;The biggest mistake Contour's product-focused team made was almost entirely ignoring how storytelling translates into new customers. "We were not capturing consumer hearts," Barros says. "We really tried to be functional, to capture minds. We thought that the best product would win. GoPro captured hearts. They really owned action video at its essence; they showed the emotion of that experience. They just beat the shit out of us." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="445f3e_828" data-ic-marker="2364c5_1930"&gt;Barros also acknowledges now that he probably wasn't the right person to express that emotion. He acknowledges now that Contour wasn't aligned with his own photography passions. "I wasn't really into action video," he admits. "I wasn't going home and making action videos. I think the purpose just wasn't there, beyond wanting to make something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a1d391_391" data-ic-marker="938fcb_1258"&gt;What Barros felt passionate about was photography. So when his investors fired him in 2012—the company went bankrupt nine months later—Barros thought about how his next project, Moment, could come from a more genuine place. "We started with a much better why: the happiness photography brings." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id="11169f_604_c"&gt;Restarting with more room for experimentation&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="c968f_246" data-ic-marker="89ab5a_4550"&gt;Barros remembers his first digital camera was a game changer for his photography; he loved the instant feedback loop of "shooting, learning, getting better at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ae7eae_696" data-ic-marker="a4917e_4377"&gt;"It's very similar to that ethos of 'Make something, see if customers will buy it, and then learn,'" he says—and it's a mentality that's deeply ingrained in Moment's product philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ae1abe_985" data-ic-marker="bf07d1_3573"&gt;Having made complicated cameras with Contour, Barros wanted to start Moment in a simple way, as a single lens that the team could evolve and improve over time. "We literally started with glass and metal. We just started concepting, prototyping, and then put it on Kickstarter to see what would happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ee9604_754" data-ic-marker="76fee4_6545"&gt;Their first campaign, for quality wide and tele lenses that attach onto smartphones, soon raised half a million dollars in pledges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id="3dcf50_708_c"&gt;The marketing team: Marketers need not apply&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="491a03_318" data-ic-marker="17558a_3124"&gt;As Barros built his simple product proposal into a thriving company, he put authentic storytelling first. He tried traditional ads, too, but time and time again, his hypothesis proved true: Real content from relatable personalities was what resonated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4d03ba_885" data-ic-marker="d605ee_4337"&gt;Moment's marketing strategy is to not do any marketing. "All the people we hire are either a designer, engineer, or content creator," he says. "The people who call themselves marketers are all about marketing, and they want to be good at the skill set of marketing. If someone's LinkedIn says 'marketer,' I'm not interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cb4d97_907" data-ic-marker="c77f76_6577"&gt;Instead, he thinks in terms of hiring customers, or the types of people who might be customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c0145c_1735" data-ic-marker="9b9e9_901"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="1100" data-image-id="949535" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949535_115274_89569_MY95kR2qI.jpg"&gt;&lt;em id="841ee1_471" class="caption"&gt;Taylor Pendleton field testing Moment's new  &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moment/moment-air-anamorphic-lens-filters-and-cases-for-drones?ref=ksrsocial-core77&amp;amp;banner=invent-newsletter01" id="3f5bbc_8116" target="_blank"&gt;anamorphic lens&lt;/a&gt;—and making social content about it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c8746a_293" data-ic-marker="1f5aeb_4958"&gt;"At Contour, if you looked at the 50 employees, they were all there for a different reason. Some were into the product, some were into action sports, some were just there for startup [culture]. This time around, we looked for people who are into photography and filmmaking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="781e80_1125" data-ic-marker="3d0826_3472"&gt;Many team members were first photography influencers whom Barros shared the product with for reviews. Caleb Babcock, Niles Grey Jeran, and Taylor Pendleton, who make frequent appearances on the brand's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDqzuoZDmQ1u9oNZ_F3zi4A" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/moment/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, post their own reviews and guides that follow vlogger formats and don't come off as overly professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8ad809_967" data-ic-marker="9aa77f_6619"&gt;"They're just honest about it," says Barros. "It's not scripted; they're trying the products like a regular user. They explain what they like, what they don't like. They're advanced as filmmakers, but they aren't over-the-top pros you can't relate to. I think that their relatability is a really important thread in what we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="da3ffa_507" data-ic-marker="574d36_3679"&gt;"We put the product in the hands of the core customer, and we build everything around that. We see how they talk about it, how they share it with friends, how they would use it. That drives the campaign. If your team isn't the exact customer, that's going to be harder for you. Everything we do starts with asking who the customer is, getting the prototype in their hands, and riffing with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 id="1e9bcb_356_c"&gt;Expanding the offering, growing the community&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p id="c98817_981" data-ic-marker="13625_6140"&gt;The feedback loop isn't restricted to photography fans in the office. Working closely with the community and listening to what users are excited about online has helped the team expand into new types of marketing and even products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cf1506_1311" data-ic-marker="7aeb9e_5999"&gt;In 2016, the company hosted their first &lt;a href="https://www.shopmoment.com/the-moment-invitational-film-festival" target="_blank"&gt;Moment Invitational Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; with just over a dozen participants. "That—like everything—started simple," Barros says. "We just said, 'Let's try to make some inspiring films.' Then we commissioned creators we thought were amazing. And from there we learned a lot. So by the time we got to year four, it was way more sophisticated." The 2019 festival drew 1,100 filmmakers competing for $100,000 in cash and gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7230f2_268" data-ic-marker="71691_1416"&gt;"I think that's a rule of thumb in everything we do," Barros says. "What's the simplest thing you can do? See if it works, then do more of it if it's working."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bf5fca_1271" data-ic-marker="955ebc_3201"&gt;The company is now starting to test this iterative approach with a more high-touch service: photography tours and workshops. "We found that our customers were coming to us because they were going to take a trip. At the same time they were asking us for tips on where to go and how to improve. So we started doing these small custom trips. We would take our customers to say Alaska for little eight-person workshops. Out of that we realized that people were really into the trips, experiences, and learning. So a year ago we launched photography trips run by a pro guide." Upcoming excursions are heading to Kyrgyzstan, Bali, Iceland, and dozens of other picturesque destinations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e51251_6757" data-ic-marker="bb7cd4_2251"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="680" data-image-height="383" data-image-id="949537" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949537_115274_89569_W8P8ak8eT.png"&gt;&lt;em id="f89a9e_54" class="caption"&gt;An Iceland expedition led by Chris König. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8cee93_949" data-ic-marker="d167f3_3500"&gt;It's all part of the experimental outlook that drives the company.

It both reflected popular culture and influenced it. The Italian avant-garde movements of the 1950's &amp;amp; 60's played with new forms, surfaces, pattern, transparency and gloss levels that expressed and celebrated the aesthetic of plastic and marked its evolution away from the dark Bakelite of its early incarnation. Since then plastic has gone from a well-rounded, glossy and bright colored character into a personality that is still trying to find it's place in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ed8915_3676_c" data-ic-marker="cea159_286"&gt;Petra Cullmann, director of the K Show, the most important plastic trade show on earth, explains that a better approach to our relationship with plastic is not simply "reducing plastic" but instead to use it more thoughtfully, such as to reduce the weight in cars, which leads to greater fuel efficiency. Considered use of materials can help communicate the notion of sustainability in products. Educating consumers on the value of a material made from post-consumer waste, or the value of a vehicle that weighs less than it otherwise would is challenging. How can we adapt the appearance of plastic to give it a higher perceived value versus the 'real' materials that are so dominant, like glass and metals, that would perhaps encourage us to keep our products longer and thereby reduce consumption. What is the aesthetic of plastics and what are the trends that capture the CMF that is in constant motion?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c703f6_6631" data-ic-marker="5c7087_6689"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="879" data-image-height="587" data-image-id="949712" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949712_4_89593_4uPeaiHpo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4e35a3_673" data-ic-marker="f05bdf_797"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f71a10_3239" data-ic-marker="66237a_128"&gt;Transparency gives us confidence in our products, a feeling of achievement. It gives products an alluring look of partial visibility and it is one of the most searched attributes in design materials databases. A transparent window in a product housing allows users to understand its workings. A Dyson vacuum cleaner gives you an emotional reward and sense of achievement by showing you the dirt that was once on your floor tidily captured in a sealed bin. Transparency has functional, sensorial and emotional rewards. As plastics advance to technically challenge the properties of glass, so do the opportunities to create poetic color combinations through subtly tinted translucent plastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="27fe63_6520" data-ic-marker="da96e4_36"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="723" data-image-id="949714" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949714_4_89593_WMnaPrfMf.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7024bf_1688" data-ic-marker="5f8601_1004"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sustainable composites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e3cf24_3632" data-ic-marker="755328_223"&gt;While some brands may not want to make a noise about their environmental approach to plastics, there are others that want to make sure these stories take on an aesthetic that can be appreciated by consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3c3bbb_534" data-ic-marker="8e72a6_1223"&gt;The first wave of bio-based plastics resulted in a crunchy and brown aesthetic due to the mostly wood fibre content mixed with virgin plastics. Today the speckled effect is the 'on-trend' evolution of this giving consumers a refined update. But the idea of using post-consumer waste from engineering plastics in cars and electronics means it is difficult to get away from black and grey. Plastic compounders are now developing ingredients to give these materials a new aesthetic lease of life based on bright colors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="23263e_3197" data-ic-marker="84b316_1019"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soft tactility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7fa397_3153" data-ic-marker="771e94_593"&gt;Ivy Ross, VP of Hardware Design at Google, explains that Google's approach to plastics is one that gives tech a soft, human, relatable personality. In this group plastics take on a decorative and functional aesthetic–patterns are molded onto both rigid and soft plastics, creating sensorial cues that focus on tactility that feel like they are taking plastics into areas of emotional comfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="735855_2680" data-ic-marker="f1d201_90"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="647" data-image-id="949716" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949716_4_89593_3n3pFb8Tz.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ef8545_1343" data-ic-marker="d489aa_376"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Premium plastic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="350f55_3992" data-ic-marker="dfbc2d_1383"&gt;Plastic plays to both the low and high ground in its aesthetic, from low-cost to the premium 'unashamedly plastic' of how Apple described iPhone 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b1549_1623" data-ic-marker="a3ba63_316"&gt;The concept that plastics can be used to define a premium experience where the product is elevated rather than being covered up points to a future where plastics could be used for more durable products that we want to keep rather than treat as disposable. Sensitive design can celebrate the intrinsic properties of plastics through thoughtful treatment of their processing. As the contemporary cousin of 'luxury', premium plastics can be a very slippery thing to define. Many brands are searching for ways to elevate materials to this higher level but figuring out how to achieve this when specifying plastics can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b0616_1781" data-ic-marker="e967c7_1633"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div contenteditable="false" class="img_wrapper no_slideshow large clear_both"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.k-online.com/en/Materials_and_Design?utm_source=core77&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog-post" class="allow_link_go" style="border-bottom: none;display:  inline-block;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="194" data-image-id="949987" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949987_4_89593_7KnWQtNPT.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="" id="5a9df_3591" data-ic-marker="1f34a9_2268"&gt;&lt;i id="dbf759_5001"&gt;This post is presented by the &lt;a href="https://www.k-online.com/en/Materials_and_Design?utm_source=core77&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog-post" target="_blank"&gt;K-Show, the world's No.1 trade fair for the plastics and rubber industry&lt;/a&gt;.

Though a relatively new award program—it was launched in 2016—it received over 2,500 submissions from around the world this year and that number is only expected to increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7e348a_6707" data-ic-marker="93a140_8749"&gt;The 50,000 euro prize that each year's winner receives may have something to do with its appeal, and this year all shortlisted applicants will also get to participate in a group exhibition at Paris's Musée des Arts Décoratifs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5327ad_1837" data-ic-marker="82e6d8_435"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="629" data-image-id="949749" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949749_33852_89598_7IughA2D2.jpg"&gt;&lt;em id="6134ac_2315" class="caption"&gt;View of the 2019 semifinalist exhibition at Isamu Noguchi's indoor stone garden at the Sogetsu Kaikan in Tokyo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c45797_5990" data-ic-marker="3e562e_9446"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="880" data-image-height="660" data-image-id="949730" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949730_33852_89598_86uJsmPZw.jpg"&gt;&lt;em id="602d8d_1233" class="caption"&gt;Japanese sculptor &lt;a href="https://gentaishizuka.com/" id="ed36b4_1326" target="_blank"&gt;Genta Ishizuka&lt;/a&gt; took home the top prize this year. An expert in the ancient &lt;i id="faa630_2796"&gt;urushi &lt;/i&gt;lacquer technique, Ishizuka was inspired by oranges in a mesh bag when he created his winning work, &lt;i&gt;Surface Tactility #11&lt;/i&gt;. Ishizuka used the &lt;i&gt;kanshitsu&lt;/i&gt; technique, naturally-sourced &lt;i&gt;urushi&lt;/i&gt; sap, and many coats of lacquer to create the lustrous finish. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="454169_3045" data-ic-marker="b810_4949"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="879" data-image-height="539" data-image-id="949734" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949734_33852_89598_3TN7pEIL_.jpg"&gt;&lt;em id="58cac8_1202" class="caption"&gt;&lt;em id="93b319_3043" class="caption"&gt;Deloss Webber's Geisha Handbag Series (2016) is made of granite, Susutake bamboo, rattan, and is an homage to Japanese weaving techniques. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8b3ca2_1794" data-ic-marker="3df1dd_6510"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="879" data-image-height="539" data-image-id="949736" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949736_33852_89598_HzIDOU8UK.jpg"&gt;&lt;em id="40973b_1414" class="caption"&gt;Giovanni Corvaja, Italy, Mandala bowl, 18ct gold, 2017 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e62baf_8266" data-ic-marker="8a55d7_2704"&gt;&lt;img data-image-width="879" data-image-height="539" data-image-id="949738" src="https://s3files.core77.com/blog/images/949738_33852_89598_4ZuZ49AKS.jpg"&gt;&lt;em id="3b741e_4376" class="caption"&gt;Jim Partridge and Liz Walmsley, United Kingdom, Curved Block Seat, oak, 2018  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="24f17d_5558" data-ic-marker="6d4f8_3211"&gt;&lt;em id="4180_6746" class="caption"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="305c12_284" data-ic-marker="6994e2_159"&gt;The prize was created to "acknowledge the importance of craft in today's culture and recognize working artisans whose talent, vision and will to innovate set a standard for the future." Creative director Jonathan Anderson started the tradition as a nod to Loewe's beginnings as a collective craft workshop in 1846. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="eddb2c_8488" data-ic-marker="cfb93b_3477"&gt;To select a winner from thousands of applicants, Loewe first brings together a panel of experts—made up of former finalists and a variety of interdisciplinary professionals—to whittle all the applicants down to 30 semifinalists. That group of 30 will travel to Paris and exhibit their work at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. A separate jury will convene in Paris and choose a winner from the exhibition. This year's jury includes Naoto Fukasawa, Patricia Urquiola, Deyan Sudjic, and Benedetta Tagliabue, alongside other leading figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b4fc4a_8131" data-ic-marker="7c759b_3695"&gt;The jury will be looking at the following factors: originality, clear artistic vision and merit, precise execution, material excellence, innovative value, and a distinct authorial mark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6ea7d3_7684" data-ic-marker="e64c38_7238"&gt;Applications are open through October 30.

(Czech Republic) It is a two-seat vehicle that represents modern design and practicality in one. The unique design of the three-wheeled vehicle has many advantages in crowded cities, the most important of which are affordability and its dual design, one of which is also for teenagers from 15 years of age. With the aging of the world's population, it is necessary to adapt to seniors and people with limited mobility, which can be easily suited, as the floor is low and level. In addition, the small size of the vehicle allows it to be parked perpendicular to other cars, saving space. &lt;/p&gt;
