Their entrances followed a script: One by one, they entered the restaurant’s outdoor terrace, immediately whipped out a phone, and began taking photos and videos. One young woman retraced her steps through the entrance four times as a friend filmed her from different angles. Another held her phone aloft for a selfie while twirling a cloud of cotton candy. Others rushed to the porch’s edge to take yet more selfies. Two boys posed in similar-looking tracksuits before one stripped off his hoodie to soak in the 85-degree weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DJ, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/misslelabrown/?hl=en"&gt;Lela B&lt;/a&gt;—also an Instagram influencer, according to one of the company’s press representatives—was playing clean, radio-friendly versions of top 40 hits. The crowd wore crop tops, layers of mesh, lots of neon, and, for roughly 40 percent of the men, some form of Gucci shoes. “I feel like I’m living in the &lt;a href="https://later.com/blog/how-to-get-on-instagram-explore-page/"&gt;Explore page&lt;/a&gt;,” Adam Waheed, an influencer and a comedian with 1.5 million followers on Instagram, remarked. Instagram-branded donuts melted in the hot sun.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The occasion was Instabeach, an exclusive, invite-only annual party hosted by the photo-sharing platform for 500 top creators along with plus-ones, talent representatives, managers, and—for the first time—press. The goal, according to Justin Antony, Instagram’s head of creators and emerging talent partnerships, is to help influencers meet one another, mingle, and form friendships. But what started three years ago as a casual beach party for a class of people that was once maligned by the traditional entertainment industry has become a who’s who of young Hollywood, a sun-soaked declaration of just how completely enmeshed Instagram has become with the teen-entertainment world. Instagram isn’t just a place to connect with friends, share memes, and post life highlights—it’s where more and more young stars go to make a name for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Instabeach_Previews_21/0eaee89cd.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stepping onto the sandy porch at Gladstones felt like walking into an eighth-grade graduation party hosted by one of the popular kids. The older influencers, those in their early and mid-20s—like &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/meg-deangelis.html"&gt;Meg DeAngelis&lt;/a&gt;, who has 1.7 million followers on Instagram; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/brentrivera"&gt;Brent Rivera&lt;/a&gt;, a former Viner with 15 million followers on Instagram; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/mylifeaseva/?hl=en"&gt;Eva Gutowski&lt;/a&gt;, who has 6.8 million followers on Instagram—gave out lots of hugs and emitted a deep older-sibling energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, the younger, up-and-coming creators chased waves, lounged in the sun, and sipped on Instagram-branded coconut water served in fresh coconuts. There was talk of dares. In the bathroom, two girls anxiously discussed a boy they were hoping to see at the event, refreshing his Instagram story multiple times, looking for clues. Everyone speculated about whether David Dobrik, a massive YouTube star who is also popular on Instagram, would show up (in the end, he did not, though he has attended in past years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Instabeach_Previews_63/43f3fd68a.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jaheem Toombs, 17, and his friends surveyed the scene on the beach, explaining that though pretty much everyone at the party knew one another, they all had their own separate cliques. “We are all actors,” he explained. “But there’s this unspoken divider; even though we are all in the same industry, we are all in different worlds and bubbles.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Among them: the cooler, older, more well-known influencers, who had mostly come to put in face time with Instagram execs. Then there were the Instagram comedians, who huddled in circles roasting one another and anyone who came by. There were the dancers—spottable by their sneakers and propensity for casual backflips—and the hypebeasts, who arrived clad in Louis Vuitton and obscure streetwear. The self-proclaimed “Brat pack” consisted of about seven boys and a couple of girls, all of whom star in shows on Brat, a digital-first teen-entertainment company that produces web series for YouTube. “We hang out with other people too, but we’re just close with each other,” explained Greg Marks, an 18-year-old actor on Brat’s web series &lt;em&gt;Chicken Girls&lt;/em&gt;. The Brat crew is close with many members of the broader child-star group—the default popular kids, who have roles on Disney, Nickelodeon, or Netflix shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Instabeach_Previews_26/b2fe449f2.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This year’s party also featured a strong contingent of TikTokers, people who have become famous on (and off) the short-form video app that launched less than a year ago and is &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/tiktok-stars-are-preparing-take-over-internet/593878/?utm_source=feed"&gt;rapidly encroaching&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube as the web’s star factory. When I asked &lt;a href="http://www.instagram.com/sebastianbails/?hl=en"&gt;Sebastian Bails&lt;/a&gt;, half of a successful TikTok comedy duo, what TikTok stars were doing at an Instagram event, he laughed. “We definitely consider ourselves influencers,” he said. “On TikTok, all people see is 15 seconds. On Insta, they can see photos of our life,” Lauren Godwin, another TikTok star, explained. “We want to share our content all different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their roles in respective groups, everyone at the party had one thing in common: a massive Instagram following. All the young entertainers I spoke with were savvy about their audience; I overheard conversations about strategies for engaging with fan accounts and growing followers. While older celebrities largely treat Instagram as a marketing apparatus or an outlet to show their personality off-screen, the influencers at Instabeach viewed social media as a tool that they could leverage to get what they want in life, whether it be a record deal or role on a hit show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="543" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/8422b6a41/ddcbe588c.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There’s no longer a distinction between being an influencer and an entertainer, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicabelkin/?hl=en"&gt;Jessica Belkin&lt;/a&gt;, a 17-year-old with more than 362,000 followers on Instagram, explained to me. “Social media has helped me with business, friendships, fans, exposure. It only helps [you] to have a following,” she said. “I’m not offended when people call me an influencer rather than an actress, because it’s all the same.” Tori Kay, a 17-year-old singer with 62,000 followers on Instagram, nodded her head in agreement as Belkin spoke. “There’s no line anymore,” she said. “It’s not two different worlds. It’s both. Your influence is your exposure, and singing is your talent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;People who are eager to rise up as creative artists always tend to be multi-hyphenates,” said Sarah Unger, senior vice president of strategy at Civic Entertainment Group. In recent years, more people have appended “influencer” to their credentials, she said: model/DJs are now model/DJ/influencers. “[Social-media following is] sort of a default method of currency that at this point has been ingrained in our societal structures,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Instabeach_Previews_77/7e9cff13c.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dan Weinstein, co-founder and President of &lt;a href="https://www.studio71.com/us/contact/"&gt;Studio71&lt;/a&gt;, an influencer-management platform, said that this next generation of stars are simply the by-product of this larger shift in the entertainment world. “Whether or not younger creators’ end goal is being on a TV show or film, they’re all building an audience and figuring out how to build some kind of influence and relevance,” Weinstein said. Traditional actors such as Will Smith and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson are working hard to expand their digital footprint and become multi-platform influencers, while younger talent, like those at Instabeach, are using social-media attention to land roles and build a dedicated fan base while they wait to get cast. But, Weinstein added, “the one thing YouTube and Instagram haven’t done is change the ratio of talented to not-talented people in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="759" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/IMG_5645/089b56a9a.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And when follower counts come to matter as much as raw talent to some casting agents, things can get competitive. Teenage entertainers are painfully aware of how crucial performing well on a platform like Instagram can be to their success. “I’ve done over 70 commercials, but when I go in, they ask how many followers I have on social media,” said Kaylyn Slevin, an 18-year-old model, actor, influencer, and former Miss Malibu Teen USA. Collaborating with the right people and growing your audience independently are key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Instabeach_Previews_70/acb2b93a9.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some young stars are already cynical about this new world. Greg Kasyan, a 21-year-old actor who has appeared on &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; and has more than 200,000 Instagram followers, watched the party from the rocks by the beach so as not to dirty the socks he’d worn under his Gucci slides. Kasyan has worked as a traditional actor for years, and was frustrated by how some kids younger than he is seem to pursue careers in entertainment only for the clout. “Kids here, they group up to gain followers, to collaborate,” he said. “A lot of these kids are really cool, but some are just hanging with each other for followers. I’m not that kind of person.” Still, he said he was friends with a lot of people at the event and hoped to use the party to meet girls. “I wanna leave [the party] with a couple baddies,” he joked, referring to attractive women. “Whoever is 18 and over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="u-block-center"&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="896" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/IMG_5453/1fa9a39a3.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Courtesy Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By 5:30 p.m., after several hours of partying and networking, everyone loosened up. “Mi Gente” was blasting out of the speakers, and partygoers were told to clear the dance floor so that Russell Horning—the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X6b19ukfTA"&gt;Backpack Kid&lt;/a&gt;” who popularized the dance move flossing—could perform. He and some friends danced as influencers circled around him, phones in hand, to capture the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When the sun began to get low in the sky an hour later, the music stopped and everyone began swapping handles. They took one last opportunity to pose for pictures, as their parents idled in their cars, waiting patiently. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jordynjones/"&gt;Jordyn Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a 19-year-old with 5.8 million Instagram followers, asked her boyfriend, Jordan Beau, who has more than 660,000 Instagram followers, to pretend to fight Sean Cavaliere (336,000 followers) for a &lt;a href="http://www.instagram.com/p/B0AeFh5lKw6/"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt;. Tori Kay stood off to the side, barefoot and clutching a pair of clear plastic heels. The party was a success, she said. But now she was waiting for her mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/UMuuOPokoso" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Taylor Lorenz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/taylor-lorenz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/Instabeach/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Instagram / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Where Everyone’s an Influencer</title><published>2019-07-31T15:04:03-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T10:42:32-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Inside Instagram’s annual beach party, where Hollywood and social media collide</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/UMuuOPokoso/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/where-everyones-an-influencer/595213/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595087</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0ZRtwEF7Nr/"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; on Courtney Perkins’s Instagram account, two gray-haired women stand with their arms around each other, their gazes purposeful, their mouths unsmiling. It’s not clear who they are or what they’re doing, but the two have planned their outfits for the occasion: One woman is wearing a turquoise T-shirt that says &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;I get us out of trouble&lt;/span&gt; in a white block print. Next to her, the second woman’s coral shirt declares,&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt; I get us into trouble&lt;/span&gt;. She’s also wearing sunglasses, presumably because she’s the cool one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To make the photo into a meme, Perkins, a 24-year-old comedy writer living in Los Angeles, divvied up the 12 zodiac signs under the two shirts’ proclamations. She then posted the finished product to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/notallgeminis/"&gt;@notallgeminis&lt;/a&gt;, an astrology-meme account she created in 2017 that now has nearly half a million followers. The comments underneath the post are full of thousands of people, mainly young women, tagging the Thelmas to their Louises with messages like “thank u for looking after me n my heart.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Different corners of the internet are devoted to different pastimes: yelling about current events, posting vacation photos, sharing recipes. Each medium tends to have its own conventions about how to appropriately express emotion, which might mean ironic detachment on Twitter, placid domesticity on Facebook, or political rage pretty much anywhere. But research shows that young Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/teen-mental-health-worries/583531/?utm_source=feed"&gt;acutely aware&lt;/a&gt; of their own emotional struggles and those of their peers, and many of them seem to want an online home for their more tender thoughts. In the past two years, millions of them have found a conduit to talk to one another about their real lives: massively popular meme accounts and newer micro-social apps, all devoted to astrology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s Julie Beck &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/?utm_source=feed"&gt;noted in early 2018&lt;/a&gt;, astrology has rerooted itself in American youth culture at precisely the time many young people, who are &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/06/13/younger-people-are-less-religious-than-older-ones-in-many-countries-especially-in-the-u-s-and-europe/"&gt;less religious&lt;/a&gt; and more online than ever, feel adrift. “It does give one a pleasing orderly sort of feeling, not unlike alphabetizing a library, to take life’s random events and emotions and slot them into helpfully labeled shelves,” Beck wrote. That’s especially true among &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evgg9a/the-rise-of-the-queer-astrology-movement"&gt;queer people&lt;/a&gt; and in other marginalized communities, where it’s common to look outside of mainstream culture for ways to process and talk about experiences. Accounts like Perkins’s @notallgeminis, many of which are run by meme-makers in their teens and 20s, allow young people to turn that introspection outward and into something more social.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The new age of astrology&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because meme accounts exist within Instagram’s standard messaging and sharing structure, their creators have a front-row seat to the interactions sparked by their posts, such as the sweet notes in the comments section under the troublemaking elderly duo. “What I’ve found is that astrology is a jumping-off point for what people really want to talk about, and that can be anything,” Perkins says. “Astrology is a framework for analyzing yourself and your experiences, and people naturally bring other people into that.” On Instagram, the self-aware humor of meme culture lowers the stakes of involving friends in your personal reflections. Addressing the tedium and emotional distress of everyday life might be a lot easier if you lead with a photo of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ByqdMp2FsFK/"&gt;Martha Stewart riding a horse into the ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Banu Guler, a co-founder of the astrology app Co-Star, thinks the ease with which astrology allows people to talk about personal struggles and negative emotions plays a huge role in its popularity. “It’s much easier to say, ‘I’m a Capricorn, so it’s hard for me to express my feelings,’ than to walk into a room and be like, ‘I’m an emotionally repressed psycho,’” she says. Perkins, too, has noticed that she gets a deeper reaction when her memes allude to the signs’ more negative qualities—that is, when her followers feel “&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/teens-are-roasting-each-other-for-the-huh-challenge"&gt;dragged and roasted&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Astrology can allow people to depersonalize and recontextualize their emotions as part of a common, collective journey, which can battle the isolation that often comes with feeling sad or anxious. In American culture, emotional struggles or “difficult” personalities are often seen as personal failings. In its own way, astrology gives people an opportunity to acknowledge the forces and power structures beyond the self that affect mood and behavior. At its best, it can encourage self-awareness instead of self-flagellation. That’s particularly important for young people, for whom shame can be &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-shame-sucks-especiall_b_4760272"&gt;especially harmful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Research has also generally found that those with deeply held spiritual beliefs, such as faith in the personality-predicting powers of the stars, have better mental-health outcomes. But &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/longform/a40140/horoscope-habit-impacts-your-mental-health/"&gt;some psychologists&lt;/a&gt; believe that those effects may be more muted with astrology, with its intensely self-reflective nature, than in traditional religion, which tends to come with a community. Through social media, astrology buffs are building that crucial interpersonal network. “I get messages all the time about how I’m the main way people keep in touch with their siblings or their friend across the country, or that they have a group chat about my memes,” Perkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/instagram-meme-and-theme-accounts/581113/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Instagram meme accounts are pretty now&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-Star, which launched in late 2017, is part of a new crop of apps, along with &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28384610/channing-tatum-astrology-app-pattern/"&gt;The Pattern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/sanctuary-astrology-app.html"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, that use the time and location of a person’s birth to generate a detailed natal chart that goes deeper than the sun-sign horoscopes first developed as &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/horoscopes_astrology.php"&gt;newspaper curiosities&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these apps have significant Instagram followings of their own (Co-Star has more than 600,000 followers) and post &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0CD0LYFW8s/"&gt;sleek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0HUSPmjvhY/"&gt;well-designed&lt;/a&gt; memes, complete with soothing colors and fashionable fonts, that have a more professional feel than the DIY culture built by Perkins and her contemporaries. The aesthetic seriousness offers an option for people who want to joke about feelings and anxiety, but don’t think an image of the &lt;em&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/em&gt; cast mate Snooki sipping from a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BrsggmLFJVZ/"&gt;giant, beer-infused margarita&lt;/a&gt; is the note they want to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Co-Star has also spawned a different kind of sharing: The app’s frank (or &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/why-are-co-stars-daily-notifications-so-rude-1833747335"&gt;rude&lt;/a&gt;, depending how you look at it) daily push notifications have developed a social-media life of their own. The messages, which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clairetmars/status/1154800456742449154?s=20"&gt;say things like&lt;/a&gt;, “Your biggest challenge is to avoid becoming dead inside,” are frequently screenshotted and shared by users on Twitter and Instagram who feel, well, dragged and roasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The notifications are generated by artificial intelligence, and Guler says the company is constantly tweaking the formula to strike the right note. “We really try to think about how we talk to and text each other,” she explains. “It’s not sunshine and rainbows; it’s also pushing each other to be better humans and think more clearly.” Many people seem to find the approach compelling: Co-Star had &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/05/co-star-astrology-app-notifications-founder"&gt;more than 3 million members&lt;/a&gt; as of April, and the app has a five-star rating in the Apple App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;No matter your preferred medium, experts agree that a willingness to open up to others is a key step in the process of maintaining mental health. A close reading of one’s natal chart is by no means a replacement for necessary professional care, but &lt;a href="https://childmind.org/article/talk-mental-health-issues/"&gt;the Child Mind Institute&lt;/a&gt; calls reaching out “a vital part of getting the help you need,” and &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-25900-001"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that repressing negative emotions worsens stress. With rates of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and suicidality &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/03/mental-health-adults"&gt;rising among young people&lt;/a&gt;, astrology’s ability to break down communication barriers and depersonalize the prohibitively personal has proved valuable to plenty of people. “That’s why astrology has stuck around for so long, especially in communities of punks and queers and anyone outside of mainstream culture,” Guler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/how-birth-season-affects-mood/381727/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How birth season affects personality&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now interest in the practice goes far beyond those communities—a 2014 study by the National Science Foundation found that almost &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/index.cfm/chapter-7/c7h.htm"&gt;half of Americans&lt;/a&gt; believe astrology is at least sort of scientific, the highest proportion the organization has found since 1983. In the years since those data were collected, astrology has only gained cultural momentum, in part because of the efforts of people like Perkins and Guler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There’s no scientific evidence that the planets have an effect on personality or behavior, but as with any system of belief, total adherence to astrology’s teachings isn’t necessary to dabble in its benefits.

The game continues to sell about 1 million copies every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how it goes: Players race down a sinuous but linear track, its spaces tinted one of six colors or marked by a special candy symbol. They draw from a deck of cards corresponding to the board’s colors and symbols. They move their token to the next space that matches the drawn color or teleport to the space matching the symbol. The first to reach the end of the track is the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing the participants say or do influences the outcome; the winner is decided the second the deck is shuffled, and all that remains is to see it revealed, one draw at a time. It is a game absent strategy, requiring little thought. Consequently, many parents &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2009/01/26/the-case-against-can.html"&gt;hate&lt;/a&gt; Candy Land as much as their young kids enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet for all its simplicity and limitations, children still love Candy Land, and adults still buy it. What makes it so appealing? The answer may have something to do with the game’s history: It was invented by Eleanor Abbott, a schoolteacher, in a polio ward during the epidemic of the 1940s and ’50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-a-bad-nights-sleep-birthed-the-sound-conditioner/592177/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How a bad night’s sleep birthed the sound conditioner&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The outbreak had forced children into extremely restrictive environments. Patients were confined by equipment, and parents kept healthy children inside for fear they might catch the disease. Candy Land offered the kids in Abbott’s ward a welcome distraction—but it also gave immobilized patients a liberating fantasy of movement. That aspect of the game still resonates with children today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poliomyelitis—better known as polio—was once a feared disease. It struck suddenly, paralyzing its victims, most of whom were children. The virus targets the nerve cells in the spinal cord, inhibiting the body’s control over its muscles. This leads to muscle weakness, decay, or outright fatality in extreme cases. The leg muscles are the most common sites of polio damage, along with the muscles of the head, neck, and diaphragm. In the last case, a patient would require the aid of an iron lung, a massive, coffinlike enclosure that forces the afflicted body to breathe. For children, whose still-developing bodies are more vulnerable to polio infection, the muscle wastage from polio can result in disfigurement if left untreated. Treatment typically involves physical therapy to stimulate muscle development, followed by braces to ensure that the affected parts of the body retain their shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines appeared in the 1950s, and the disease was essentially eradicated by the end of the millennium. But in the mid-century, polio was a medical bogeyman, ushering in a climate of hysteria. “There was no prevention and no cure,” the historian David M. Oshinsky &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/04/10/398515228/defeating-the-disease-that-paralyzed-america"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.“Everyone was at risk, especially children. There was nothing a parent could do to protect the family.” Like the outbreak of AIDS in the 1980s, polio’s eruption caused fear because its vectors of transmission were poorly understood, its virulence uncertain, and its repercussions unlike those of other illnesses. Initially, polio was called “infantile paralysis” because it struck mostly children, seemingly at random. The evidence of infection was uniquely visible and visceral compared with that of infectious diseases of the past, too. “It maimed rather than killed,” as Patrick Cockburn &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/polio-the-deadly-summer-of-1956-2117253.html"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;. “Its symbol was less the coffin than the wheelchair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children of the era faced an unenviable lot, whether infected with polio or not. Gerald Shepherd provides a glimpse of the paranoiac atmosphere of the polio scare and its effects on children &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1984/jun/07/polio-years/"&gt;in a firsthand account&lt;/a&gt; of his San Diego childhood in the late 1940s, at the height of the epidemic. Quarantine and seclusion were the most common preventative measures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our parents didn’t know what to do to protect us except to isolate us from other children … One time I stuck my hand through a window and badly cut myself, and despite several stitches and wads of protective bandaging, my father still grounded me that week for fear polio germs might filter in through the sutures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids his age were well aware of what polio could do. “Every time one of our buddies got sick,” Shepherd recollects, “we figured he was headed for the iron lung.” If you caught polio, you would be committed to a hospital with a chance of being forever anchored to a machine. If you didn’t catch it, you would be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future (which, from a child’s perspective, might as well be forever).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a child of the 1940s or ’50s, polio meant the same thing whether you contracted it or not: confinement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milton Bradley executive Mel Taft &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jftapGDTmYUC&amp;amp;pg=PA81&amp;amp;lpg=PA81"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that Abbott, the inventor of Candy Land, was “a real sweetheart” whom he liked immediately. According to Walsh, the toy historian, the two met when Abbott brought Milton Bradley a Candy Land prototype sketched on butcher paper. “Eleanor was just as sweet as could be,” Taft recalled. “She was a schoolteacher who lived in a very modest home in San Diego.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details about her life outside this interaction are scant. Curators at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, say that the museum has no holdings in its extensive archives from Abbott’s records; they rely on Walsh’s account. Walsh told me that Taft was his only source, and Hasbro, which now owns Milton Bradley, did not respond to a request for records that might verify Abbott as the game’s inventor. Among the few facts researchers have unearthed about her: A phone book containing her number &lt;a href="https://www.pacificsandiego.com/misc/pac-sweet-sensation-story.html"&gt;exists in the collections&lt;/a&gt; of the San Diego Historical Society (the only trace of her in its archives). And according to some accounts, she gave much of the royalties she earned from Candy Land to children’s charities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is reason to believe that Abbott was ideally suited to consider polio from a child’s perspective. As a schoolteacher, she would have been acquainted with children’s thoughts and needs. And in 1948, when she was in her late 30s, she herself contracted the disease. Abbott recuperated in the polio ward of a San Diego hospital, spending her convalescence primarily among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine what it must have been like to share an entire hospital ward with children struggling against polio, day after day, as an adult. Kids are poorly equipped to cope with boredom and separation from their loved ones under normal circumstances. But it would be even more unbearable for a child confined to a bed or an iron lung. That was the context in which Abbott made her recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/01/what-america-looked-like-polio-children-paralyzed-in-iron-lungs/251098/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What America looked like: Polio children paralyzed in iron lungs&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seeing children suffer around her, Abbott set out to concoct some escapist entertainment for her young wardmates, a game that left behind the strictures of the hospital ward for an adventure that spoke to their wants: the desire to move freely in the pursuit of delights, an easy privilege polio had stolen from them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From today’s perspective, it’s tempting to see Candy Land as a tool of quarantine, an excuse to keep kids inside in the way Shepherd remembers. The board game gathers all your children in one place, occupying their time and attention. Samira Kawash, a Rutgers University professor, &lt;a href="https://www.journalofplay.org/sites/www.journalofplay.org/files/pdf-articles/3-2-article-polio-comes-home.pdf"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that this is the main way polio informed the game’s development. “The point of Candy Land is to pass the time,” she writes, “certainly a virtue when one’s days are spent in the boring confines of the hospital and an appealing feature as well of a game used to pass the time indoors for children confined to the house.” For Kawash, Candy Land justifies and extends the imprisonment of the hospital, becoming another means of restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the themes of Candy Land tell a different story. Every element of Abbott’s game symbolizes shaking off the polio epidemic’s impositions. And this becomes apparent if you consider the game’s board and mechanics relative to what children in polio wards would have seen and felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="605" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/1114869/2632adc13.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Courtesy of the Strong Museum, Rochester, New York&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, when he was almost 70 years old, the polio survivor Marshall Barr &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878826/"&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; how only brief escapes from the iron lung were possible. The doctors “used to come and say, ‘You can come out for a little while,’ and I used to sit up perhaps to have a cup of tea,” he wrote, “but then they would have to keep an eye on me because my fingers would go blue and in about 15 minutes I would have to go back in again.” Children would have played Abbott’s early version of Candy Land during these breaks, or in their bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walsh reports that kids loved Abbott’s game, and “soon she was encouraged to submit it to Milton Bradley.” In part, anything that would have reduced boredom would have excited kids during treatment. As the historian Daniel J. Wilson &lt;a href="https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo3533692.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, the wards provided little to occupy their young occupants. “In most cases, patients had to find ways to entertain themselves,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/german-board-games-catan/550826/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The invasion of German board games&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tall order. The ward’s setup taxed the imagination. The staff, fellow patients, or radio broadcasts would have been a child’s sole company—only doctors and nurses were allowed in the room. &lt;a href="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2015/04/10/sf25027_sq-0f6b5b41a3919281ad4df2dd7ad6a3fc10621d55-s1600-c85.jpg"&gt;Images of polio wards&lt;/a&gt; depict a geometry even more rigid and sterile than that of typical hospital settings: row upon row of treatment beds and iron lungs. The children lying supine in iron lungs could see only what was on either side of their head (a line of patients telescoping down the ward) or reflected in mirrors mounted overhead (the floor’s tessellation of bleached tiles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candy Land offered a soothing contrast. Repeating tiles line the game’s board, but instead of a uniform, regimented grid, Abbott rearranged them into a meandering rainbow ribbon. Even tracing it with your eyes is stimulating—an especially welcome feature if illness has rendered them the most mobile part of your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="528" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2014/04/AP550816017/65ae90507.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;A polio ward at Haynes Memorial Hospital in Boston in 1955 (Associated Press)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colorful chocolate-and-candy landscape seems like the game’s main attraction, but Candy Land’s play revolves around movement. In theme and execution, the game functions as a mobility fantasy. It simulates a leisurely stroll instead of the studied rigor of therapeutic exercise. And unlike the challenges of physical therapy, movement in Candy Land is so effortless, it’s literally all one can do. Every card drawn either compels you forward or whisks you some distance across the board. Each turn promises either the pleasure of unencumbered travel or the thrill of unexpected flight. The game counters the culture of restriction imposed by both the polio scare and the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/11/board-game-bars/382828/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How board games conquered cafes&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joy of movement, especially for polio patients, seems to have been integral to Abbott’s design philosophy from the start. The &lt;a href="http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/3300000/1949-Original-Candy-Land-Game-candy-land-3327008-580-687.jpg"&gt;original board&lt;/a&gt; even depicts the tentative steps of a boy in a leg brace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game also recognizes that mobility entails autonomy. At least part of Candy Land’s appeal is the feeling of independence it provides its young players. In a backstory printed in the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Candyland,50thAnniversaryEditioninenglishandspanish.PDF"&gt;instruction manual&lt;/a&gt;, the player tokens (in the current edition, four brightly colored plastic gingerbread men) are said to represent the players’ “guides.” They represent the chance to be an active agent, with assistance—an ambulatory adventurer, not a prisoner of the hospital or home. The game may even mark the first time a player feels like a protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat of polio has lessened over time, but Candy Land’s value persists because of what it teaches. This is not to rehash the usual litany of early-childhood skills some Candy Land proponents &lt;a href="https://www.toyhalloffame.org/toys/candy-land"&gt;tout&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the game strengthens pattern recognition. Sure, it can teach children to read and follow instructions. In theory, it shows children how to play together—how to win humbly or lose graciously. But any game can teach these skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candy Land’s lessons are not to be found in the game, but in its results. Now that polio is a distant fear and mobility a power taken for granted, most games of Candy Land disappoint. The rules today are the same as they were in 1949, but something about the proceedings simply does not add up. Eventually, children recognize that they don’t have a hand in winning or losing. The deck chooses for them. An ordained victory is an empty one, without the satisfaction of triumph through skills or smarts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When children want a more challenging experience, they leave Candy Land behind. And that, in the end, is what makes Candy Land priceless: It is designed to be outgrown. Abbott’s game originally taught children, immobilized and separated from family, to envision a world beyond the polio ward, where opportunities for growth and adventure could still materialize. Today that lesson persists more broadly. The game teaches children that all arrangements have their alternatives. It’s the start of learning how to imagine a better world than the one they inherited. As it has done for generations, Candy Land continues to send young children on the first steps of that journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/lLZMWbraoiA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Alexander B.

And to teenagers, it’s a bible. “They have everything you want to know about everyone who is important,” says Grace, a 14-year-old in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Porch, the head of global creative partnerships at Instagram, says that Famous Birthdays is like the younger generation’s &lt;em&gt;Tiger Beat&lt;/em&gt;. “You might know about Famous Birthdays if you’re a parent,” Porch says. “But you definitely know about it if you’re a kid, and you definitely know about it if you’re a creator. Is it adult mainstream yet? No, but that doesn’t matter.” The site has 20 million unique visitors a month—more than a million more than &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/entertainment-weekly-going-monthly-names-new-editor-1216303"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and four times as many as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/teen-vogues-new-editor-is-lindsay-peoples-wagner-of-the-cut"&gt;Teen Vogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The site’s founder, Evan Britton, never set out to build such a site. Back in 2012, he saw the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/02/as-gen-z-balks-at-traditional-tv-content-creators-shift-to-youtube.html"&gt;shift to digital&lt;/a&gt; beginning and recognized an opportunity to build a mobile-first celebrity encyclopedia that could be easily read on a phone. At the time, Wikipedia pages were clunky and poorly formatted, packed with low-quality photos and too much information. So Britton built a simple site and populated it with easy-to-skim stats on stars such as Rihanna, Tom Hanks, and Jennifer Lawrence, hoping the site would become a respectable home for information on A-listers. After about a year, Britton told me, Famous Birthdays reached “1 or 2 million users.” He thought it had peaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But then something strange happened. An increasing number of people weren’t searching for old-guard Hollywood stars. They were navigating to the Famous Birthdays search bar and typing in names like &lt;em&gt;Cameron Dallas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nash Grier&lt;/em&gt;. At first, Britton and his team thought it must be spam. “We were like, &lt;em&gt;Who are these people?&lt;/em&gt;” he said. But they looked into it and realized that they all had huge followings on platforms like YouTube, Vine, and Tumblr. “I realized there was a big gap between who the industry thought was famous and who really had the fame,” Britton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="504" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Screen_Shot_2019_07_24_at_3.58.32_PM/7c355569b.png" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Some of the biggest stars in the internet world on Famous Birthdays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Britton and his small team slowly began building profiles for these new internet stars, often relying on information from the stars themselves—unlike traditional celebrities, influencers were easy to track down. Britton worked with them to set up profiles on Famous Birthdays, complete with preapproved pictures and fact-checked info. The more people he added, the more traffic grew. Teenage fans were happy to finally have a place to get reliable information on their favorite celebrities, and the influencers “were thrilled,” Britton said. “It was a status symbol for them. It was another way to be verified, because these people weren’t on Wikipedia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Britton is thoughtful, earnest, and eager to hear feedback about his site. When we met in his Santa Monica office recently, I was struck by how removed he seems from the flashy world of online influencers. He’s unfazed by the steady stream of stars that visit the office (about three a day), and can talk at length about optimizing for page-load time and the benefits of programmatic ad networks (the primary way Famous Birthdays monetizes). Framed behind his standing desk is an article about user experience and mobile-site design. His personal Instagram account has barely 200 followers and is set to private. “I get about 20 likes per post,” he joked. “I don’t want to be famous. Famous Birthdays is not about me … I don’t need to be here when the celebs come in; I need to make sure the website is fast. I started the website because I’m passionate about [user experience], not celebrity culture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Britton has never employed advertising, marketing, or PR staff, nor has he taken outside funding. But by 2015, Famous Birthdays was so well known in the industry that when Britton brought his 18-person team to VidCon, an annual convention for online-video creators, teenage fans and YouTubers alike kept mentioning the company at events and panels; one of his employees was even accosted by fans while wearing a Famous Birthdays T-shirt in line. The company also began to get flooded with submissions. Because making it on Famous Birthdays was now a badge of honor, fans campaigned hard to get their favorite YouTubers or Instagrammers represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Part of Famous Birthdays’ appeal, aside from the reliable biographical information it provides, is its sophisticated ranking system. Users can contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/trending/"&gt;trending&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/most-popular-people.html"&gt;most popular&lt;/a&gt; rankings by hitting a “boost” button on their favorite star’s profile, or they can see how their favorite stars stack up in various categories. (YouTuber Emma Chamberlain, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/emma-chamberlain.html"&gt;is currently the 33rd-most-popular star on the site&lt;/a&gt;, but the second-most-popular 18-year-old, third-most-popular Gemini, fifth-most-popular star born in California, eighth-most-popular YouTuber, and first-most-popular person born on May 22nd.) Teenage fans are highly invested in these rankings and will swarm an influencer’s page with boosts if their favorite star is slipping. &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Boost Tana Mongeau on Famous Birthdays,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/austinLBBH/status/902671459981635584"&gt;one teen scrawled&lt;/a&gt; on a wall. “Everyone go on famous birthdays &amp;amp; type in Weston Koury and click the ‘boost’ button!!” another teen &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashley_8470/status/688107201458642944"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about the 17-year-old Instagram influencer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;

To ensure that every piece of information about a celebrity is accurate, staffers comb through thousands of tips a day, fact-checking news about stars like &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/matthew-morris.html"&gt;MattyB&lt;/a&gt; breaking up with a girlfriend, or &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/julianna-grace.html"&gt;Annie LeBlanc&lt;/a&gt; launching a new show. Because the site maintains such close relationships with the influencers featured, staff can often confirm information directly to ensure accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="408" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/IMG_4437/8a801b9ee.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Photos of influencers who have visited the Famous Birthdays office line the walls of the company’s headquarters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because of its reliability, managers, agents, and entertainment-industry executives have also come to consider it a crucial resource. “Famous Birthdays has become a valuable tool for our team helping to discover new talent,” says Rob Fishman, the founder of Brat, a Gen Z–focused entertainment company. Britton said that the moment he felt he had made it was when he walked into a meeting with an influencer marketing company that had just been purchased by Disney’s Maker Studios, a multichannel network, and all 10 employees had Famous Birthdays tabs open, scouting talent. When I asked Britton his goal, he said, “I want Famous Birthdays to be a pillar of the internet, where if it goes down, it matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Part of becoming an essential resource means constantly adapting the product to suit his young users’ needs. Three years ago, Famous Birthdays expanded to cover not just individual celebrities, but musical artists, TV shows, web series, and nonhuman celebrities; pet pages include the same rankings as any other star’s, as well as information about the animal’s social graph (who they regularly collaborate with on Instagram or YouTube). The internet-famous Pomeranian &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/jiffpom.html"&gt;JiffPom&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is the 14th-most-famous 9-year-old on the site. (The &lt;em&gt;Dance Moms&lt;/em&gt; star Clara Lukasiak is No. 1.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And of course, the company has expanded into video. Famous Birthdays’ Santa Monica office is outfitted with a studio where top influencers come in to film Q&amp;amp;As and challenge videos for the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=famous+birthdays"&gt;Famous Birthdays YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, which currently has more than 420,000 subscribers. “My goal now is to take Famous Birthdays and spread it wherever we can,” Britton said. “We are awesome on the web. Our iOS and Android app is great. Now we’re on YouTube, Instagram. As we see other platforms rise, we will see where we can add value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“[Teenagers today], they live on these platforms,” Britton said. “TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, it’s like their ABC, CBS, and MTV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/t_33HqDo6cA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Taylor Lorenz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/taylor-lorenz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/IMG_4491/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Taylor Lorenz</media:credit><media:description>The YouTube stars Ryan Prunty, Lizzy Chang, Stove's Kitchen, and Carter Sharer pose at the Famous Birthdays office.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">A Wikipedia for Generation Z</title><published>2019-07-25T12:01:09-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-25T14:50:33-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Famous Birthdays has become a go-to database of teen culture—and is ushering in a whole new generation of stars.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/t_33HqDo6cA/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/famous-birthdays-wikipedia-gen-z/594682/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594361</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When you’re mad at “the man,” it’s easier to direct your anger at an actual person: parents, bankers, lawyers, and so on. When you’re heartbroken at how systemic inequality leaves people clinging to the edges of society lest they fall off forever, you may donate a few dollars to a homeless person. And when you’re mad about the tightening noose of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/crazygenius-season-three-privacy-internet/589078/?utm_source=feed"&gt;surveillance capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, fastened so snugly around daily life that even our toilets are hackable and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/universities-record-students-campuses-research/592537/?utm_source=feed"&gt;walking outside means you risk&lt;/a&gt; appearing in a database, you get mad at FaceApp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The backlash against FaceApp, which uses artificial intelligence to apply a filter that ages users’ selfies by 50 years, has nearly kept apace with its viral popularity. Just as Drake, Steph Curry, and Cardi B were &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/celebrity-faceapp-age-viral-trend.html"&gt;posting their own aged selfies&lt;/a&gt;, journalists and researchers were noting that Wireless Lab, FaceApp’s maker, is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/17/you-downloaded-faceapp-heres-what-youve-just-done-your-privacy/?utm_term=.86b87de7dae4"&gt;headquartered&lt;/a&gt; in St. Petersburg, Russia. As millions shared their photos to Facebook and Instagram, researchers continued to ring alarm bells about how the app’s privacy policy grants “perpetual” access to photos, including photo uploads of friends or family, regardless of whether these people agreed to the app’s terms of use. And by the time Wireless Lab CEO Yaroslav Goncharov &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/17/you-downloaded-faceapp-heres-what-youve-just-done-your-privacy/?utm_term=.777f4cd21d45"&gt;defended the app&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was calling for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/politics/chuck-schumer-faceapp-investigation/index.html"&gt;an FBI investigation&lt;/a&gt; into its data-usage policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; reached out for comment to FaceApp, but did not receive a reply by the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In three days, FaceApp has gone from a frivolous novelty to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-security-concerns-russians-now-own-all-your-old-photos/"&gt;a frightening symbol &lt;/a&gt;of our privacy frustrations: Even banal apps &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/technology/kids-apps-data-privacy-google-twitter.html"&gt;spy on users&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/sfiegerman/status/1151499378152169472"&gt;no one&lt;/a&gt; listens to privacy experts, users give away sensitive information &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jessicacoen/status/1151498722452344832"&gt;too readily&lt;/a&gt;, and recent history repeats itself. Two years ago, Meitu, a Chinese beauty app, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/meitu-viral-anime-makeover-app-major-privacy-red-flags/"&gt;went viral&lt;/a&gt; as it collected a trove of faces with a similarly dubious privacy policy. But whether it’s Meitu or FaceApp, singling out individual viral trends is no different from shaking a fist at a banker when you’re mad at capitalism: We direct our ire at one another, and the noose continues to tighten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/ever-strava-ai-human-ignorance/589306/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The AI supply chain runs on ignorance&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Think of these callouts as a mantra someone afraid of flying says during takeoff. Calling out users for not worrying about privacy when they use these misleading apps lets naysayers pretend their worrying matters. The United States &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2019/01/26/government-efforts-to-regulate-big-tech-will-likely-backfire-heres-why/#6c1aebe2318c"&gt;has yet to &lt;/a&gt;regulate big companies on its own turf, let alone Russia, but if more people felt the grip of omnisurveillance, the thinking goes, we might be able to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is a silly blame game and a distraction. FaceApp is not just FaceApp’s fault. Data collection is the plumbing of the modern web, and FaceApp is but one of millions of pipes. The app was vetted by Apple’s App Store and even labeled “Editors Choice” in the Google Play store. Google directly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/swodinsky/status/1151324194346622976"&gt;receives data from FaceApp&lt;/a&gt;, an examination of its trackers show, as does Facebook. In fact, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/faceapp-privacy-backlash-facebook/"&gt;draws a direct line&lt;/a&gt; from FaceApp’s terms of service—which grants it “perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable [and] sub-licensable” access to your photos—and Facebook’s, which “grant[s] a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license.” What are FaceApp’s estimated 80 million users compared with Facebook’s more than 2 billion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;FaceApp’s scale is what’s most dangerous about it. The repercussions go above and beyond even its exploding user base. While 80 million people have said yes to the app, countless more will face consequences if the data are misused. Consider one scenario: A bad actor uses the uploaded photos to summon a bot army pushing misinformation on social media, all with profile photos pulled from FaceApp’s servers. This wouldn’t even require FaceApp to be a malicious actor; it could be hacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When you download FaceApp or Meitu, you’re asked a piecemeal series of questions, carefully framed to shift responsibility away from corporate actors and onto the user: &lt;em&gt;Do you consent to having your photo taken? Do you permit access to your device and to your photos?&lt;/em&gt; Privacy policies always frame the terms of service as personal consumer choices. Yes, the choice to download and upload is yours, but the ramifications are far-reaching. Data collected for one purpose can always be used for another. Some of the worst misuses of face data come from one bad actor seizing on thousands of people who, as far as they knew, agreed to take on the responsibility themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In May, the news came out that Ever, a photo-album app, used vacation photos and users’ selfies to enhance the computer-vision software used in the Department of Defense’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/ever-strava-ai-human-ignorance/589306/?utm_source=feed"&gt;military drones&lt;/a&gt;. Clarifai, a computer-vision start-up, scraped profile pictures &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/technology/databases-faces-facial-recognition-technology.html"&gt;from the dating site OKCupid&lt;/a&gt;’s apps to build services that infer race and sex from detected faces. It also partnered with the military. Stanford researchers similarly tapped an &lt;a href="http://qz.com/1078901/a-stanford-scientist-says-he-built-a-gaydar-using-the-lamest-ai-to-prove-a-point/"&gt;undisclosed US dating website&lt;/a&gt; to see if they could predict people’s sexual orientation from their face. Goncharov, FaceApp’s CEO, told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; the company “doesn’t sell or share any user data with any third parties,” but again, FaceApp reserves the right to keep the photos forever. From drone targeting to potentially outing unsuspecting strangers, individual decisions can’t account for what happens when data is wielded at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/universities-record-students-campuses-research/592537/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: You no longer own your face&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Earlier this year, my colleague Derek Thompson wrote that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/crazygenius-season-three-privacy-internet/589078/?utm_source=feed"&gt;climate change is a metaphor for privacy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s especially fitting here. If enough people individually choose plastic and gas-guzzling cars, we will all be left with warming seas and noxious air. If enough people individually decide that a goofy selfie is worth the risk to their own privacy, we’re all at risk of invasive targeting, omnisurveillance, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Trying to individually blame each person who uses FaceApp as contributing to this is a bit like going to a landfill and trying to assign each piece of trash to a single household. Privacy, when framed as something a single individual consents to, obscures a bleak fact of life: You can’t always opt out of other people’s choices. The FaceApp backlash exposes the fallacy at the core of climate change, technology, and most of life. We have much less control than we think we do, especially when it comes to how other people behave. FaceApp is everyone’s problem, but its viral use is nobody’s fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/qbz5lIZJ4j4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Sidney Fussell</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sidney-fussell/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_1156206251/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Kirill Kudryatvsev / AFP / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">FaceApp Is Everyone’s Problem</title><published>2019-07-19T11:04:08-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-19T15:23:35-04:00</updated><summary type="html">It feels good to call out people for being duped by the Russian app, but the individualist framing of privacy is the bigger culprit.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/qbz5lIZJ4j4/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/faceapp-mess/594361/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594199</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The owner of a coffee shop approaches you with a $10 bill in hand. It’s yours if you submit to a battery of questions: How did you hear about the shop? How did you get here? Did you walk or take an Uber? They’re simple-enough questions with simple-enough answers. Of course you take the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Repeat this same thought experiment again, online: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos approaches you while you browse, offering you $10 for access to your search history so that the company can find out more about how you shop. In that case, you might have a different reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Amazon’s Prime Day bonanza came with an interesting deal: If users downloaded the Amazon Assistant app to their browser, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-prime-day/amazon-offers-10-to-prime-day-shoppers-who-hand-over-their-data-idUSKCN1UB164"&gt;they would receive a $10 credit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Amazon Assistant is a browser extension, shopping assistant, and recommendation tool, all rolled into one. Hover over an item while you’re shopping on another site, and the assistant will compare the item you’re looking at with a similar one available on Amazon. Of course, when Amazon has the cheaper deal, users will likely choose that one instead. But the assistant also allows Amazon access to users’ browser data: the URLs of the pages they visit, the search terms that brought them there, search results and metadata about those pages. Amazon offered the exchange last year as well, for a $5 credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Amazon said that the company values consumer privacy and that the assistant is completely optional. “The use of Amazon Assistant will always comply with our &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=footer_privacy?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;nodeId=468496"&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt; and About &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/BIT/TOU"&gt;Amazon Assistant Privacy&lt;/a&gt; notice. Amazon only collects information from websites customers view where we may have relevant product or service recommendations. We do not connect this information to a customer’s Amazon account, except when they interact with Amazon Assistant,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In an additional statement provided after publication of this article, Amazon clarified that the Assistant does not collect personally identifying information from users.  “Product or price data automatically collected by Amazon Assistant is not connected to any customer identifiers,” the statement reads. “We do not use Amazon Assistant information in our advertising business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When people talk about “buying” and “selling” data, they’re usually using a shorthand for any number of convoluted algorithmic processes by which big companies profit from user behavior. This is an imprecise metaphor, and companies tend to chafe at it: Amazon’s privacy notice claims that the company is “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496"&gt;not in the business of selling&lt;/a&gt;” user data, and Mark Zuckerberg says the same of Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/14/18140146/does-facebook-sell-data-debate-volume-infinity"&gt;so often&lt;/a&gt; that it’s become something of a running joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Both corporations are technically correct. They do not sell user information to third parties—they just generate large chunks of their revenue from using that information to sell targeted advertising. Data and money exchange hands, though not directly, and with many more actors involved than just the user and the company. It doesn’t have to actually buy or sell user data to profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And besides, these data were never really yours, not exclusively. Google (or Bing or Yahoo) knows the search terms and keystrokes that led to any specific purchase. Amazon isn’t really “buying” data that you “own,” but paying for access to a data vein that other companies are already tapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The data exchange isn’t a typical marketplace, and it can’t be understood as such. People don’t “own” their data. Nor does Facebook or Amazon exactly “buy” or “sell” it. They gather as much as they can as an indirect but potent revenue-generating strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For Amazon, the assistant credit isn’t a purchase; it’s an investment. The company is giving you a small amount of money now because, in the future, it will make much more from you. Amazon will use your purchasing data to improve its targeting, slicing its enormous user base into &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/alexa-emotion-detection-ai-surveillance/572884/?utm_source=feed"&gt;ever more refined categories&lt;/a&gt; that can then be targeted ever more specifically.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That’s what Amazon is actually “buying” here: the raw materials to supercharge its targeting. Long term, it’s likely to pay dividends: Imagine logging on to Amazon and immediately being served suggestions for products in your precise size, price range, and favorite style. Now imagine that at the scale Amazon is collecting these extra data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a one-sided deal. Investing in better ad targeting doesn’t come with a concurrent investment in strengthening privacy, or in the ability to shop anonymously or be free from enhanced predictive recommendation algorithms. In fact, investing in one means losing the others. The right to privacy can’t be bought back, but it can be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/Ctb7lpIMQY0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Sidney Fussell</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sidney-fussell/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/AP_18269742580292/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Mark Lennihan / AP</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">What Amazon Thinks You’re Worth</title><published>2019-07-18T12:27:48-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-19T16:53:19-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Shoppers were offered a $10 credit in exchange for handing over their browser data.

Painted a handsome navy blue, your truck has just enough rear space to haul something rugged and earthy-smelling—like a Christmas tree or a nice pile of mulch—and a front cab just big enough for you and your golden retriever. You sit there and drive, and Ezekiel hangs his head out the window (Ezekiel is your dog), and the mulch steams in the golden-hour light, and you drive somewhere pretty, like Acadia National Park or the Louvre. Then you get out and look around and sniff deeply of your mulch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Normally, an experience like that might cost you tens of thousands of dollars. But soon it will be free, provided you are content to drive the information superhighway. Next year, at long last, the most popular type of vehicle in the United States will come to smartphones everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The world is getting a pickup-truck emoji.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ford Motor Company sponsored the emoji’s design and proposal, and finds the occasion worth celebrating. The pickup truck has long been the “the most overlooked missing emoji,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/matt-vandyke.html" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;Matt VanDyke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Ford’s director of marketing, told me this week. And the lack of a pickup emoji has been “a personal point of anger” for the company’s truck team for years, he said. “&lt;/span&gt;We can’t believe there’s scooter emojis when there’s not pickup-truck emojis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now Ford is celebrating the debut &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umv1tCTkLa4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;with an online video&lt;/a&gt; narrated by Bryan Cranston and a campaign that cost the automaker upward of $50,000. And while that&lt;/span&gt; may be a drop in the bucket for a company the size of Ford—it &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/article/20160628/RETAIL03/160629852/automakers-rank-high-on-annual-ad-spending-list"&gt;spends more than $2.5 billion annually on advertising&lt;/a&gt;—the amount reveals how emoji have become a ubiquitous marketing tool. Your smartphone’s keyboard is yet another digital platform where brands, businesses, and product segments must compete for attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new emoji, or at least its reference image, is clearly a Ford. It looks to be about the size of a midsize Ford Ranger, but its headlights lean forward like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_F-Series_twelfth_generation"&gt;an old F-150&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span&gt;“We kind of tried to make it look like it could be both,” VanDyke said. It also has only one row of seats, even though most new pickups sold today are de facto minivans and have two. “Even most of our pickups are sold as double-cab pickups, but the traditional iconography of pickups is single cab. So we tried to stay true to that,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the pickup-truck proposal was provisionally approved &lt;a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/future/emoji-provisional.html"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;, Ford did not publicize its rollout until today, which happens to be World Emoji Day, a very silly &lt;a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/its-world-emoji-day-how-9680218"&gt;five-year-old&lt;/a&gt; holiday observed mostly by corporations. The announcement will sate fans such as the actor Dwayne Johnson. The granitic pro wrestler and former Ford pitchman has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/therock/status/737584984915988482"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Atherock%20truck%20emoji&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt; half a dozen times&lt;/a&gt; about his desire for a pickup emoji. But it also raises questions about who can influence emoji, a set of pictograms used by billions of people around the world everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/how-new-emoji-are-changing-pictorial-language/582400/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Emoji don’t mean what they used to&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emoji are overseen by the Unicode Consortium, a 28-year-old technical organization that governs the global standard for computer text. Unicode is ubiquitous: The letters you are reading right now only look like letters because the engineers who made both of our computers agreed to follow the Unicode standard. For most of its existence, the Unicode Consortium was mostly ignored by average computer users, &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-debate-surrounding-Han-Unification-in-Unicode-What-were-the-arguments-from-both-sides"&gt;even when it stumbled into controversy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2007, engineers at Google began working to render emoji—which had previously flourished only on Japanese phones—within the international Unicode standard. It was soon possible to type emoji on both Google- and Apple-made smartphones. By the mid-2010s, the once-sleepy Unicode Consortium &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/emoji-are-tearing-the-unicode-consortium-apart.html"&gt;found itself in charge of a global phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So began the bonanza to make emoji—which had always borne the imprint of their Japanese manufacturing (there were always sushi emoji, and a lot of trains)—look more like the rest of the world. The taco, burrito, and mosque emoji all &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/and-lo-a-taco-emoji-appeared-among-them/382899/?utm_source=feed"&gt;debuted in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Emoji with black or brown skin &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/finally-emoji-people-of-color/385843/?utm_source=feed"&gt;followed&lt;/a&gt; the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Ford pitched the Unicode Consortium on a pickup-truck emoji. Its proposal was declined. But Ford tried again last summer after working with &lt;a href="https://www.gtb.com/DET"&gt;the marketing firm GTB&lt;/a&gt; and the creative agency &lt;a href="https://www.bluestate.co/"&gt;Blue State&lt;/a&gt;, according to VanDyke. That pitch was provisionally approved by Unicode’s emoji subcommittee a few months ago. “But it still has to get a final blessing,” VanDyke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitch drew on the pickup’s intensely masculine vibes. “The associations of working class, hard work, and toughness are not currently associated with any of the vehicles that exist,” in emoji, it said. Emoji, the argument seemed to be, were made for pixel pushers at the expense of earthmovers. (When asked, VanDyke said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he does not believe emoji have a pro-urban bias.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jennifer8lee.com/"&gt;Jennifer 8. Lee&lt;/a&gt;, a vice chair of the Unicode emoji subcommittee, told me by text message that the pickup-truck proposal was impressive. There was only one wrinkle, she said: She didn’t know Ford was behind it. While &lt;a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18260-pickup-truck-emoji.pdf"&gt;the proposal&lt;/a&gt; was designed like a Ford corporate PowerPoint, it does not include the Ford logo or mention that Ford underwrote its creation. Instead, it says it was written by &lt;a href="https://nathanmaggio.com/"&gt;Nathan Maggio&lt;/a&gt;, then a creative director for Blue State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sponsorship “probably should have been disclosed,” Lee said. Other emoji proposals from corporations, such as those from Durex and &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/give-us-break-now-kit-kat-petitioning-emoji/"&gt;Kit Kat&lt;/a&gt;, have noted their sponsor, she said, and Ford and Blue State should have done the same. “Some transparency would be nice,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the lack of disclosure probably would not jeopardize the pickup emoji, she added. “It was a solid proposal,” she told me. “Companies and their agencies usually have terrible proposals and I remember [the pickup truck’s] being very good.” In a statement, a Blue State spokesman confirmed Ford was a client and that Blue State “submitted the proposal as part of the work and services we offer.” The firm has not pitched other emoji to the Unicode Consortium, he said. (Maggio, who has since left Blue State to work on a presidential campaign, did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those corporate efforts, generally speaking, emoji are not a high-margin business, Lee said. She volunteers for the Unicode Consortium, and she has not directly benefited from her successful efforts to create dumpling and hijab emoji. “People sometimes ask if I get royalties for the dumpling emoji and I’m like &#x1f644;,” she said by text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the pickup emoji is barreling down the road to completion. If all goes according to plan, it will be available on iPhones and Androids next June, &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/unicode-13.0/"&gt;along with new emoji for houseplants, bubble tea, and tamales&lt;/a&gt;. They will join the &lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/auto-rickshaw/"&gt;tuk tuk&lt;/a&gt; and motorized-wheelchair emoji, two new transport pictograms set to debut this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VanDyke is psyched. He anticipates the truck emoji being used alongside the bicep emoji, the knuckles emoji, and—of course—the ❤️. “In country music, if you didn’t have trucks, the songs would only be about beer and broken hearts,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/I7ZkJBW46Y8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/pickup_truck_emoji_01/lead_960.png"><media:credit>Ford / Unicode Consortium / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The World Is Getting a Pickup-Truck Emoji</title><published>2019-07-17T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-17T16:40:52-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Thanks to Ford</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/I7ZkJBW46Y8/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/pickup-truck-emoji-will-debut-2020/594172/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594121</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary?utm_source=feed"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Without the computers on board the Apollo spacecraft, there would have been no moon landing, no triumphant first step, no high-water mark for human space travel. A pilot could never have navigated the way to the moon, as if a spaceship were simply a more powerful airplane. The calculations required to make in-flight adjustments and the complexity of the thrust controls outstripped human capacities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Apollo Guidance Computer, in both its guises—one on board the core spacecraft, and the other on the lunar module—was a triumph of engineering. Computers had been the size of rooms and filled with vacuum tubes, and if the Apollo computer, at 70 pounds, was not exactly miniature yet, it began “the transition between people bragging about how big their computers are … and bragging about how small their computers are,” the MIT aerospace and computing &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/bh/podcast/lecture-10-aerospace-computing-in-1960s-lab-life-in/id556575718?i=1000345470856"&gt;historian David Mindell once joked in a lecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The trends that this computer foretold kept spinning out, exponentially, for decades: From big to small, from vacuum tubes to silicon, from hardware to software. Now, if you compare the computing power that NASA used with any common device, from a watch to a greeting card to a microwave, it induces technological vertigo. Michio Kaku, the physicist and popular author, put it like this: “Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But these just-so sayings obscure the real power of the Apollo computer. Of course, any contemporary device has vastly more raw computational ability than the early machine, but the Apollo computer was remarkably &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt;, reliable, and up to the task it was given. You could not actually guide a spaceship to the moon with a smart doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/moon-landing-50-years-later/593803/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What will the moon landing mean to the future?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To understand how significant the Apollo system was, and why its tiny amount of raw processing power is irrelevant, you only have to listen to the OG computer programmer and volunteer NASA historian Frank O’Brien, who has spent his life lovingly detailing the functions of the Apollo Guidance Computer. O’Brien’s father was a pilot, so Frank became a military brat. He was interested in computers from an early age, and when &lt;a href="https://engineering.unl.edu/engineering-alum-and-nasa-space-flight-team-member-oneill-dies/"&gt;one of his dad’s old friends&lt;/a&gt; rose up the ranks at NASA, he came into possession of the technical manuals that governed the operation of the computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“At 13 years old, I get a box on Christmas, around two feet on a side, weighed a million pounds,” O’Brien told me. “I open it up, and it had all the technical manuals on Apollo. You had tons and tons of kids looking at &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;s; I was reading about guidance computers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since then, he’s spent countless hours learning precisely how these machines worked. Even as a teenager, he could fly NASA’s Apollo simulator. As an adult, after earning a computer-science degree and working a long stint as a corporate programmer, he wrote the book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Guidance-Computer-Architecture-Operation/dp/1441908765"&gt;The Apollo Guidance Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, an ode to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Apollo Guidance Computer in the command module had two main jobs. First, it computed the necessary course to the moon, calibrated by astronomical measurements that the astronauts made in flight, with a sextant not unlike that used by oceanic navigators. They’d line up the moon, Earth, or the sun in one sight, and fix the location of a star with the other. The computer would precisely measure those angles and recalculate its position. Second, it controlled the many physical components of the spacecraft. The AGC could communicate with 150 different devices within the spacecraft—an enormously complicated task. “It has dozens of thrusters and all kinds of interfaces and a guidance platform and the sextant,” O’Brien said. “You start adding up all this stuff and go, &lt;em&gt;Holy cannoli. &lt;/em&gt;This&lt;em&gt; is really capable&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Conceptually, the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which designed the system, built it atop the work they’d done for the Polaris guided-missile system, made to launch nuclear weapons from American submarines. The Apollo computer's hardware, as Mindell has noted, was fairly well understood “in the world of military avionics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Building it dominated the project at first—the lab heavily underestimated the complexity of the software-engineering task. For years afterward, deep into the 1970s, programmers were still using punch cards to code. But the necessity of having Apollo astronauts and NASA engineers “in the loop,” making decisions, required a different kind of software. There had to be an interface. Multiple operations had to run at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/omega-speedmaster-watch-went-moon/594052/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The watch that went to the moon&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The initial focus on hardware locked in what O’Brien called a “primitive architecture” while opening space for Margaret Hamilton, a woman in the heavily male Apollo program, to lead software design. As it became clear that the software was truly where the mission would be made, Hamilton’s team expanded to 350 people at its peak. The system they built was remarkably advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To maximize the built-in architecture, Hamilton and her colleagues came up with what they named “The Interpreter”—we’d now call it a virtualization scheme. It allowed them to run five to seven virtual machines simultaneously in two kilobytes of memory. It was terribly slow, but “now you have all the capabilities you ever dreamed of, in software,” O’Brien said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The astronauts communicated with the computer through the DSKY, short for “display and keyboard.” They’d punch in numbers and get responses. It’s not easy to describe the user-interface system, but it relied on a series of program codes, as well as “verb” and “noun” codes. Verbs were things the computer could do (“78 UPDATE PRELAUNCH AZIMUTH”). Nouns were numerical quantities or measurements (“33 TIME OF IGNITION”). It was a long way from point-and-click simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most of the system’s memory had been woven, literally, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BlivdwXRZU"&gt;onto rope memory&lt;/a&gt;, but some could be written, both by the astronauts and remotely from Mission Control. Perhaps the most brilliant software-engineering feat was the software designed by J. Halcombe Laning that prioritized the system’s computational tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This turned out to be a mission-saving advance for Apollo 11. As the lunar module descended, noise from one of its radars began to feed bad data into the system. The guidance computer understood it had a problem, but was able to stay functional throughout the descent, dumping the bad information and continuing its more important operations, saving the mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The popular narrative of this moment—at the time and still today—holds that the computer had problems and that Neil Armstrong, seizing “manual” control, piloted the spacecraft to the moon’s surface. Humans did it! Computers are no match for us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the lunar lander was a fly-by-wire system. Any command that Armstrong gave had to route through the computer. So it’s probably more accurate to say that when Armstrong landed on the moon, he told the computer where to touch down. There was no usable manual control; the real triumph was the flexibility of human-computer interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Historians such as Mindell, who has modeled the descent on a second-by-second basis, don’t put much stock in the necessity of Armstrong’s actions. He still needed the computer to control the craft. “Had it been set on automatic landing, the [lunar module] would have come down anyhow, with less ballyhoo, though perhaps amid a field of boulders,” Mindell concluded. The story about human prowess was almost a perfect reversal of the reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Given all this, perhaps it’s not surprising that O’Brien takes umbrage at the idea that a microwave or calculator could be considered “as powerful” as the Apollo computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“How do you define &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;?” O’Brien asks. “It’s great to say, ‘This machine is so powerful.’ What do you mean by that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For him, it’s not about the raw number of transistors, but the machine fitting the mission. Capability, not power. “We had to get to the moon, get down, and get back, autonomously. They hit their targets of being accurate after a quarter million miles, hitting a target within 500 to 600 feet and one-tenth of a foot a second,” O’Brien said. “And you go, ‘My watch is more powerful.’ No, it is not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The lesson, maybe, is simple: If your phone is so much more powerful than the computers that put humanity on the moon, then why are you just staring at Instagram all day? Computation is means, not end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/4N14MeboYKg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis C.

It is &lt;a href="https://www.fratellowatches.com/omega-speedmaster-it-is-39-years-ago/"&gt;instantly recognizable&lt;/a&gt;: Buzz Aldrin sits inside a capsule, insouciantly staring into the camera. His hair is closely cropped, his left arm is raised across his chest, and on his wrist is a watch, with a black strap, black dial, and white hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That watch, the Omega Speedmaster Professional—also known as the Moonwatch—retails on the Omega website for $5,350, and has the words &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;The First Watch Worn on the Moon&lt;/span&gt; engraved on the case back, along with the reminder that the Speedmaster is &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Flight-Qualified by NASA For All Manned Space Missions&lt;/span&gt;. It is the only watch to have earned that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few thousand dollars for a watch might seem like a lot of money—and it is—but wearing a NASA-approved Speedmaster is the closest many of us will ever come to actual space travel, which is surely part of the reason for its enduring appeal. The model arguably helped Omega survive the “quartz crisis” of the 1980s—a disaster discussed by watch aficionados with the same intensity southern farmers might the boll weevil infestation of the 1920s—when quartz crystal-powered watches brought inexpensive timekeeping to the masses, effectively killing many storied Swiss watch companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other brands, like Omega, that previously made relatively affordable watches survived by catering to the wealthy. The Speedmaster—a “mechanical” watch, meaning it is powered by a mechanism—remains one of the most popular Swiss watches around. Besides telling time, it has a chronograph, which basically means it can also work as a stopwatch, and a tachymeter, which measures speed. It also looks remarkably, to use a technical term, cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that people still buy watches—let alone ones that cost thousands of dollars—shouldn’t make sense. The wristwatch should have gone the way of the astrolabe, the astrarium, and the gramophone. The mechanical watch works much as it has for more than a century, but now it is surrounded by cheaper and more accurate alternatives. After all, a cellphone keeps time, too; a $400 Apple Watch keeps time and measures heart rate, and makes calls; and a $30 quartz timepiece from Target tells time with greater precision than a mechanical watch. The mechanical watch should be an anachronism. And &lt;a href="https://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/the-continued-polarisation-of-the-swiss-watch-market/"&gt;yet it is not&lt;/a&gt;. Far from it—if &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?term=swiss+watches&amp;amp;sort=most_funded"&gt;successful funding efforts&lt;/a&gt; on Kickstarter are a measure. In January, Swatch, Omega’s parent company, &lt;a href="https://www.swatchgroup.com/sites/default/files/media-files/pr_key_figures_en_2018.pdf"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that in 2018, its strongest sales growth was among brands such as Blancpain, Omega, and Longines, which are part of its “prestige and luxury range.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In this era of disposable technology, people want things that last,” Paul Boutros, the head of Americas for Watches at the auction house Phillips, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Speedmaster and watches like it provide a sense of permanence in an age with little of it. The Speedmaster available today is virtually the same as the one Aldrin wore on the moon, or indeed the one Omega introduced way back in 1957, as a tool for race-car drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is unchanged because there’s nothing &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; change: The mechanical watch is, along with the bicycle, an arguably perfect invention. If wound every day and serviced regularly, it can run for perpetuity. There aren’t many things you can say that about in our era of fast fashion and biennial phone upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the lingering appeal is atavistic: Humanity’s desire to record the passage of time possibly dates back to the age when people cowered after sunset in the seeming permanence of darkness. Ancient Egyptians &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/28057-ancient-egyptian-sundial-discovered.html"&gt;used the sundial&lt;/a&gt; more than 1,000 years before Christ. The Ancient Greeks &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160932779900073"&gt;used water clocks&lt;/a&gt;; the hourglass has been around since &lt;a href="http://www.tkyoung.com/history.html"&gt;at least the Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. The first modern clock, the kind we’d recognize, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-chronicle-of-timekeeping-2006-02/"&gt;was invented &lt;/a&gt;in the 15th century. Its mechanism was such a wonder that the Founding Fathers&lt;a href="https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/jeffersons-religious-beliefs#footnote23_bgto2eh"&gt; even likened&lt;/a&gt; God to a clockmaker, who, having created the world, was cheerfully absent as it functioned. And in the 1962 speech that launched the American conquest of the moon, President John F. Kennedy held up the watch as the exemplar of technological sophistication: The rocket that would go to the moon, he told the crowd at Rice University, would be “fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch.” It was—and the men inside relied on the Speedmaster, to do more than tell time.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The watches … held deep significance” for the astronauts, given that time was so crucial for everything they did, Jennifer Levasseur, who is a curator of chronographs at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, where the astronauts’ Speedmasters and other NASA memorabilia are housed, told me in a recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in 1970 when the oxygen tank on Apollo 13 exploded, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2015/05/20/the-omega-speedmasters-14-seconds-of-fame/#7118c9b529b5"&gt;astronauts used&lt;/a&gt; the Speedmaster’s chronograph function to time a crucial 14-second maneuver that allowed them to return to Earth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Staky, a watch enthusiast who collects Speedmasters and runs the watch website Bazamu, told me he uses the chronograph on his Speedmaster for more prosaic functions: to time everything from his morning commute to how long it takes to toast his bagel. “It’s a perfect machine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Speedmaster is not Omega’s only watch model, but it is its most historically iconic—a fact the watchmaker has capitalized on. Over the past 50 years, it has issued &lt;a href="https://watchbase.com/omega/speedmaster/522-30-42-30-06-001"&gt;so many commemorative Moonwatches&lt;/a&gt; that the strategy has almost become a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/5n4ieq/omega_another_limited_edition_speedmaster_speedy/"&gt;joke&lt;/a&gt; in the watch-collecting community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hasn’t hurt sales: Recent special edition Speedmasters priced in the five-figure range &lt;a href="https://www.fratellowatches.com/speedy-tuesday-omega-speedmaster-50th-anniversary-patch-311-30-42-30-01-001/"&gt;sold out in hours&lt;/a&gt;. Those pieces regularly appear on auction websites with substantial markups. Omega released two special editions to mark the 50th anniversary of the moon landing—one of them in gold (&lt;a href="https://www.omegawatches.com/en-us/watches/speedmaster/moonwatch/apollo-11-50-th-anniversary-moonshine/catalog"&gt;yours for only $34,600&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staky said the watch’s history is alluring to watch obsessives like him who take pleasure in being able to tell the subtle differences in the Speedmaster’s design since the 1950s. At the same time, he said, it also appeals to those casually looking for a new watch. “For the guy who wants his first watch, and will probably not buy another one, it’s the best everyday watch,” he told me. “It’s versatile. You can wear it with a suit and with jeans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A guy has only so many ways to communicate what he’s about,” Staky added. “The Speedmaster says something about the person wearing it. It’s understated and appreciated by those in the know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are, of course, talking about a tiny subset of people. After all, many car enthusiasts only admire the Porsche 356 from afar, and many art lovers only see the Dutch masters at museums. And when I asked the Smithsonian’s Levassuer whether she, because of her interest in the watches, wears a Speedmaster, she told me that doing so would be a conflict of interest, citing the Smithsonian’s rules. So what does she wear to tell time? “A Fitbit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/39ckqGkWfOY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Krishnadev Calamur</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/krishnadev-calamur/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/as11_36_5390_orig/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>NASA</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Watch That Went to the Moon</title><published>2019-07-16T11:01:43-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-18T07:31:53-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Fifty years ago, Buzz Aldrin wore his Omega Speedmaster Professional on the lunar surface.

The roads you drive on. The rigs and refineries that turn fossil fuel into the gas that makes your car go. The electricity that powers the streetlights and lamps that guide your way. All these technologies vanish into the oblivion of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until they break. Then everyone notices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened Saturday night in New York City when a power outage struck Midtown Manhattan, from Hell’s Kitchen north to Lincoln Center and from Fifth Avenue west to the Hudson River. The blackout darkened the huge, electric billboards of Times Square, forced Broadway shows to cancel performances, and even disabled some subway lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/power-outage-new-york-affects-rockefeller-center-1224209"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, the outage was caused by a transformer fire within the affected region. Power was fully restored by early the following morning. It was not the first or the most severe blackout to hit the Big Apple—another took out the whole city &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/nyregion/1977-blackout-photos.html"&gt;on the same date&lt;/a&gt; in 1977, and yet another struck in the summer of 2003. The causes vary—a series of lightning strikes instigated the 1977 event, and a remote software error caused the one in 2003. But deferred maintenance, increased demand, climate-change-driven weather calamities, and even the threat of cyberattack put infrastructure at greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick primer on how electricity works: First, power plants create it, mostly by burning fuel (or smashing atoms) that heats water to make steam that spins a turbine. (Hydroelectric generators harness the flow of water to spin turbines directly.) Those turbines move a generator, which produces electricity from the resulting kinetic energy. Plants then use transformers to step up the voltage of generated electricity and send it down high-voltage lines, which lose less energy in transit. Once it reaches its destination, other transformers step the voltage down to deliver it to substations, and eventually directly to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s blackout was most likely caused by a disabled transformer at an area substation. There are &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/sirr/downloads/pdf/Ch_6_Utilities_FINAL_singles.pdf"&gt;at least&lt;/a&gt; 50 of those in New York City, which are fed in turn by at least 24, higher-voltage transmission substations. When it comes to power, New York is unusual because of the city’s age and the density of its population, both residential and commercial. That produces different risks and consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Atlanta, where I live, storms often down trees, which take out aboveground power lines. In the West, where wildfires are becoming more common, flames frequently dismantle power infrastructure (&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/power-lines-are-burning-the-west/561212/?utm_source=feed"&gt;sometimes the power lines themselves cause the fires&lt;/a&gt;). But across the whole of New York City—not just Manhattan—more than 80 percent of both customers and the electrical load are serviced by underground distribution from area substations. That makes smaller problems less frequent, but bigger issues more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a transformer goes down in a populous place like Manhattan, it has a greater impact than it would on Long Island, say, or in Westchester County, where density is lower. The amount of power that central Manhattan uses on a regular basis also contributes to that impact. Times Square, the theater district, hundreds of skyscrapers—it’s a substantial load. In New York’s case, supplying that load is not usually the problem. Generating facilities can be located near or far away from where their power is used, and New York City draws power from a couple dozen plants. Some of it is imported from upstate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much of New York’s power is still generated locally, in large part at plants along the waterfront of Queens. Those plants are older, and more susceptible to disruption from local calamities, especially severe weather. When peak demand surges—most common during heat waves, such as the ones that struck the region in 2006 and 2011—the older, less efficient generating stations have a harder time keeping up, and brownouts or blackouts become more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superstorms can also disrupt Manhattan’s delivery infrastructure, despite the fact that it’s underground. In 2011, Hurricane Irene threatened to flood traffic and subway tunnels, also putting underground delivery at risk. The next year, Hurricane Sandy disrupted a third of the city’s electrical capacity. Flooding shut down five transmission substations. Other infrastructure was affected too, including natural gas and steam services (the latter provide heat and hot water, crucial during winter and for emergency facilities such as hospitals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandy inundated the subway tunnels, which rely on &lt;a href="https://www.6sqft.com/new-york-citys-subway-system-has-a-water-problem-a-13-million-gallon-one/"&gt;pumps&lt;/a&gt; to force out the water. Electrical failures can disrupt the cleanup process as much as flooding can. And once a subway station gets incapacitated, the impact cascades throughout the system. On Saturday night, when the Midtown blackout occurred, the MTA was forced to cut service on some lines affected by signal or station outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure, fire, and flood aren’t the only dangers that can befall transformer substations. Power infrastructure can be an appealing target for terrorism &lt;a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/12050/chapter/2"&gt;because&lt;/a&gt; the sites are poorly protected and the economic impact of a successful attack can be high—particularly in a city like New York. Cyberattacks are also possible. This March, a denial of service attack &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/ddos-attack-caused-interruptions-in-power-system-operations-doe.html"&gt;affected&lt;/a&gt; electrical systems in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, two major population centers. Intelligence suggests that the risk of similar foreign attacks is currently elevated. A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee discussed those risks &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/452901-congress-mobilizes-on-cyber-threats-to-electric-grid"&gt;in a hearing&lt;/a&gt; the day before the Midtown Manhattan blackout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to mitigate these dangers is to make utility infrastructure less susceptible to single points of failure. Underground distribution tends to make it easier to reach electrical customers via multiple paths. Regulatory agencies such as the New York State Reliability Council also &lt;a href="http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7B88B4CDB4-C09E-41B3-9EBD-896F2ECDD777%7D"&gt;impose requirements&lt;/a&gt; on utility service. Con Edison, which powers almost all of New York City, is expected to design its network to operate even if some of its components fail or are lost to disaster. But new risks associated with climate change, cyberwarfare, and other factors haven’t necessarily been accounted for in the design and operation of utility infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perils build on one another. Climate change amplifies the frequency of heat waves, which increases electrical load, which puts greater pressure on infrastructure. At the same time, it increases the likelihood of superstorms that can cause flooding, fire, and other disasters that might disrupt nodes in the network. When utility operators designed their equipment years or decades ago, they made assumptions about load, storm surge, and other factors. Those estimates might no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, planning and implementing updates to those systems is often stymied by paltry funding, strained political will, or other accidents. The utility industries are pushing for transformation, as it were, in infrastructure design, including efforts to make the “edges” of the grid &lt;a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/beyond-the-substation-how-5-proactive-states-are-transforming-the-grid-edg/369810/"&gt;more resilient and redundant&lt;/a&gt;. But those plans are similarly snared in the traps of outdated investment and regulation. Worse still, the same climatological, economic, and political instabilities that help increase the likelihood of electrical-grid collapse might also increase the risk of deliberate attacks to the grid, or reduce the agility of emergency response when accidents like this weekend’s Manhattan transformer fire occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these factors wafted up to street level Saturday night, as New Yorkers muddled through the inconvenience of a few hours without power. If anything, the scenes aboveground seemed inspiring, delightful even. Broadway-musical casts and Carnegie concert musicians &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briallenhopper/status/1150198299254767616"&gt;hosted impromptu sidewalk performances&lt;/a&gt; for disappointed theatergoers. Citizens took it upon themselves to &lt;a href="https://6abc.cm/2LQBSzx"&gt;direct traffic&lt;/a&gt; in chaotic intersections. As New Yorkers are wont to do, city dwellers celebrated these and similar acts as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Aisling_Tomei/status/1150215644270350336"&gt;telltale signs&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s vibrancy and resilience. When the power came back on, the horde of shadows &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DetJessRamirez/status/1150361350553657344"&gt;cheered in unison&lt;/a&gt; as electric lamps fueled by burning coal miles away restored them to the technicolor of modern, artificial light. No injuries were reported during the blackout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But such a generous response is only possible because power disruptions are still rare, especially absent the forewarning that accompanies a major hurricane or a serious thunderstorm. The chaos caused by similar, more frequent events would quickly snuff out the surprise and delight of unelectrified life. The theater performers would sneak home out the back, wondering whether the union would consider yet another disrupted performance complete. The citizen constables would spare their bodies, out of fear or boredom. The cheers would turn to groans, as the uncertainty and nuisance of the city’s physical caprices would wear thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worsening political and economic circumstances would only fuel this fire. The July 13, 1977, blackout came amid a widespread economic crisis, the Son of Sam serial killings, a heat wave, and other social stressors. The looting and vandalism that accompanied that blackout 42 years ago were surely underwritten by the increased crime of the age and the totality of the blackout, which wiped out power to the whole city for two days. But those and worse effects are still possible. If you didn’t notice, things aren’t so great in 2019, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blackout is a warning that infrastructure doesn’t only exist when it breaks. That’s true not just for New Yorkers, but for most of the U.S. population, which is scattered across regions with lower density, reduced wealth, and a more fickle public-service response. Whether it sleeps or not, a city is like an iceberg: You only see the smallest bit of it aboveground, but all of it is melting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/dvRbypqjRe0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ian Bogost</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_1155510873/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>David Dee Delgado / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Revenge of the Power Grid</title><published>2019-07-15T16:06:02-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-16T13:05:07-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Infrastructure doesn’t only exist when it fails.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/dvRbypqjRe0/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/manhattan-blackout-reveals-infrastructure-risk/594025/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593878</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="text-transform:uppercase;"&gt;Anaheim&lt;/span&gt;, Calif.—Last night, YouTube hosted its annual VidCon party, in one of the Anaheim Convention Center’s large halls, and YouTube executives, top influencers, and industry professionals mingled about the cavernous space, sipping beer and eating vegetable skewers and salad in cups as a DJ on a large circular platform in the center blasted pop hits. The party felt like a generic corporate-sponsored event. Probably because the real party was 1.9 miles down the road, at a private event hosted by TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Unlike YouTube’s event, TikTok’s party, at Bowlmor Lanes, was for creators only. Marketers and fans were not invited, but everyone still wanted in. Nearly an hour before the event was set to start, people began congregating outside. By 8:15 p.m., 15 minutes after the party had started, it was so packed that hundreds of TikTok creators were left standing outside. Sam Ko, who has more than 300,000 followers on the short-form video platform, initially lined up for the party at 7:45. By 10, she was still stuck waiting to enter. “I’m annoyed. We drove all the way here from Santa Monica,” she said. “I see other huge creators here, too, and they’re still waiting in line.” Micky Nolan, an 18-year-old with 220,000 followers on the app, says he couldn’t believe the mob scene. By 9:45, security guards were shouting at people to step back or they’d shut the whole party down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the mayhem, the event inside was worth the wait, according to attendees. Creators did backflips on the dance floor while the hip-hop singer Ty Dolla Sign performed live. Attendees noshed on finger food such as mozzarella sticks and mini burgers, then greasily attempted to win prizes at the free arcade. Groups crowded into an “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/lil-nas-xs-old-town-road-hits-no-1-country-or-not/586714/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Old Town Road&lt;/a&gt;”–themed photo area complete with cowboy hats and other props. Above them, giant screens displayed trending TikToks on loop. Between the bowling lanes, thousands of gummy bears had been erected in patterns, a reference to the &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/01/the-haribochallenge-mashes-up-adele-and-haribo-gold-bears.html"&gt;Haribo challenge&lt;/a&gt;, a meme that went viral on TikTok over the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;

You almost didn’t want to leave.” And when creators did exit, they were accosted by fans: Though the doors officially closed shortly after 10:15, crowds of fans hung around outside long afterward, hoping for a selfie with their favorite star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Every year, thousands of influencers, agents, managers, industry executives, and screaming teenage fans descend on the Anaheim Convention Center in search of the next big internet star. VidCon was founded 10 years ago by YouTubers to highlight the platform’s content &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/1857/11/how-creators-became-influencers/590725?utm_source=feed"&gt;creators&lt;/a&gt;, and over the past decade, many of them have seen their careers transformed by the event. It’s where brand deals are negotiated and crucial collaborations are planned. But this year, the platform everyone is talking about isn’t YouTube—it’s TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;TikTok, which boomed in China before entering the U.S. market in August, allows users to upload and edit 15-second videos, usually set to catchy music or voice-overs. The videos are fun and silly, and watching them feels like taking a break from the broader, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/twitter-keeps-rolling-out-features-but-not-the-ones-that-matter/569296/?utm_source=feed"&gt;toxic world of social media&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18064960786110474/"&gt;one video&lt;/a&gt;, a teen does a viral dance with traffic cones fitted to his legs. In another, a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18059392210048792/"&gt;stream of puppies tumble&lt;/a&gt; over one another to the beat of an EDM song. Less than a year after its U.S. launch, the platform is poised to dominate the American social-media landscape and upend the creator ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/05/how-creators-became-influencers/590725/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The real difference between creators and influencers&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Nowhere is that more apparent than at VidCon. Vanessa Pappas, the general manager for TikTok, spoke with industry executives at a fireside chat yesterday that was so popular, many people couldn’t get in; later, big TikTok stars held a meet and greet that was packed to capacity. Outside the primary entrance to the convention center, teenagers swarmed TikTok creators, shouting their names as they shot dance videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;None of this is by accident. All those mozzarella sticks and gummy bears didn’t come from nowhere: TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktoks-videos-are-goofy-its-strategy-to-dominate-social-media-is-serious-11561780861"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; spent nearly $1 billion on advertising alone last year, and has aggressively courted YouTube’s biggest creators. According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktoks-videos-are-goofy-its-strategy-to-dominate-social-media-is-serious-11561780861"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, TikTok paid one influencer $1 million for a single 15-second video. TikTok was the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktoks-videos-are-goofy-its-strategy-to-dominate-social-media-is-serious-11561780861"&gt;third-most-installed app worldwide in the first quarter of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, behind WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It boasts &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktoks-videos-are-goofy-its-strategy-to-dominate-social-media-is-serious-11561780861"&gt;1.2 billion monthly users&lt;/a&gt; globally, making it potentially bigger than Instagram, &lt;a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/"&gt;which reported 1 billion monthly users&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and a viable competitor to YouTube (&lt;a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/news/youtube-now-has-1-9-billion-monthly-active-users-180-million-hours-watched-on-tv-screens-every-day-1887916"&gt;1.9 billion monthly users&lt;/a&gt;) and Facebook (&lt;a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-stats-for-marketers/"&gt;more than 2 billion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="504" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Image_from_iOS_3/6a99dd7eb.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;The TikTok stars Kevin Perry and Caroline Erickstad pose at VidCon 2019. (Taylor Lorenz)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But VidCon is the first time TikTok has asserted its dominance in the wider creator culture. It is also the first time top U.S. influencers on the platform have all come together in one space. Many TikTokers arrived at VidCon bent on seizing this moment: They preplanned collaborations via group chat before arriving, and on Wednesday afternoon, before the conference even officially started, some of the platform’s stars stood outside the convention center making videos together and giving one another shout-outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wherever TikTok stars go, they are surrounded by fans. Yesterday evening, an ever-replenishing stream of teenage girls inundated Joe Waud, a 16-year-old with 1.1 million followers on the platform, and Payton Moormeier (15; 3.3 million followers) with requests, and Waud and Moormeier happily obliged. They talked to fans’ mothers, took selfies, signed notebooks, posed for videos, and recorded skits for fans’ personal Instagram and Snapchat accounts. At one point, Waud crouched down on the ground and tied a girl’s shoe as she gleefully recorded it on Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="896" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Image_from_iOS_5/be95e1756.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;The TikTok star @kevboyperry poses with a fan. (Taylor Lorenz)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Several teenagers said they came to VidCon specifically to see big TikTokers. The 14-year-old Grace Weikel traveled all the way from St. Louis to meet her favorites. “I think more people came here for TikTok people than YouTube people,” says Kate Thomas, a 13-year-old from Laguna Beach, California. Her friend Gigi Trimarche, also 13, agrees. “Big YouTubers get ahead of themselves,” she says. “They have too much confidence to the point where they think they’re too good to be around their lower fans.” She says she was hardly able to see YouTubers aside from onstage, but had numerous interactions with her favorite TikTokers. “I got on a couple of their backs,” she says. “I ran and jumped into Payton’s arms … We took TikToks with some big people, like &lt;a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/mychaelade.html"&gt;Mychaelade&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the separation between fans and YouTube’s biggest stars is by design. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17500590/tanacon-disaster-fyre-fest-tana-mongeau-youtuber"&gt;disorganization in past years&lt;/a&gt;, VidCon has become a well-oiled machine. Security is tight, and featured creators are prevented from going out and greeting the public, lest they cause a scene. Top influencers are instead shuttled between events in black SUVs. Fans can’t even approach them during dedicated Q&amp;amp;A sessions. Instead, members of the audience are asked to submit questions via Twitter. But because TikTok stars are so new, they don’t have as many restrictions. They’re able to leverage VidCon as a massive meet and greet, the way many YouTubers did before they got too famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/emma-chamberlain-and-rise-relatable-influencer/593230/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Emma Chamberlain is the most important YouTuber today&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The older generation doesn’t realize how important TikTok is yet,” says B. Dave, a 21-year-old who has 40,000 followers on TikTok. “But the younger kids are all on it; they’re looking for people to follow.” Lee McCall, who has 2.2 million followers, agrees. “There’s so much hype. It’s so different than any other app right now,” she says. While YouTube and Instagram are heavily saturated with influencers, TikTok is fertile ground for would-be social-media stars looking to build an audience. “The David Dobriks out there are untouchable,” says Piff Peterson (1.5 million followers), referring to a popular YouTuber. TikTok stars “are still on the come-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One segment of the adult population that does seem to realize the importance of TikTok is brand marketers. At an industry event on Wednesday night, a group of advertisers discussed the ways brands are using the app with enthusiasm, touting the connections they had made within the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="575" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Image_from_iOS/afe6a486e.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;TikTok stars who never got into the afterparty pose outside the event. (Taylor Lorenz)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“TikTok is certainly the most buzz-worthy platform out there,” Tressie Lieberman, the vice president of digital marketing for Chipotle, told me yesterday. “I think they’re hitting culture at the right moment.” Chipotle recently launched a sponsored “challenge” encouraging users to flip the lid of their burrito bowl. For it, the brand partnered with 15 TikTok creators in addition to Dobrik, who used the campaign to launch his own TikTok account; the challenge generated 200 million total views. Lieberman said that TikTok provides a fresh place for brands to be experimental and make an impact, unlike other social networks that are already saturated with ads. “The fact that every single person who opened TikTok saw David Dobrik flipping a Chipotle lid—you can’t do that on any other platform,” Lieberman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Of course, many other social apps have launched to great fanfare, only to fade out in a year or two. To remain successful, TikTok will also have to provide scalable ways for influencers to make money on the platform. That could mean &lt;a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/157977/inside-the-secret-meeting-that-changed-the-fate-of-vine-forever"&gt;paying creators directly for content&lt;/a&gt;, helping them negotiate brand deals (such as the Chipotle integration), or adding e-commerce capabilities, as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/youre-about-spend-so-much-money-instagram/588373/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Instagram recently did&lt;/a&gt;. And while teenagers can help solidify a platform’s space in the culture, young people are notoriously fickle and quick to abandon apps when a new platform comes along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/influencers-are-abandoning-instagram-look/587803/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The Instagram aesthetic is over&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;TikTok is also not the only Chinese company interested in entering the Western market. On Wednesday, the Qingteng Club, a group affiliated with the social-media and gaming company Tencent, hosted the East-West Forum. The private event, which was not part of VidCon, was targeted toward Chinese tech execs looking to enter the American market. The agenda for the event, obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, featured talks with titles such as “What Can U.S. and China’s Digital Industry Learn From Each Other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was mostly people from Chinese companies trying to learn from Americans; they wanted to know what problems we could have here so they could take those learnings back to China,” said one attendee, who asked to remain anonymous because the event was off the record. “Chinese execs were basically like, &lt;em&gt;Tell us everything wrong with your platforms&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The fame TikTok has generated for its top stars has already begun to impact the creator landscape in America. Joy Jefferson, a TikTok star with 340,000 followers, posted to YouTube for two years but struggled to gain an audience of more than 1,000 followers. Frustrated, he quit posting to YouTube and decided to just use TikTok. Now he’s part of what he calls the “new wave” of influencers. “TikTok has made me more willing to pursue the career of being a social influencer,” he says. “The fact that everything happened the way it did on TikTok has opened my eyes to what I can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/uXPnzAibnrI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Taylor Lorenz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/taylor-lorenz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/IMG_4676_3/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Taylor Lorenz</media:credit><media:description>The TikTok stars Joe Waud and Payton Moormeier pose with fans at VidCon 2019.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">TikTok Stars Are Preparing to Take Over the Internet</title><published>2019-07-12T14:32:23-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-12T18:40:47-04:00</updated><summary type="html">A new wave of online creators is here.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/uXPnzAibnrI/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/tiktok-stars-are-preparing-take-over-internet/593878/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593821</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In suicide-prevention literature, “gatekeepers” are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28083369"&gt;community members&lt;/a&gt; who may be able to offer help when someone expresses suicidal thoughts. It’s a loose designation, but it generally includes teachers, parents, coaches, and older co-workers—people with some form of authority and ability to intervene when they see anything troubling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Could it also include Google? When users search certain key phrases related to suicide methods, Google’s results prominently feature the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. But the system isn’t foolproof. Google can’t edit webpages, just search results, meaning internet users looking for information about how to kill themselves could easily find it through linked pages or on forums, never having used a search engine at all. At the same time, on the 2019 internet, “run me over” is more likely to be a &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/love-death-and-begging-for-celebrities-to-kill-you"&gt;macabre expression of fandom&lt;/a&gt; than a sincere cry for help—a nuance a machine might not understand. Google’s artificial intelligence is also &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/lm-efs101018.php"&gt;much less effective&lt;/a&gt; at detecting suicidal ideation when people search in languages other than English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ultimately, search results are a useful, but very broad, area in which to apply prevention strategies. After all, anyone could be looking for anything for any reason. Google’s latest foray into algorithmic suicide prevention is more targeted, for people who are already asking for help. In May, the tech giant &lt;a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/trvr_press/the-trevor-project-is-a-google-ai-impact-grantee/#sm.00001fngh0sfuqd1cxw0pin80t8a2"&gt;granted $1.5 million&lt;/a&gt; to the Trevor Project, a California-based nonprofit that offers crisis counseling to LGBTQ teenagers via a phone line (TrevorLifeline), a texting service (TrevorText), and an instant-messaging platform (TrevorChat). The project’s leaders want to improve TrevorText and TrevorChat by using machine learning to automatically assess suicide risk. It’s all centered on the initial question that begins every session with a Trevor counselor: “What’s going on?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We want to make sure that, in a nonjudgmental way, we’ll talk suicide with them if it’s something that’s on their mind,” says Sam Dorison, the Trevor Project’s chief of staff. “And really let them guide the conversation. Do [they] want to talk about coming out [or] resources by LGBT communities within their community? We really let them guide the conversation through what would be most helpful to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Currently, those who reach out enter a first-come, first-served queue.Trevor’s average wait time is less than five minutes, but in some cases, every second counts. Trevor’s leadership hopes that eventually, the AI will be able to identify high-risk callers via their response to that first question, and connect them with human counselors immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Google’s AI will be trained using two data points: the very beginning of youths’ conversations with counselors, and the risk assessment counselors complete after they’ve spoken with them. The idea is that by looking at how initial responses compare with ultimate risk, the AI can be trained to predict suicide risk based on the earliest response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We think that if we’re able to train the model based on those first few messages and the risk assessment, that there’s a lot more things that you don’t see that a machine could pick up on and can potentially help us learn more about,” says John Callery, the director of technology for the Trevor Project. Counselors will continue to make their own assessments, Callery added, noting that Trevor’s deescalation rate is 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Algorithms have incredible potential to recognize unseen patterns, but what’s essential to being a good gatekeeper is agency—stepping forward and intervening if something’s wrong. That may or may not be a thing we want to imbue technology with, though in some ways we already have. Public-health &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/02/canada-track-suicide-risk-social-media-ai/"&gt;initiatives in Canada &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/06/uk-northumbria-university-social-media-data-suicide-warning-signs/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFR_4GSbk54xqqmydZwttZOaRYPO3DW6koq7bGqXZhT1pq14bYzLzMdiOYMEjSN61D4JaAQEaRoe3tVhb3rv3oGdueNGR_hJjfIaGko74QcthXoLr5CsmTgipPlb3be2cPk3vPXq6Xl5yHS-W1n9TGsXPERd7OG74AhWWZSj5FBd"&gt;the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; mine social-media data to predict suicide risk. Facebook &lt;a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/09/inside-feed-suicide-prevention-and-ai/"&gt;uses AI to quickly&lt;/a&gt; flag live videos to police if algorithms detect self-harm or violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We query Google on everything from hangover cures to medical advice to how to get over a breakup. The results can be mixed, or even misleading, but the search bar doesn’t pass judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“[Students] go home, they get online, and they can disclose any of this stuff to anybody in the whole world,” says Stephen Russell, the chair of human development and family science at the University of Texas at Austin. Russell has been conducting &lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2018/03/30/name-use-matters-for-transgender-youths-mental-health/"&gt;pioneering research&lt;/a&gt; on LGBTQ youth for decades and says that while troubled students “shouldn’t have to go to Google” to address these problems, training real-life gatekeepers to be open and engaged allies doesn’t always work, because of decades of stigma and bias against the queer community. “Even today I hear [administrators] say, ‘Well, we don’t have kids like that here.’ That’s been an ongoing dilemma,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Which is where the Trevor Project comes in. Eventually, the nonprofit’s leaders want an AI system that will predict what resources youths will need—housing, coming-out help, therapy—all by scanning the first few messages in a chat. Long term, they hope to evolve the AI so it can recognize patterns in metadata beyond just scanning initial messages. For example, if the AI could determine reading or education level from the messages, could it make inferences about how structural factors affect suicide risk? It seems impossible that following a tangled field of “if, then” statements could save someone’s life, but soon enough, it could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/VButt5Q1Ocw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Sidney Fussell</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sidney-fussell/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/AP_19115743143426/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Alastair Grant / AP Photo</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The AI That Could Help Curb Youth Suicide</title><published>2019-07-12T12:47:51-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-12T16:20:19-04:00</updated><summary type="html">For many reasons, parents and teachers may fail to intervene when they spot LGBTQ teens in trouble.

It has the potential to be one of the most significant and far-reaching revolutions in history, yet it has developed out of disparate efforts to solve specific practical problems rather than a comprehensive plan. Ironically, the ultimate effect of this case-by-case problem solving may be the transformation of human reasoning and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revolution is unstoppable. Attempts to halt it would cede the future to that element of humanity more courageous in facing the implications of its own inventiveness. Instead, we should accept that AI is bound to become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous, and ask ourselves: How will its evolution affect human perception, cognition, and interaction? What will be its impact on our culture and, in the end, our history?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such questions brought together the three authors of this article: a historian and sometime policy maker; a former chief executive of a major technology company; and the dean of a principal technology-oriented academic institution. We have been meeting for three years to try to understand these issues and their associated riddles. Each of us is convinced of our inability, within the confines of our respective fields of expertise, to fully analyze a future in which machines help guide their own evolution, improving themselves to better solve the problems for which they were designed. So as a starting point—and, we hope, a springboard for wider discussion—we are engaged in framing a more detailed set of questions about the significance of AI’s development for human civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The AlphaZero Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last December, the developers of AlphaZero published their explanation of the process by which the program mastered chess—a process, it turns out, that ignored human chess strategies developed over centuries and classic games from the past. Having been taught the rules of the game, AlphaZero trained itself entirely by self-play and, in less than 24 hours, became the best chess player in the world—better than grand masters and, until then, the most sophisticated chess-playing computer program in the world. It did so by playing like neither a grand master nor a preexisting program. It conceived and executed moves that both humans and human-trained machines found counterintuitive, if not simply wrong. The founder of the company that created AlphaZero called its performance “chess from another dimension” and proof that sophisticated AI “is no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now established chess experts are studying AlphaZero’s moves, hoping to incorporate its knowledge into their own play. These studies are practical, but larger philosophical questions also emerge. Among those that are currently unanswerable: How can we explain AlphaZero’s capacity to invent a new approach to chess on the basis of a very brief learning period? What was the reality it explored? Will AI lead to an as-yet-unimaginable expansion of familiar reality?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can expect comparable discoveries by AI in other fields. Some will upend conventional wisdom and standard practices; others will merely tweak them. Nearly all will leave us struggling to understand. Consider the conduct of driverless cars stopped at a traffic light. When cars driven by people inch forward to try to beat the traffic, some driverless cars occasionally join them, though nothing in the rules of driving given to them suggests that they should do so. If this inching-forward has been learned, how and for what purpose? How is it different from what people are taught and learn about waiting at traffic lights? What else might AI learn that it is not “telling” us (because AI does not or cannot explain)? By enabling a process of self-learning for inanimate objects, we do not yet know what we are starting, but we need to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Nature of the Revolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heretofore, digital evolution has relied on human beings to create the software and analyze the data that are so profoundly affecting our lives. Recent advances have recast this process. AI has made it possible to automate an extraordinary range of tasks, and has done so by enabling machines to play a role—an increasingly decisive role—in drawing conclusions from data and then taking action. AI draws lessons from its own experience, unlike traditional software, which can only support human reasoning. The growing transfer of judgment from human beings to machines denotes the revolutionary aspect of AI, as described last year in these pages (“&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-mean-the-end-of-human-history/559124/?utm_source=feed"&gt;How the Enlightenment Ends&lt;/a&gt;,” June 2018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the word &lt;i&gt;intelligence&lt;/i&gt; does not adequately explain what is occurring, and ascribing anthropomorphic qualities to AI is out of order. AI is neither malicious nor kind; it does not have independently developed intent or goals; it does not engage in self-reflection. What AI can do is to perform well-specified tasks to help discover associations between data and actions, providing solutions for quandaries people find difficult and perhaps impossible. This process creates new forms of automation and in time might yield entirely new ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet AI systems today, and perhaps inherently, struggle to teach or to explain how they arrive at their solutions or why those solutions are superior. It is up to human beings to decipher the significance of what AI systems are doing and to develop interpretations. In some ways, AI is comparable to the classical oracle of Delphi, which left to human beings the interpretation of its cryptic messages about human destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If AI improves constantly—and there is no reason to think it will not—the changes it will impose on human life will be transformative. Here are but two illustrations: a macro-example from the field of global and national security, and a micro-example dealing with the potential role of AI in human relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI, Grand Strategy, and Security&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the nuclear age, strategy evolved around the concept of deterrence. Deterrence is predicated on the rationality of parties, and the premise that stability can be ensured by nuclear and other military deployments that can be neutralized only by deliberate acts leading to self-destruction; the likelihood of retaliation deters attack. Arms-control agreements with monitoring systems were developed in large part to avoid challenges from rogue states or false signals that might trigger a catastrophic response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardly any of these strategic verities can be applied to a world in which AI plays a significant role in national security. If AI develops new weapons, strategies, and tactics by simulation and other clandestine methods, control becomes elusive, if not impossible. The premises of arms control based on disclosure will alter: Adversaries’ ignorance of AI-developed configurations will become a strategic advantage—an advantage that would be sacrificed at a negotiating table where transparency as to capabilities is a prerequisite. The opacity (and also the speed) of the cyberworld may overwhelm current planning models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the arms-control regime taught us that grand strategy requires an understanding of the capabilities and military deployments of potential adversaries. But if more and more intelligence becomes opaque, how will policy makers understand the views and abilities of their adversaries and perhaps even allies? Will many different internets emerge or, in the end, only one? What will be the implications for cooperation? For confrontation? As AI becomes ubiquitous, new concepts for its security need to emerge. One of them is the capability to disconnect from the network on which it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More pointed—and potentially more worrisome—issues loom. Does the existence of weapons of unknowable potency increase or decrease the likelihood of future conflict? In the face of the unknown, will fear increase the tendency to preempt? The incentives will be for opacity, which could mean absolute insecurity. In these circumstances, how will norms and rules for guiding and restraining strategy be established? The need to develop strategic concepts relevant to this new and inevitable technology has become overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Human Contact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa are digital assistants already installed in millions of homes and designed for daily conversation: They answer queries and offer advice that, especially to children, may seem intelligent, even wise. And they can become a solution to the abiding loneliness of the elderly, many of whom interact with these devices as friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more data AI gathers and analyzes, the more precise it becomes, so devices such as these will learn their owners’ preferences and take them into account in shaping their answers. And as they get “smarter,” they will become more intimate companions. As a result, AI could induce humans to feel toward it emotions it is incapable of reciprocating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, people rank their smartphones as their most important possession. They name their Roombas, and attribute intent to them where none exists. What happens when these devices become even more sophisticated? Will people become as attached to their digital pets as to their dogs—or perhaps even more so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Societies will adopt these devices in ways most compatible with their cultures, in some cases accentuating cultural differences. In Japan, for example, as a result of both an aging population and Shintoism (which considers inanimate objects to have spirits not unlike humans’), AI companions may become even more widespread than in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these developments, it is possible that in many parts of the world, from early childhood onward the primary sources of interaction and knowledge will be not parents, family members, friends, or teachers, but rather digital companions, whose constantly available interaction will yield both a learning bonanza and a privacy challenge. AI algorithms will help open new frontiers of knowledge, while at the same time narrowing information choices and enhancing the capacity to suppress new or challenging ideas. AI is able to remove obstacles of language and many inhibitions of culture. But the same technology also creates an unprecedented ability to constrain or shape the diffusion of information. The technological capacity of governments to monitor the behavior and movements of tens or hundreds of millions is likewise unprecedented. Even in the West, this quest can, in the name of harmony, become a slippery slope. Balancing the risks of aberrant behavior against limits on personal freedom—or even defining &lt;i&gt;aberrant&lt;/i&gt;—will be a crucial challenge of the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many public projections of AI have the attributes of science fiction. But in the real world, there are many hopeful trends. AI will make fundamental positive contributions in vital areas such as health, safety, and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there remain areas of worrisome impact: in diminished inquisitiveness as humans entrust AI with an increasing share of the quest for knowledge; in diminished trust via inauthentic news and videos; in the new possibilities it opens for terrorism; in weakened democratic systems due to AI manipulation; and perhaps in a reduction of opportunities for human work due to automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes ubiquitous, how will it be regulated? Monitored? As we enter a world where people are taught by AI, will there be the AI equivalent of “approved” school textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge of absorbing this new technology into the values and practices of the existing culture has no precedent. The most comparable event was the transition from the medieval to the modern period. In the medieval period, people interpreted the universe as a creation of the divine and all its manifestations as emanations of divine will. When the unity of the Christian Church was broken, the question of what unifying concept could replace it arose. The answer finally emerged in what we now call the Age of Enlightenment; great philosophers replaced divine inspiration with reason, experimentation, and a pragmatic approach. Other interpretations followed: philosophy of history; sociological interpretations of reality. But the phenomenon of a machine that assists—or possibly surpasses—humans in mental labor and helps to both predict and shape outcomes is unique in human history. The Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant ascribed truth to the impact of the structure of the human mind on observed reality. AI’s truth is more contingent and ambiguous; it modifies itself as it acquires and analyzes data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="curated"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;How should we respond to the inevitable evolution it will impose on our understanding of truth and reality? The three of us have discussed many ideas: programming digital assistants to refuse to answer philosophical questions, especially about the bounds of reality; requiring human involvement in high-stakes pattern recognition, such as the reading of X-rays; developing simulations in which AI can practice defining for itself ambiguous human values—&lt;i&gt;what is ethical? reasonable? does no harm?&lt;/i&gt;—in various situations; “auditing” AI and correcting it when it inaccurately emulates our values; establishing a new field, an “AI ethics,” to facilitate thinking about the responsible administration of AI, the way bioethics has facilitated thinking about the responsible administration of biology and medicine. Importantly, all such efforts must be undertaken according to three time horizons: what we already know, what we are sure to discover in the near future, and what we are likely to discover when AI becomes widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three of us differ in the extent to which we are optimists about AI. But we agree that it is changing human knowledge, perception, and reality—and, in so doing, changing the course of human history. We seek to understand it and its consequences, and encourage others across disciplines to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/3fCCB0i9_y0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Henry A.

Parker’s four children, ages 9 to 18, now use Trello, which is more typically used at work, to keep up with chores, to-do lists, shopping, and homework. “I use it every day to keep track of what schoolwork I need to do, or places I need to be, things to buy,” Hannah, her 15-year-old daughter, says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“College was my first experience of having to keep track of my own stuff,” Tonya said. “I wanted [my kids] to have that sooner.” Incorporating Trello, along with Gmail, into the Parker family’s life has been a godsend, in Tonya’s view. It streamlined family communication, helped keep everyone organized, and added a layer of accountability to tasks. Now, instead of wondering if her children forgot to do something, Parker says she can ask, “How are you doing on your checklist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s free-play time has &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/all-work-and-no-play-why-your-kids-are-more-anxious-depressed/246422/?utm_source=feed"&gt;been on the decline&lt;/a&gt; for more than 50 years, and their participation in extracurricular activities has led to more schedule-juggling for parents. Parents are busier too, especially those whose jobs demand ever more attention after hours: &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/upshot/stressed-tired-rushed-a-portrait-of-the-modern-family.html"&gt;65 percent&lt;/a&gt; of parents with a college degree have trouble balancing work and family, a &lt;a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/11/04/raising-kids-and-running-a-household-how-working-parents-share-the-load/"&gt;2015 Pew Research Center report&lt;/a&gt; found, compared with about half of those without a college degree. In an effort to cope, some families are turning to software designed for offices. Parents are finding project-management platforms such as Trello, Asana, and Jira, in addition to Slack, a workplace communication tool (its slogan is “Where work happens”), particularly useful in their personal lives. In other words, confronted with relentless busyness, some modern households are starting to run more like offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/04/oster-cribsheet-parenting-guide/587734/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Parenting like an economist is a lot less stressful&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Berkun Fajgenbaum, a mom of three children ages 8 to 12, uses Google Calendar to manage her children’s time and Jira to keep track of home projects. Ryan Florence, a dad in Seattle, set up a family Slack account for his immediate and extended family to communicate more easily. And Melanie Platte, a mom in Utah, says Trello has transformed her family life. After using it at work, she implemented it at home in 2016. “We do family meetings every Sunday where we review goals for the week, our to-do list, and activities coming up,” she says. “I track notes for the meeting [in Trello]. I have different sections, goals for the week, a to-do list.” Her oldest son started high school last year, and Platte says that without productivity and task-management software, she doesn’t know how he could manage it all. Trello allows her son to track responsibilities and deadlines, and set incremental goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525559252"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, From Birth to Preschool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and her husband started using Asana at home nearly a decade ago, when they bought a house and were expecting a baby. “We all of a sudden had a bunch of stuff to deal with,” she says, explaining how Asana made the jump from software her husband used for work to software they used as a couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hectic days of new parenthood, the platform provided a way of managing all the sleep training and child-care-coordinating Oster and her husband were doing. The to-do lists these days are a bit thinner—her two kids are no longer toddlers—but the couple’s Asana use surges during big projects, like a home renovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oster, who is a contributing writer at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, says she takes a “business-y approach” to other aspects of home life as well. After she and her husband arrive at a decision as parents, it’s not uncommon for one of them to send an email recap, something along the lines of “As per our earlier conversation, we have decided that the children will be enrolled in tennis camp over the summer. Please let me know if you want to follow up on this.” She acknowledges that such a note is “more like an email I think most people send at their jobs,” but says it helps minimize miscommunication and confusion about the many things she and her husband are juggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asana said it doesn’t collect data on the various “personal-use cases” its software is put toward. But Joshua Zerkel, the company’s head of global community, says that in talking with people about how they use the product, he hears many say it comes in handy for nonbusiness purposes, such as planning a wedding or a move. When asked how Asana might be designed differently if it were intended for personal use, he said, “I don’t know that that much would actually change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of Trello as a tool you can use across work and life,” says Stella Garber, the company’s head of marketing. “The example we had on our homepage for a long time was a kitchen remodel. On our mobile app the example was a Hawaiian vacation. We know humans have a lot of things they need organized, not just what they have at work." (Slack declined to share any information about how people use its software, and Atlassian, which owns Jira, did not respond to a similar request.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these tools’ utility in home life, it’s work where most people first become comfortable with them. “The membrane that divides work and family life is more porous than it’s ever been before,” says Bruce Feiler, a dad and the author of &lt;a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780061778735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secrets of Happy Families&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “So it makes total sense that these systems built for team building, problem solving, productivity, and communication that were invented in the workplace are migrating to the family space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Mazmanian, an informatics professor at UC Irvine, agrees. “The way that we imagine knowledge work and more and more kinds of work is really about coordination and collaboration across distance, across people’s different time commitments, managing attention, figuring out who’s going to do what when,” she says. “And that style of work … It’s very similar to family life, if you think about it.” Perhaps one’s children and direct reports are not so different after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazmanian says that these programs might be of particular value to households with two working parents, an arrangement that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/upshot/stressed-tired-rushed-a-portrait-of-the-modern-family.html"&gt;more children grow up with now, compared with a few decades ago&lt;/a&gt;. Without one adult in charge of the professional domain and one in charge of the domestic domain, there’s more coordination of who’s in charge of what—which is something productivity tools can assist with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wonders whether a program like Asana might help even out the imbalances in household duties that often arise between partners—especially men and women—by making them more visible. “It tends to be that couples divide this work up in ways that aren’t exactly equitable, and that one person takes on more of that truly invisible work … Something like this might actually be a way for that person to say, ‘Look what I’m doing’ [to their] family [or] partner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the desire to streamline home life is also a product of how much employers ask of today’s knowledge workers. “I see the use of business software within households as an effort to cope with feeling too stretched at work,” says Erin Kelly, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management and a co-author of the forthcoming book &lt;em&gt;Overload: How Good Jobs Went Bad and What We Can Do About It&lt;/em&gt;. She says that the “escalating demands” of many white-collar jobs leave workers (parents or not) increasingly frazzled and worn out—so the same tools that systematize their workdays might appeal as a way to cut down on the time they spend organizing life at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strategy doesn’t always play out smoothly, though. For Peder Fjällström, using Slack at home was mainly a fun experiment. A former app designer who lives in Stockholm and is starting a kombucha brand, Fjällström, initially was excited about using the software at home a couple of years after adopting it at work: He custom-built little tools within the program that would let members of his family add an item to the grocery list when something was running low, report “bugs” in the house (like a broken appliance), and determine the kids’ current location (pulled from the Find My iPhone app). On occasion, Slack was also a way for Fjällström and his wife to summon their two kids at dinnertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Slack experiment lasted only three or four months—the kids soon gravitated toward apps that were “more fun.” After some reflection, Fjällström has concluded that using Slack with his family made home life feel more like work. “It helped at that point in time because it felt like life was a bit messy … but life is supposed to be a little bit messy.” There are things, he recognizes, that productivity software doesn’t optimize for, such as carving out quality family time and allowing children to “feel all the emotions.” “That’s what we’re aiming for at the moment,” he said, “not structure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/hrmKTMtuoKQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Taylor Lorenz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/taylor-lorenz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><author><name>Joe Pinsker</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/joe-pinsker/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_1075384836/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Sol de Zuasnabar Brebbia / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Slackification of the American Home</title><published>2019-07-11T07:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-22T11:21:52-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Stretched for time, some households are starting to operate more like businesses.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/hrmKTMtuoKQ/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/families-slack-asana/593584/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:39-592762</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;A&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;s a shooter &lt;/span&gt;in Christchurch, New Zealand, set about massacring dozens of worshippers at two mosques on March 15, his body cam beamed live footage to social media. Soon after, Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, learned that it was being uploaded to the platform. The company put thousands of human beings and a pile of algorithms to work finding and removing the snuff footage. It was already too late. As &lt;i&gt;The Economist &lt;/i&gt;recounted not long ago, “Before she went to bed at 1am Ms Wojcicki was still able to find the video.” And no wonder: It was being uploaded as often as once every second, a dispersal “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/facebook-and-youtube-defend-response-to-christchurch-videos"&gt;unprecedented both in scale and speed&lt;/a&gt;,” as a YouTube spokesperson told &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;. Facebook, also scrambling, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/facebook-youtube-new-zealand-tragedy-video/585418/?utm_source=feed"&gt;removed the video from users’ pages 1.5 million times&lt;/a&gt; in the first 24 hours after the shooting. Yet nearly two months later, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/tech/new-zealand-video-instagram-facebook/index.html"&gt;CNN reported still finding it on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long before the attack, Justin Kosslyn, who was then an executive at Jigsaw, a technology incubator created by Google, had published an article on Vice.com called “&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3k9q33/the-internet-needs-more-friction"&gt;The Internet Needs More Friction&lt;/a&gt;.” The internet, he argued, was built for instantaneous communication, but the absence of even brief delays in transmission had proved a boon to disinformation, malware, phishing, and other security threats. “It’s time to bring friction back,” he wrote. “Friction buys time, and time reduces systemic risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosslyn was onto something—something whose implications extend well beyond the threats he discussed. Despite the Christchurch video, YouTube (&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/05/04/the-tricky-task-of-policing-youtube"&gt;reports &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is not about to rethink the premise that “people around the world should have the right to upload and view content instantly.” But YouTube &lt;i&gt;should &lt;/i&gt;rethink that premise, and so should the rest of us. Instanticity, if you will, is turning out to be a bug of online life and internet architecture, not a feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, through the internet’s first and second generations, people naturally assumed that faster must be better; slowness was a vestige of a bygone age, a technological hurdle to be overcome. What they missed is that human institutions and intermediaries often impose slowness on purpose. Slowness is a social technology in its own right, one that protects humans from themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, old-media publications such as &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;. The digital operations of all three are speedy. But almost nothing goes online without first being vetted by at least one pair of editorial eyeballs. That costs money and slows down the content flow, of course, and for a time, many old-media types wondered whether our cumbersome, expensive bureaucracies were on their way to being obsolete. After all, social media promised to unleash millions of on-scene, real-time reporters, while allowing readers to curate their own news feeds and allowing experts to weigh in without being filtered by journalists. Who needed professional editors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But old media’s premises turned out to be anything but obsolete. As a group, consumers are terrible editors. Many are poorly informed, inaccurate, biased, manipulable, sloppy, impulsive, or self-serving. And even though some are not, the bad can quickly drive away the good. I am not suggesting that social media should be edited in the style of a newspaper circa 1983. Even if old-style editing of, say, Facebook’s more than 1 billion daily posts were feasible, it would not be desirable; that degree of friction would defeat social media’s self-expressive purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the lessons of old media remain relevant. Social-media companies do, after all, practice a certain kind of editing. They have rules that promote some types of content and prohibit other types, and they maintain systems to delete or demote violations. Facebook deploys both artificial intelligence and thousands of human beings to identify and remove 18 types of content, such as material that glorifies violence or celebrates suffering. So editing is happening. It’s just happening after publication, instead of before, partly because instanticity allows no time for prior vetting—even by the user herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/old-media-values-in-new-media-venues/280367/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Old-media values in new-media venues&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a simple change. A user creates a post or video on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or wherever. She presses the button to post it. And then … she &lt;i&gt;waits&lt;/i&gt;. Only after an interval does her post go live. The interval might be 10 minutes, or it might be an hour, or it might be user-selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that interval, something might happen. The user might receive a warning that a factual claim in her post had been disputed by leading fact-checkers. Facebook already provides such warnings, offering fact-checkers’ appraisals and asking users whether they wish to proceed anyway. Or, if she chose, her post might be routed to a handful of trusted friends, who might advise her that she was about to tweet herself out of a job. Or, toward the end of the interval, she might be required to view a screen displaying her post and asking, “Are you sure you’re ready to share this with the world? Remember, it will be out there forever.” Meanwhile, algorithms and humans could ensure that she isn’t posting a snuff video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is not the particulars. There is no single right way to introduce slowth. The point, rather, is this: Strategically introduced friction gives platforms and users time to vet content in whatever way they deem appropriate. It might reduce the velocity of something like the Christchurch video enough to give platforms’ monitors a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if nothing at all—no checking or vetting or reviewing—were done in the interval before a post or video went live, the waiting period itself would offer an important advantage. It would allow thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;H&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;umans have not one&lt;/span&gt; but two cognitive systems. In his book &lt;i&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt;, the Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls them System 1 and System 2. System 1 is intuitive, automatic, and impulsive. It makes snap judgments about dangers such as predators or opportunities such as food, and it delivers them to our awareness without conscious thought. It is also often wrong. It is biased and emotional. It overreacts and underreacts. System 2, by contrast, is slower and involves wearying cognitive labor. It gathers facts, consults evidence, weighs arguments, and makes reasoned judgments. It protects us from the errors and impulsivity of System 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/cognitive-bias/565775/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The cognitive biases tricking your brain&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need both systems, especially if we care about anger management. Arthur C. Brooks, a social scientist and the author of the recent book &lt;i&gt;Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt&lt;/i&gt;, told me in an email that one of the most effective ways to tone down social hostility is to “put some cognitive space between stimulus and response when you are in a hot hedonic state—or, as everyone’s mom used to put it, ‘When you’re mad, count to ten before you answer.’ ” Slowing ourselves down gives time for System 2 to kick in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offline, our lives are hemmed in by institutions that force us to engage System 2, even when we are disinclined to. Children are taught to wait their turn before talking; grown-ups are frequently required to wait before marrying, divorcing, buying a gun. No matter how sure they may feel, scientists face peer review, lawyers face adversarial proceedings, and so forth. Also, back in the day, before instanticity, technology itself slowed us down. Printing and distributing words required several distinct stages and often multiple people; even a trip to the mailbox or a wait for the mail carrier afforded time for second thoughts. Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman, and Winston Churchill were among the many public figures who wrote what Lincoln called “hot letters,” splenetic missives that vented anger but were never mailed. (Usually. One of Truman’s rants escaped and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/remembering-the-time-a-president-threatened-to-punch-a-washington-post-critic/2017/02/25/d2053ffc-f9e6-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html"&gt;threatened a &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; writer with a black eye&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="curated"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;On social media, no publisher or postal worker forces a pause. In 2013, a public-relations executive posted a tasteless and apparently racist joke on Twitter, intending (she later said) to satirize bigotry, not endorse it. Then she boarded an 11-hour flight. By the time she disembarked, she was world-famous, and not in a good way. She lost her job and became a pariah. What if Twitter had required her to pause for a while, and then asked her whether she was sure about her tweet? We’ll never know, but time to reflect might very well have improved her judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an acquaintance of mine found himself compelled to apologize for tweeting profanely. I asked him: Would a cooling-off period have made a difference? He replied that he would still have shared his thoughts, but more temperately. And, he added, if Twitter offered a setting requiring users to take 10 before tweeting, he would turn it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instanticity is hard to walk away from. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Social-media companies are addicted to addictiveness&lt;/a&gt;, and some might resist any curtailment of profitable impulsivity. Some users might also reject a cooling-off interval, or abandon a platform that imposed one. Yet many other people are already trying to count to 10 before they tweet, and would welcome help. And many tech-industry leaders are looking for ways to dial back internet-enabled pathologies. Rethinking instanticity would help us put our better selves forward, perhaps often enough to make social media more sociable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article appears in the August 2019 print edition with the headline “Wait a Minute.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/Nqv9eBhKpUo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Jonathan Rauch</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/jonathan-rauch/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/07/Atlantic_Instanticity_final_2/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Tyler Comrie</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Twitter Needs a Pause Button</title><published>2019-07-10T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-10T08:00:01-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Instantaneous communication can be destructive.

A new report from Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/07/fbi-ice-find-state-drivers-license-photos-are-gold-mine-facial-recognition-searches/"&gt;requested access to DMV databases&lt;/a&gt; in Utah, Washington State, and Vermont, with the intention of using facial-recognition technology to scan drivers’ photos and match them against criminal and residency databases without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Three years ago, the center revealed that &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/the-perpetual-lineup-half-of-us-adults-in-a-face-recognition-database/"&gt;nearly half of all&lt;/a&gt; U.S. adults are already in the FBI’s facial-recognition database, which is largely sourced from DMV photos. The documents uncovered this week are the first confirmation that states have granted ICE specifically, not just the FBI, access to those databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Vermont and Utah both complied with ICE’s request, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/us/politics/ice-drivers-licenses-facial-recognition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;; in Washington, it’s unclear whether the searches happened after being authorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The implications for undocumented immigrants are stark: Utah, Washington, and Vermont are among the 12 states that &lt;a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/immigration/states-offering-driver-s-licenses-to-immigrants.aspx"&gt;don’t require documentation to obtain a driver’s license&lt;/a&gt;. What may have seemed like an olive branch to allow easier access to driving and identification now could be an invitation for investigation, arrest, or deportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The purpose of driver’s licenses is to keep people safe, not to enable ICE to terrorize immigrant communities,” says Jake Snow, a technology and civil-liberties attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. “Neither Congress nor the states have ever legislatively authorized this conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the surveillance apparatus is remarkable precisely because it doesn’t just ensnare those who have broken the law. When state officials hand over access to public databases with drivers’ photos or license-plate images, they aren’t relinquishing the information of only guilty parties. The &lt;a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/hf/pl11028/chapter4.cfm"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of American adults have driver’s licenses. These scans will include an overwhelming number of drivers who have never been accused of a crime. DMV information essentially offers law enforcement the unchecked ability to search without a warrant. In effect, these license databases have become criminal databases, each search justified by the chance that someone documented there is guilty of a crime. Everyone in them has become a suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And though this is the first news of ICE using driver’s-license photos for facial recognition, the agency already has access to public information via other means. For example, Vigilant Solutions, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18262141/ice-license-plate-reader-database-aclu-emails"&gt;maintains the country’s largest&lt;/a&gt; database of license-plate photos, contracts with ICE, allowing agents to query a license plate and receive a log of everywhere it’s been spotted by license-plate-reading cameras. Vigilant also used its cameras to gather data from California malls, an action it initially &lt;a href="https://www.vigilantsolutions.com/eff-stop-creating-fake-news-scaring-people/"&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; until its parent company, Motorola Solutions, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/03/heres-why-you-cant-trust-what-cops-and-companies-claim-about-automated-license"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that the allegation was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;All told, we are heading toward a future where every ritual of public life carries implicit consent to be surveilled: Obtaining a license, driving a car, shopping in a mall, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/universities-record-students-campuses-research/592537/?utm_source=feed"&gt;walking across a college campus&lt;/a&gt; or city block all open one up to tracking and database matching of some kind. Opting out would mean nonparticipation in society—a consequence much more dire than the invasion of privacy. When participating in daily life means being searched, law enforcement ceases to presume that the public is innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/UJ0X1dUbbQk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Sidney Fussell</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sidney-fussell/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/AP_17044803991198/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Bryan Cox / AP</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">ICE and the Ever-Widening Surveillance Dragnet</title><published>2019-07-10T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-10T10:18:14-04:00</updated><summary type="html">ICE agents have used facial-recognition technology on state driver’s-license photos, turning a public database into a de facto criminal database.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/UJ0X1dUbbQk/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/three-states-granted-ice-access-dmv-photos/593509/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593230</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The most talked-about teen influencer in the world doesn't airbrush her photos. She doesn’t have a team of editors and photographers following her around and taking aspirational “&lt;a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/183390/plandid-instagram-pose-kylie-jenner-bella-hadid-how-to-do-it-right"&gt;plandids&lt;/a&gt;.” In fact, she doesn’t make her life seem very aspirational at all: In many of her videos, she looks like she just rolled out of bed. Emma Chamberlain shuns makeup, sometimes skips a shower, and doesn’t seem to care if she looks weird or if her camera is poised at an unflattering angle. While other YouTube stars—like Jake and Logan Paul, Bethany Mota, and Lele Pons—rely on hyper-produced, staged videos with bright thumbnails and clickbait titles, Chamberlain posts lo-fi vlogs using default fonts, clashing color schemes, and lowercase titles that never overpromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;All of this has gained the 18-year-old some 8 million YouTube subscribers and 7.7 million Instagram followers in less than two years; her YouTube channel is one of the fastest growing in the U.S., according to the company. The analytics site &lt;a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg"&gt;SocialBlade&lt;/a&gt; estimates Chamberlain may be earning nearly $2 million in ad revenue on her YouTube videos alone. In the past year, she launched a podcast that promptly &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebrity/youtube-star-emma-chamberlain-new-podcast-number-one-50-countries/"&gt;hit No. 1 on podcast charts in 50 countries&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a line of self-branded &lt;a href="https://shopemmachamberlain.com/collections/all"&gt;merchandise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0wpTx6kUPE"&gt;attended Paris Fashion Week&lt;/a&gt;, where she was &lt;a href="https://www.j-14.com/posts/louis-vuitton-cruise-2020-show-emma-chamberlain-joe-jonas-more/"&gt;seated in the front row&lt;/a&gt; at the Louis Vuitton show. “Her growth has been so fucking insane,” says Mai Linh Nguyen, a producer and YouTube strategist who has worked for many top YouTubers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even if you haven’t seen one of Chamberlain’s videos, you’ve likely seen traces of her influence all over the internet. She’s the closest thing to an overnight success YouTube has had in years, and represents a dramatic shift in what young audiences want from the platform and its top creators: videos that feel authentic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many modern YouTube stars first got big on other platforms, like Vine or Instagram, or appeared in collaborations with other, more famous stars, which built their audience over time. Chamberlain, on the other hand, is sui generis, which is surely part of her appeal. She started out editing cheerleading videos and dance routines with friends and posting them to Instagram before moving to YouTube; by all accounts, the platform wasn’t a place to launch an entertainment career, but rather just another place to express herself, via low-production-value fashion videos and vlogs about daily tribulations of teenage life, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqv_vKMjiUQ"&gt;taking her driving test&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt77_80W10E"&gt;why she needed a fidget spinner&lt;/a&gt;. Her first subscriber was her dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfJxAMMjevn/" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of Chamberlain’s early videos netted about 1,000 viewers each, but on July 27, 2017, she uploaded a video that would change her life, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5-6f1T9qsc" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;a dollar-store “haul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;." “That was apparently a YouTube trend at the time, and it ended up working in my favor,” she told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/emma-chamberlain-youtube-interview" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;&lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; last month&lt;span&gt;. (Chamberlain wasn’t available for an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;). Haul videos were indeed cresting then, but most featured smiling beauty or fashion vloggers carefully displaying all the amazing products they'd purchased for the camera. Chamberlain's version was irreverent, weird, and slightly demented—a half-ironic, half-earnest cataloging of all the Frozen-themed Q-tips and fur-covered pens her allowance could buy. It got half a million views. After that, she began gaining tens of thousands of subscribers a month. Teen girls couldn't get enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Aesthetically, Chamberlain’s style is fast, jumpy, and very funny; she favors quick cuts, facial distortions, unaligned fonts, goofy music, and effects similar to the Superzoom feature on Instagram Stories. Throughout her vlogs she intersperses reaction shots of herself while she’s editing, or old clips of herself, giving voice to what the audience might be thinking as they watch. “She has stuff going on every four seconds,” says Sara Dietschy, a YouTuber with more than half a million subscribers. “It makes it so that a 17-minute video seems like you just blinked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s a very memey editing style,” Nguyen says. She formerly worked as a videographer for Jake Paul, a job that included editing footage and photos for social media. “I’d take photos on a Monday night at 6 p.m., and they’d be ready to go at 10 p.m. that night to be posted that morning,” she told me. “If [Chamberlain] is taking a photo at 4 p.m. on a Saturday, it’s up five minutes later with no editing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The shift away from hyper-posed, overedited content has been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/influencers-are-abandoning-instagram-look/587803/?utm_source=feed"&gt;happening on Instagram for a while&lt;/a&gt;. But Chamberlain is credited with being the one who popularized it on YouTube, and her popularity growth is very much a reaction to the traditional influencer-style content that had become so pervasive before her. Chamberlain is relatable, her fans say: Unlike those &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; YouTubers living in mansions with perfect hair and expensive clothes, she’s just an average teen. Sure, she lives in L.A. herself now and is undoubtedly a multimillionaire, but the point is, she doesn’t &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;. She doesn’t take herself so seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The thing that feels so notable is that [Chamberlain’s videos] are the first generation of reaction against things that were established in this medium,” says Kevin Allocca, the head of culture and trends at YouTube. “You have this creative counterculture that counters a culture we were just getting used to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbUnuR02hJY" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Fans call the style “slacker YouTube” or “relatable YouTube,” and Chamberlain is no longer its only high-profile practitioner. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkin59aR57-RgqvN04jHSIg"&gt;Joana Ceddia&lt;/a&gt;, an 18-year-old YouTuber, &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/joana-ceddia-new-youtube-star/"&gt;gained more than 107,000 subscribers in less than 48 hours&lt;/a&gt; last fall and has since racked up more than 2.3 million in less than a year by posting quirky videos of her life as an average teen. Others include &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiM8OI8ySYAoealLy-YRCbg"&gt;Summer McKeen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hannahmeloche"&gt;Hannah Meloche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/berrypinklips"&gt;Hailey Sani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCphp36eGq0lzmZBCaepuX7g"&gt;Ellie Thuman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sodapop738"&gt;Haley Pham&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve been on the platform for over 10 years,” says Alisha Marie, a YouTuber with more than 8 million subscribers, “but I feel like there’s this new wave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The aesthetic has made its way to pop music too. The 17-year-old musician Billie Eilish has one of the best-selling records in the country right now, and an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw3iweXlarz/"&gt;Instagram full of unposed photos of herself in baggy clothing.&lt;/a&gt; Ariana Grande recently put out a music video for her song &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0pryRrJvfI"&gt;Monopoly&lt;/a&gt; that features a Chamberlain-esque jumble of low-quality video, bouncing JPEGs, and sped-up sequences. Even brands are trying to trying to cash in: Chamberlain has now done ads for Curology, Hollister, and Audible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a big shift for a platform that was, until recently, “a super-high-production place where you were buying these expensive tools to make your videos seem high value,” Abby Adesanya, the head of talent and influencers for Bustle Digital Group told me. “If you look at beauty-vlogger videos, some of their most popular videos are ‘what is my setup,’ and you’ll see these big-box lights, a DSLR camera. That’s what YouTube was. Then Emma came along with her iPhone, laying in bed editing with food on her chest and was like, ‘I’m not going to curate myself like that.’ And people just loved it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Making a video look casual, however, is still an enormous amount of work. Chamberlain reportedly spends 20 to 30 hours editing each video and does all the work herself. “I’ve cried multiple times after posting a video,” she told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/emma-chamberlain-youtube-interview"&gt;W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “So much work goes into each video that I don’t know how I’m still alive.” Summer McKeen, a 20-year-old with more than 2.3 million subscribers on YouTube, also spends hours on each of her videos. “It’s the same amount of work as the old way,” she told me. “It’s just a more casual feel to the video.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXiPKeK5_L8" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Of course, “relatable” is relative. In one video called “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQRvJCO1nd0"&gt;The Relatable White Girl Trend&lt;/a&gt;,” a young black vlogger who goes by AsToldByKenya on YouTube skewers the style: “You have to be pretty; you have to be funny. You have to curse but not curse too much that you’re seen as vulgar, but you still have to curse to be seen as relatable. You have to have cute outfits. Your outfits have to be from Urban Outfitters, honey … You have to be attractive to boys, but not actually come across like you’re attractive to boys.” In another video, titled “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSGEWXIzVzo&amp;amp;t=13s&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR03g9MJT-EOYjlEVPFZk5n_tR7AnvR7aI5VqzwYkGGOnhKT9zFUmYBdQjs"&gt;I Was a Relatable Youtuber for a Day! *cough* Emma Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;,” Don Bbw, a young black YouTuber, says, “I actually don’t know what’s relatable, because what’s relatable to you might not be relatable to me,” before joking that he “forgot the most relatable part of being a relatable YouTuber, having a pimple.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I feel like that [Emma Chamberlain] aesthetic trend is definitely a suburban white girl trend,” said Adesanya, adding that the look is something YouTubers of color mostly &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/youtubers-accusing-fashion-brand-dote-of-segregating"&gt;don’t have access to&lt;/a&gt;. “These YouTubers of color, their whole vibe is received so differently than the Summers and the Hannahs and the Emmas.” (Chamberlain has not been particularly outspoken about race, but &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katetalbot/2019/06/02/diversity-in-influencer-marketing-why-representation-matters/#14d7e7fc7a3e"&gt;did cut ties&lt;/a&gt; with a partner, Dote, after black influencers &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/youtubers-accusing-fashion-brand-dote-of-segregating"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the clothing brand of segregating them from white influencers at the brand’s Coachella house.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While Chamberlain’s particular style may not feel accessible to all, the broader shift toward messier, less filtered content is bigger than one star or one look. “Millennials are so curated, and Gen Z is very not,” said Adesanya. “Millennials used social media as a highlight reel … Gen Z is like, ‘Hey, this is what I’m doing right now, this is what I look like right now.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And for many young creators, Chamberlain’s style is simply the default way to vlog. “I don’t feel like I need to put on a different face or put on an act when I’m filming,” said McKeen, who has been vlogging since she was 13. “I just feel like I’m hanging out with my friends. My camera is my friend. It's always been that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/IUfpSxAkHak" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Taylor Lorenz</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/taylor-lorenz/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/chamberlain_yell/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Emma Chamberlain</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Emma Chamberlain Is the Most Important YouTuber Today</title><published>2019-07-03T07:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-14T15:21:42-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Teens are abandoning hyper-produced personalities for people who seem just like them.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/IUfpSxAkHak/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/emma-chamberlain-and-rise-relatable-influencer/593230/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-593026</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/pride-month-stonewall/?utm_source=feed"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; about the gay-rights movement and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In early June, during an otherwise unremarkable safety briefing at New York Police Department headquarters in Lower Manhattan, Police Commissioner James O’Neill stood in front of a crowd and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/nyregion/stonewall-riots-apology-nypd.html"&gt;apologized for his department’s behavior&lt;/a&gt; during the Stonewall riots, some 50 years ago. “The actions and the laws were discriminatory and oppressive,” he said, “and for that, I apologize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The apology was surprising after a long legacy of “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/?utm_source=feed"&gt;broken windows&lt;/a&gt;” policing and “cleaning up the streets” initiatives targeted at LGBTQ New Yorkers. Before the riots at the Stonewall Inn, queer people across the country were sacrificed to these initiatives, marked as criminals. But because they were breaking the law—no matter how unjust—surveilling them was, in that era, a sign of a safe community. Now the laws are gone, but the surveillance continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;New York City imposed anti-sodomy laws on its residents &lt;a href="https://archive.is/20120707134658/http://174.123.24.242/leagle/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=198052751NY2d476_1481.xml&amp;amp;docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985"&gt;until 1980&lt;/a&gt; and cross-dressing &lt;a href="https://casetext.com/case/people-v-archibald-6"&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; until 2011. For decades, the city selectively enforced liquor regulations &lt;a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/stonewall-national-monument-lgbt-rights-equality/"&gt;to discriminate&lt;/a&gt; against gay bars. Those policies all served as pretense for continual police surveillance and frequent raids. It was never the individual homophobia of police officers that caused the Stonewall riots, but the homophobia enshrined in the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By the 1960s, every state in the U.S. had anti-sodomy laws &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/why-sodomy-laws-matter"&gt;on the books&lt;/a&gt;. As many gay men moved to metropolitan areas such as New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., police in these cities endeavored to look tough on gay life. Each city created positions for “vice officers” or “morality officers,” who used decoy and entrapment techniques to arrest gay men. The intense surveillance of gay bars for such routine behavior as kissing has been likened by contemporary legal scholars to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/107/2/576/195690"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;Read: &lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/before-stonewall-biggest-threat-was-entrapment/590536/?utm_source=feed"&gt;The forgotten history of gay entrapment&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Homophobic laws and political tactics forced LGBTQ people to hide themselves—while at the same time, police agencies and conservative groups spread fears that predatory gays were hidden among upstanding citizens. As queer folks receded into the closet to survive, police developed concealed tactics to find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 1962, police in Mansfield, Ohio, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1741659009346048"&gt;received complaints&lt;/a&gt; that men were cruising in a public bathroom late at night. With no warrant, no witnesses, and certainly no victims, police installed hidden cameras behind the bathroom mirror. Officers angled the lenses so as to see the faces of all the men who entered, arresting the men they found having sex and spying on dozens who simply stopped to use the restroom. This wasn’t an entirely uncommon practice. In Toronto in 1979, a vice officer &lt;a href="http://activehistory.ca/2017/02/policing-gay-sex-in-toronto/"&gt;was assigned to peer&lt;/a&gt; through grates in the bathroom of the Parkside Tavern, a well-known gay bar and cruising site. Police could see everyone using the bathroom and arrested anyone they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Years earlier, in late-spring 1952, Dale Jennings, a World War II veteran and playwright, had &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/22/us/william-dale-jennings-82-writer-and-gay-rights-pioneer.html?mtrref=www.google.com"&gt;stopped to use a bathroom&lt;/a&gt; in a D.C. public park. There, another man at the stalls made eye contact. Jennings claimed the stranger had grabbed his hand and placed it down the front of his pants. When Jennings left, the man followed him home, making small talk about the Navy. Once they arrived, the stranger revealed himself as a police officer and arrested Jennings for lewd misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jennings made history by fighting his charge in court, a rarity for a lewd-conduct arrest in that age. Many men caught in these entrapment schemes were closeted and accepted fines and plea deals rather than fighting charges in a public trial, where they could be outed and harassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The jury deadlocked 11 to one in favor of acquittal, and Jennings was released. Soon after, he formed the Mattachine Society, an early “homophile” organization, and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeLdxm7nKq-/?hl=en"&gt;the Citizens’ Committee to Outlaw Entrapment&lt;/a&gt;, which offered legal advice to other men similarly arrested by decoy officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The irony of the decoy arrest is that police officers were engaging in the very behavior they claimed to be preventing: loitering in bathrooms, indecent exposure, and making sexual advances to strangers. But because so few men contested the charges, entrapment schemes became an easy way to arrest and charge dozens of gay men with fines, thereby proving that officers were doing their jobs and keeping the streets safe. This continued for decades, even after Stonewall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In March 1978, Boston police &lt;a href="https://www.glad.org/cases/doe-v-mcniff/"&gt;sent plainclothes officers&lt;/a&gt; to the Boston Public Library’s bathroom to stop cruising at the site. Over a two-week period, 103 men were arrested and accused of lewd conduct, public indecency, or prostitution. Among the arrests, only one man was actually found guilty, and his conviction was overturned in court. Another man, arrested and &lt;a href="https://www.glad.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GCN_man_sues_boston.pdf"&gt;charged with prostitution&lt;/a&gt; but later found not guilty, sued the library and Boston police officials, ultimately winning a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the harassment and over-policing of queer men was meant to signal a healthy community and robust police force for much of the 20th century, Stonewall brought visibility to the injustices of overzealous police. Fifty years later, cities no longer presume that police are innocent, or that LGBTQ people are criminals. But that doesn’t mean everything has changed. Entrapment tactics still continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2007, the NYPD and New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1741659009346048"&gt;sent undercover agents&lt;/a&gt; to gay bars to document the age, race, and appearance of each person they alleged engaged in sex. In 2014, a judge rebuked the police department in Long Beach, California, after it &lt;a href="https://qvoicenews.com/2017/04/29/long-beach-police-discriminate-against-gay-men-in-undercover-sting-operations-judge-says/"&gt;admitted to using plainclothes&lt;/a&gt; officers and sting operations to arrest gay men for lewd-conduct charges. In 2017, a group of gay men filed &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/28/new-york-port-authority-police-gay-men-discrimination"&gt;a class-action suit&lt;/a&gt; against the Port Authority Police Department for allegedly using decoy officers to entrap and arrest gay men for lewd conduct and exposure. The lawsuit is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stonewall was not a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/mar/17/the-extraordinary-rise-of-drag-brunch-a-dining-delight-or-a-betrayal-of-queer-history"&gt;drag brunch&lt;/a&gt;. It was a riot against police intrusion, surveillance, and the feedback loops that kept LGBTQ people in the closet and out of politics. It marked the start of a long march to invert the logic of law enforcement as harassment: Attacking and arresting queer people is a sign not of a city under control, but of corruption, corrosion, and a force that lacks integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/tyQVGnauOTo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Sidney Fussell</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sidney-fussell/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/GettyImages_661695126/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Grey Villet / The LIFE Picture Collection / Getty Images</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">How Stonewall Reversed a Long History of Justifying Police Surveillance</title><published>2019-06-29T13:07:23-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-01T08:53:20-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Entrapment schemes targeting gay men continue across the country, but the Stonewall resistance changed their meaning.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/tyQVGnauOTo/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/how-police-surveillance-led-stonewall/593026/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592558</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Your face is no longer just your face—it’s been augmented.

Lawmakers are weighing the risks versus rewards, with a recent wave of proposed regulation in Washington State, Massachusetts, Oakland, and the U.S. legislature. In May, Republicans and Democrats in the House Committee on Oversight and Reform heard hours of testimony about how unregulated facial recognition already &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/masks-cash-and-apps-how-hong-kongs-protesters-find-ways-to-outwit-the-surveillance-state/2019/06/15/8229169c-8ea0-11e9-b6f4-033356502dce_story.html?utm_term=.227c5ebba0b5"&gt;tracks protesters&lt;/a&gt;, impacts the &lt;a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/news/clare-garvie-l15-of-the-center-on-privacy-technology-continues-groundbreaking-work-on-police-facial-recognition/"&gt;criminal-justice system&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html"&gt;exacerbates racial biases&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, they agreed to work together to regulate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“You’ve hit the sweet spot that brings progressives and conservatives together,” Republican Mark Meadows of North Carolina said at the hearing. “The time is now, before it gets out of control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Agreement is shocking in a political moment defined by polarization, but lightning has seemingly struck twice. Microsoft and Amazon, the makers of Face API and Rekognition software, respectively, also both &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-joins-microsofts-call-rules-facial-recognition/"&gt;endorse federal regulation&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Axon, the number-one body-camera manufacturer in the United States, agreed with its ethics board’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/opinion/police-cam-facial-recognition.html"&gt;proposal not to&lt;/a&gt; outfit Axon cameras with facial recognition (at least for the foreseeable future). The Microsoft president Brad Smith &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/06/facial-recognition-its-time-for-action/"&gt;called for governments “to start adopting laws to regulate this technology”&lt;/a&gt; last year, while the Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy echoed those comments in June, &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/andy-jassy-no-on-aws-spinoff-yes-on-facial-recognition-regs?itc=refresh"&gt;likening the technology&lt;/a&gt; to a knife. It’s a less dramatic image than the &lt;a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2019-04/facial-recognition-plutonium-ai"&gt;plutonium and nuclear-waste&lt;/a&gt; metaphors critics employ, but his message—coming from an executive at one of the world’s most powerful facial-recognition technology outfits—is clear: This stuff is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But crucially, Jassy and Smith seem to argue, it’s also inevitable. In calling for regulation, Microsoft and Amazon have pulled a neat trick: Instead of making the debate about &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; facial recognition should be widely adopted, they’ve made it about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; such adoption would work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon said it’s working with researchers, lawmakers, and its customers “to understand how to best balance the benefits of facial recognition with the potential risks,” noting that Rekognition has a variety of uses, including fighting human trafficking and finding missing persons. Microsoft reiterated statements from Smith in support of facial-recognition regulation, &lt;a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/17/six-principles-to-guide-microsofts-facial-recognition-work/"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; implementing safeguards against reported misuse and securing consent from anyone who is the target of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/universities-record-students-campuses-research/592537/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: You no longer own your face&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But some privacy experts believe the companies have ulterior motives. Evan Selinger, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, accuses Microsoft and Amazon of trying to “suck out the motivation” for robust regulation. He argues that companies are pushing for regulation at the federal level because national laws are typically written to be floors, not ceilings—baseline measures that are less likely than local legislation to include restrictions for how private companies use the tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Federal rules don’t prohibit local and strong regulations,” Selinger says. “But you get to raise the flag of mission accomplished [and] make it seem like people who want something stronger than what’s been enacted at a federal level are extremists.” Turning bipartisan agreement itself—not robust legislation—into the goal can, as Seligner puts it, “take the wind out of the sails for local [regulation] so people won’t feel as motivated, because they think there’s been change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Without regulation, the potential for misuse of facial-recognition technology is high, particularly for people of color. In 2016 the MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini published research showing that tech performs better on lighter-skinned men than on darker-skinned men, and performs worst on darker-skinned women. When the ACLU &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28"&gt;matched Congress members&lt;/a&gt; against a criminal database, Amazon’s Rekognition software misidentified black Congress members more often than white ones, despite there being far fewer black members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This includes House Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Baltimore native whose face was also scanned when he attended a 2015 rally in memory of Freddie Gray, the unarmed black teenager who &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-mysterious-death-of-freddie-gray/391119/?utm_source=feed"&gt;died of a spinal-cord injury while in police custody&lt;/a&gt;. The Baltimore Police Department &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/eyes-over-baltimore-how-police-use-military-technology-to-secretly-track-you-126885/"&gt;used facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; to identify protesters and target any with outstanding warrants. Most of the protesters were black, meaning the software used on them might have been less accurate, increasing the likelihood of misidentification. Expert witnesses at the committee hearing in May warned of a chilling effect: Protesters, wary of being identified via facial recognition and matched against criminal databases, could choose to stay home rather than exercise their freedom of assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft and Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/amazon-facial-technology-study.html"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; claim to have &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/gender-skin-tone-facial-recognition-improvement/?utm_source=social-share"&gt;lessened&lt;/a&gt; the racial disparity in accuracy since the original MIT study and the ACLU’s report. But fine-tuning the technology to better recognize black faces is only part of the process: Perfectly accurate technology could still be used to support harmful policing, which affects people of color. The racial-accuracy problem is a distraction; how the technology is used matters, and that’s where policy could prevent abuse. And the solution Microsoft and Amazon &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/12/06/facial-recognition-its-time-for-action/"&gt;propose&lt;/a&gt; would require auditing face recognition for racial and gender biases after they’re already in use—which might be too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In early May, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/30/amazons-facial-recognition-technology-is-supercharging-local-police/"&gt;reported that police&lt;/a&gt; were feeding forensic sketches to their facial-recognition software. A witness described a suspect to a sketch artist, then police uploaded the sketch to Amazon’s Rekognition, looking for hits, and eventually arrested someone. Experts at the congressional hearing in May were shocked that a sketch submitted to a database could credibly qualify as enough reasonable suspicion to arrest someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/half-of-american-adults-are-in-police-facial-recognition-databases/504560/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Half of American adults are in police facial-recognition databases&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But Jassy, the Amazon Web Services CEO, claimed that Amazon has never received a report of police misuse. In May, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/05/22/amazon-facial-recognition-shareholders-reject-banning-software-sales/3770927002/"&gt;shareholders voted down&lt;/a&gt; a proposal that would ban the sale of Rekognition to police, and halt sales to law enforcement and ICE. Jassy said that police should only rely on Rekognition results when the system is 99 percent confident in the accuracy of a match. This is a potentially critical safeguard against misidentification, but it’s just a suggestion: Amazon doesn’t require police to adhere to this threshold, or even ask. In January, &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; quoted an Oregon sheriff’s official saying his department &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/defense-of-amazons-face-recognition-tool-undermined-by-1832238149"&gt;ignores thresholds&lt;/a&gt; completely. (“There has never been a single reported complaint from the public and no issues with the local constituency around their use of Rekognition,” a representative from Amazon said, in part, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And as the discussions around the specifics of implementation swirl, critics argue that they are a diversion from larger, worthier discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We have seen a wave of technology companies pivoting towards public messaging suggesting support for more community-centric and civil-rights-protective regulations around technologies such as face surveillance, while at the same time working to undermine those very protections in actual legislation,” says Shankar Narayan, the Technology and Liberty Project director at the ACLU Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So far, technology companies have succeeded in setting the terms of the debate over facial recognition. But these might be the last days of privately owning our own faces. Common ground itself is not a victory. Narrowing the discussion isn’t compromise; it’s a rhetorical trick. It turns public governance into a terms-of-service agreement: One party sets the terms while the other, uninterested and resigned to the inevitable, simply says, “I agree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/H8JH2hlGjP4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Sidney Fussell</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sidney-fussell/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/GettyImages_1155507259/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Alex Wong / Getty Images</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Strange Politics of Facial Recognition</title><published>2019-06-28T14:41:36-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-29T12:57:21-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Everyone seems to have found common ground on the emerging technology.

The 60-second constraint the network imposed on the 10 candidates meant that responses would have to be formed from preplanned atoms of ideas, cleverly fused into stable molecules of coherent political appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s nothing new when it comes to television news, a medium long known, and criticized, for distilling discourse into sound bites. But in previous eras of newscasting, those nibbles were extracted from longer streams of conversation. One-liners meant to glorify or shame would get extracted later from morning-show interviews or campaign-trail speeches. They didn’t just come into the world naked and alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/2020-candidates-president-guide/582598/?utm_source=feed"&gt;enough&lt;/a&gt; Democratic candidates gunning for the White House to form two football squads, a minimum polling or fundraising &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/12/18660068/democratic-debates-2019-candidates-rules-lineup"&gt;qualification&lt;/a&gt; was imposed, narrowing the field to merely two basketball courts’ worth of contenders. Even split over two nights, the 10 lecterns on stage at Miami’s Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts made the theater look more like the opening trial of the Hunger Games than a political stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To succeed in this context—if indeed any successes befell the field, let alone the electorate—requires a precise execution that looks more like internet speech than it does television conversation. The only way to win in this media context is to produce a meme-worthy victory from your own mouth, or to force your opponents to fall into a memeable gaffe. For an idea or action to be real, let alone coherent, it must be created for the express purpose of escaping its original context and living on as a social-media virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"&gt;

Confused by cacophony, Michael Bennet, the senator from Colorado, at one point asked of his question, “Was that for me?” The entrepreneur Andrew Yang had a similar moment of confusion—“Sorry?” he asked in panic—as if he hadn’t even expected to receive a question. Later, Yang would let slip, “They’re laughing their asses off,” in reference to Russia, seeming to realize in the moment that maybe he shouldn’t have said “ass” in his first major appeal to America on live television. At one point Marianne Williamson reasonably thought she was being addressed and, confused, began to respond. “I’m sorry,” she said softly, then concluding, “Oh,” as she looked to former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper on her left, to whom a question about border detention actually had been addressed. These and similar moments quickly enjoyed spirited afterlives on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other bits were memed by the debate format. Given the enormous field, NBC chose to pose some “Raise your hand if …” questions to the whole stage at once. Those shots themselves are easy to remix and reframe online—a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JacobDVandever/status/1144422081611755520"&gt;good tweet&lt;/a&gt; captioned one image of all the candidates’ hands in the air with, “Raise your hand if you’ve ever been personally victimized by Regina George,” the antagonist of the 2004 film &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt;. Joe Biden’s tendency to raise his hand slowly, with apparent uncertainty, also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/victory_boat/status/1144421778883776512"&gt;enjoyed pickup&lt;/a&gt;: “Biden is doing the half hand raise you did in school when you didn’t really want to get called on but everyone else was raising their hands for all of these ‘raise your hands’ questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/bernie-sanders-socialism-debate-democrats/592900/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Bernie Sanders’s ideas dominated the second debate&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden got absolutely roasted by Eric Swalwell, the representative from California. “I was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans,” Swalwell said. “That candidate was then-Senator Joe Biden.” Later, Kamala Harris &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html"&gt;seared&lt;/a&gt; Biden for his inaction on racial integration. Together, these exchanges birthed a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=biden%20pass%20the%20torch&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;clone army&lt;/a&gt; of meme-aspirants along the lines of, “Swalwell asked to pass the torch; Harris just took it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the meme-iest moment came from another Kamala Harris mic drop. After moderators lost total control of the stage, a cacophony of voices erupted. Taking the proverbial torch, Harris bellowed, “America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we’re going to put food on their tables.” The interjection quelled the clamor, but it also underscored an ironic truth. “It’s funny Kamala Harris says America doesn’t want to see a food fight on the debate stage,” the writer Dan O’Sullivan &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bro_pair/status/1144425026017382401?s=12"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “when in fact that is the whole reason we are all watching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttigieg managed to handle the 60-second answer times well, offering responses that felt concise and complete, no matter how valid or coherent they might have been. He &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/pete-buttigieg-religion/592897/?utm_source=feed&amp;amp;utm_term=2019-06-28T02%3A28%3A07&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR3glq6f2MPC3ZVUgdq8RIlBdkDqlxBex6mIlJkuEpU-zb1w6CwFJOmZsBw"&gt;chastised&lt;/a&gt; the GOP for its hypocritical use of Christianity. He admitted, “I couldn’t get it done,” when asked about the racial composition of his police force. He quipped, “We have no idea which of our most important allies [Trump] will have pissed off most” when asked which foreign relationship he’d try to repair first. But even those moments of lucidity cemented his station as the young nerd of the group. “The senior superlative for most articulate debater goes to...@PeteButtigieg,” Katie Couric &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katiecouric/status/1144423941357875200"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, an ambiguous sneer that perfectly swirls Mayor Pete’s appeal and his inexperience into a delicious, summer soft-serve cone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"&gt;

First, because it condenses large, complex ideas into smaller, simpler ones. And second, because it invites the obsessive, endless stare-down of those ideas. The internet only accelerated those vices, launching ever more, ever smaller notions from anyone’s mouth, and perfecting the psychological apparatus that glues eyeballs to them almost constantly. The television stayed at home, at least, and had to be turned off on occasion. But the smartphone has no limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/second-night-democratic-debates-went-badly/592924/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Frum: The second debate gives Democrats three reasons to worry&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first televised presidential debate, between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960, became famous for shifting the weight of political media from radio to TV. As that debate’s producer, Don Hewitt, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/1960-first-televised-presidential-debate/"&gt;famously explained&lt;/a&gt;, if you consumed the debate by radio, Nixon seemed like the clear winner. But if you watched it on television, Kennedy came out ahead. The senator had taken the medium more seriously than Nixon, for one, but he was also more naturally telegenic than his opponent, who was only four years his senior. Nixon was sick and unprepared, and had refused makeup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to conclude that social media on smartphones has replaced “legacy” media like television in the same way TV once replaced radio, but the truth is more complex and far messier. The media ecosystem has been reformed into a strange slurry of TV and the internet. That tends to amplify the worst features of both the old and the new forms. From television, media retain the ability to reach a massive audience all at once, barraging them with abridged messages that skim the surfaces of deep waters. Then the internet explodes those already compressed notions into shrapnel. For American voters, watching those fragments achieve momentary, clever appeal is far easier and more entertaining than attempting to piece it all back together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As television blends with the internet, without succumbing to it, perhaps the worst feature of the meme debates that result is that there is no equivalent for Don Hewitt’s succinct explanation. The 20-person debate didn’t produce one winner online and another on broadcast news. It got detonated into rubble that cascades across every media channel. In the end, there was no winner save the memes, which rain their hot cunning down on everyone for a brief moment, before evaporating into futility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/QCqxU9EUGxs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ian Bogost</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/Untitled_1/lead_960.png"><media:credit>NBC News / Jacob Drew Vandever / Ian Bogost / &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Raise Your Hand If You’ve Ever Felt Personally Victimized by This Debate</title><published>2019-06-28T11:20:20-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-28T18:14:09-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Political media have abandoned frankness for dankness.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/QCqxU9EUGxs/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/the-memes-won-the-first-democratic-debates/592942/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592537</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If 20 people are in a coffee shop, then there are at least 21 cameras: One embedded in each person’s phone and, usually, one tucked high in the corner. What you say may be overheard and tweeted; you might even appear in the background of another patron’s selfie or Skype session. But that doesn’t stop even the most private people from entering coffee shops. They accept the risk inherent in entering a public place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This notion—of a “reasonable” expectation of privacy—guides researchers hoping to observe subjects in public. But the very idea of what’s reasonable is a complicated one. Faculty at three universities—Duke, Stanford, and the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs—are &lt;a href="https://www.krdo.com/news/top-stories/uccs-professor-defends-facial-recognition-project-that-photographed-unsuspecting-students/1081707547"&gt;facing backlash&lt;/a&gt; after creating databases &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7d3e0d6a-87a0-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2"&gt;built using surveillance footage&lt;/a&gt; of students as they walked through cafes and on college campuses. You might reasonably expect being overheard in a coffee shop, but that’s different from suddenly becoming a research subject, part of a data set that can live forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ethics boards approved all three research projects, which used student data to refine machine-learning algorithms. The Duke University researcher Carlo Tomasi declined an interview with &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, but said &lt;a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2019/06/duke-university-facial-recognition-data-set-study-surveillance-video-students-china-uyghur"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; to the Duke &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; that he “genuinely thought” he was following Institutional Review Board guidelines. For their research, he and his colleagues placed posters at all entrances to public areas, telling people they were being recorded, and providing contact information should they want their data erased. No one reached out, Tomasi told the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/your-data-is-forever/485219/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Your data is forever&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But when the parameters of his research changed, Tomasi admits he didn’t inform the IRB. For minor changes, that’s allowed. But Tomasi got permission to record indoors, not outdoors. And more significantly, he promised to allow access to the database only upon request. Instead, he opened it to anyone to download, he admitted to the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;. “IRB is not to be blamed, as I failed to consult them at critical junctures. I take full responsibility for my mistakes, and I apologize to all the people who were recorded and to Duke for their consequences,” his statement reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Duke ultimately decided to delete the data set related to the research. Stanford did the same thing with a similarly derived data set its researchers created from patrons filmed at a San Francisco café. At UCCS, where researchers recorded students to test identification software, the lead researcher says &lt;a href="https://www.krdo.com/news/top-stories/uccs-professor-defends-facial-recognition-project-that-photographed-unsuspecting-students/1081707547"&gt;the team never collected&lt;/a&gt; individually identifying information. Researchers for the Stanford and UCCS projects didn’t respond to requests for comment. In separate statements, each university reiterated that ethics boards approved all research, and underscored its commitment to student privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the problem is that university ethics boards are inherently limited in their scope. They oversee certain, narrow aspects of how research is conducted, but not always where it ends up. And in the information age, the majority of academic research goes online, and what’s online lives forever. Other researchers, unbound by IRB standards, could download the data set and use it how they wish, introducing all manner of consequences for people with no way of being informed or offering consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Those consequences can be far beyond what researchers imagine. Adam Harvey, a countersurveillance expert in Germany, found more than 100 &lt;a href="https://megapixels.cc/datasets/duke_mtmc/"&gt;machine-learning projects&lt;/a&gt; across the globe that cited Duke’s data set. He created a map that tracked the spread of the data set around the world like a flight tracker, with long blue lines extending from Duke University in every direction. Universities, start-ups, and institutions worldwide &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7d3e0d6a-87a0-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2"&gt;used the data set&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/us-money-funding-facial-recognition-sensetime-megvii"&gt;SenseTime and Megvii,&lt;/a&gt; Chinese surveillance firms linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html"&gt;state repression&lt;/a&gt; of Muslim minorities in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Every time a data set is accessed for a new project, the intention, scope, and potential for harm changes. The portability and pliability of data meet the speed of the internet, massively expanding the possibilities of any one research project, and scaling the risk far beyond what any one university can be held accountable for. For better or worse, they can only regulate the intentions of the original researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The federal government’s Office for Human Research Protections &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/2013-may-20-letter-attachment-b/index.html"&gt;explicitly asks board members&lt;/a&gt; not to consider “possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research.” Instead, they’re asked to focus only on the subjects directly involved in a study. And if those subjects are largely anonymous people briefly idling in a public space, there’s no reason to believe they’ve been explicitly harmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s just not what [the IRB] was designed to do,” says Michelle Meyer, a bioethicist who chairs the IRB Leadership Committee at Geisinger, a major health-care provider in Philadelphia. As she explains, the IRB’s main privacy concern for publicly observed research is whether subjects are individually identified, and if being identified places them at risk of financial or medical harm. “In theory, if you were creating a nuclear bomb and … [conducting research that] involved surveying or interviewing human subjects,” she says, “the risks that the IRB would be considering would be the risks to people immediately involved in the project, not the risk of nuclear annihilation downstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/online-data-brokers/529281/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: I bought a report on everything that’s known about me online &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Opening up data sets for other researchers increases those downstream risks. But the IRB may not have much jurisdiction here; data sharing, fundamentally, is not research. The after-the-fact application of data is not itself research, so it’s “sort of in this weird regulatory twilight zone,” Meyer explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Casey Fiesler, an assistant professor in the information-science department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, writes on the ethics of using public data in research studies. Fiesler proposed a system for scrutinizing data-set access that’s similar to copyright use. Fair-use clauses are subjective, she notes, but have standards based on how the requester plans to use the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Having some kind of gatekeeper for these data sets is a good idea,” she says, “because [requesters] can have access if you tell us what you’ll do with it.” Similar rules are in place for open-source software and Creative Commons intellectual property, a permission-based system where requesters can use media only for noncommercial work that builds on the original without copying it, and are liable if they lie or misrepresent their intentions. Those are subjective metrics that don’t immediately jibe with the highly bureaucratized academic landscape, but can be useful at least in trying to imagine cutting off downstream harm. “This isn’t to suggest [burdensome] rules, but it suggests a way that you should take certain contextual factors into account when you’re making decisions about what you’re going to do,” Fiesler says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/XCuzc_hGbfI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Sidney Fussell</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sidney-fussell/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/RTX6GALB/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Thomas Peter / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">You No Longer Own Your Face</title><published>2019-06-27T15:07:02-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-28T10:09:54-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Students were recorded for research—and then became part of a data set that lives forever online, potentially accessible to anyone.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/XCuzc_hGbfI/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/universities-record-students-campuses-research/592537/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-592585</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have an old Jeep that’s on its last legs. We’ve rebuilt the transmission and replaced most of the suspension, at a cost that far outstrips the hypothetical value of the car. It runs, but just. It burns oil like a refinery and gets terrible gas mileage to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing it with an electric car seems like a no-brainer. Used lease returns for the less expensive models, such as the Nissan Leaf or Fiat 500e, can be cheap—less than $10,000 in some cases—and come with less than 30,000 miles. But they pose other problems, largely related to the fact that electric vehicles (EVs) don’t operate like traditional cars. Many of the early models you can now buy used have ranges less than 90 miles a charge, for one. Some can’t use the fastest public chargers. The standard 110-volt outlet in my garage would take about 24 hours to fully charge one of these cars. I could add a 240-volt outlet, but my circuit box is full, so I’d need to spend a lot more money to add a subpanel. Used EVs tend to appear in the markets where they were first introduced, California especially. But with such a small range, you can’t drive one cross-country; it has to be shipped. That’s more money. The range is plenty for city driving, but what if my older daughter wants to take it to school? That would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There really aren’t that many differences between an electric car and one with an internal combustion engine. It doesn’t have an engine or a gearbox, which gives it a lot more torque at low speeds. And it doesn’t use fuel, of course, but has a battery that needs to be charged. That’s about it. But those differences have an outsized impact on the electric-vehicle ecosystem. Drivers will have to acclimate to that ecosystem for EVs to become mass-market compatible, and the industry knows it, so it’s trying to get ahead of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you buy a gas-fueled car, you operate it the same way every owner has for a century. It can drive for many hundreds of miles before refueling. If it needs gas, you go to a gas station—they’re everywhere. If you want to tour the great American road, you don’t even think of, let alone worry about, where you’ll be able to make a pit stop. None of that is true for electric vehicles; not yet, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you make an EV purchase, you have to ask: ‘What’s the range, what’s the battery life, and is there a charging infrastructure at my home, at my work, or in between that will accommodate my lifestyle?’” Chris Womack, an executive vice president at the utility Southern Company, explained on Tuesday during a panel at the Aspen Ideas Festival, co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. For most people, especially city dwellers, even EVs with a short range are enough to get them to work and back. Jonathan Levy, a vice president at the vehicle-charging-station company EVgo, pointed out that the average commute is about &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/973a2Traffic.pdf"&gt;30 miles a day&lt;/a&gt;. “Sipping on 110v is fine for many people,” Levy said, “supplementing at work and with fast-charging in public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the average reality might not be enough to quell the concerns of potential EV consumers, who will have to wean themselves from the expectations of the internal-combustion era. Some of that change introduces more convenience: You can’t fuel up your car at home, but you can charge it there, even if it’s only via the slow drip of a standard electrical outlet. But away from home, not knowing where a charging point might be introduces new uncertainties to driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Womack’s co-workers drives an electric vehicle, and she can charge it at work. But one day her child got sick at day care. “It screwed up the whole day,” Womack said. The co-worker had to ask herself, “Do I have enough power to get to day care, to the doctor, back to day care, and back to work and then home?” Eventually, there might be a charging station at the day care and the doctor’s office. In Atlanta, where Southern Company is based, a 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10258/1338?backlist=/"&gt;ordinance&lt;/a&gt; requires 20 percent of parking spaces in new buildings to be EV-ready. But for now, the matter still requires a bit of calculation and nail-biting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cody Thacker, the head of electrification at Audi of America, about 80 to 90 percent of EV charging happens at home. But the fear of running out of charge—like the fear of running out of gas—can still drive consumer habits. And the rush to deliver electric vehicles and EV services has created some problems as it’s solved others. Not all vehicles can use the same charging apparatus, for example. Thacker calls this a “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/vrc-is-dead/492992/?utm_source=feed"&gt;VHS/Betamax &lt;/a&gt;moment,” and hopes that standards will emerge as more manufacturers roll out more cars. Audi, for its part, is investing $36 billion in five new EV models over the next five years. And even if you can find a fast-charging station at work or at the grocery store, different companies sometimes operate those services. Imagine if you had to have two different accounts to get gas at a Shell station and a Chevron. That might standardize, too—earlier this month, two major EV-charging networks, ChargePoint and Electrify America, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/06/electric-car-charging-in-america-just-got-a-little-bit-easier/"&gt;announced a plan&lt;/a&gt; to make their services interoperable. That’s good news, but it’s also bizarre that you can’t just swipe a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the EV market is expanding beyond those who can afford Teslas, manufacturers are realizing that they can’t assume these challenges will resolve themselves on their own. That means an automaker like Audi has to press into new terrain, including advocating for open standards among charging services and helping consumers prepare for an EV future. On the latter front, the company has partnered with Amazon Home Services to make getting 240-volt circuits installed in garages easier. It’s a start, but not enough. “If the average American garage is not capable of EV charging, is ownership a reality?” Thacker asked. “We bear the responsibility to solve that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/MFVtWDRXacA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ian Bogost</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/AP_18212620286257/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Rogelio V.

But deepfakes might be different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There is a question of whether deepfakes are actually just a completely different category of thing from normal false statements overall,” he told the Harvard legal scholar Cass Sunstein at the Aspen Ideas Festival, co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, “and I think there is a very good case that they are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Deepfakes have inspired much consternation over their potential to destabilize public discourse. Using new computing techniques, deepfakes can create quite realistic and convincing video and audio of people saying and doing things that they have not. A group of artists, for example, created one of Mark Zuckerberg himself trashing his company. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbedWhzx1rs"&gt;decided to leave it up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Zuckerberg today, however, said that Facebook is working through its “policy process” to figure out what to do about deepfakes. He offered that the problem, from his perspective, was that any definition had to be precisely scoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Is it AI-manipulated media or manipulated media using AI that makes someone say something they didn’t say?” Zuckerberg asked. “I think that’s probably a pretty reasonable definition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is also a noticeably narrow definition. For example, Facebook recently came under fire for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/24/facebook-leaves-fake-nancy-pelosi-video-on-site"&gt;its decision to leave up&lt;/a&gt; a Nancy Pelosi video that had been slowed down to make her appear drug-impaired or otherwise cognitively unsound. It didn’t use AI at all, but merely traditional (and quite basic) editing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the Pelosi controversy was clearly in the background, Zuckerberg’s stated rationale for his definition was to prevent an explosion of takedowns that could result from too broad a definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“If [our &lt;em&gt;deepfake&lt;/em&gt; definition] is any video that is cut in a way that someone thinks is misleading, well, I know a lot of people who have done TV interviews that have been cut in ways they didn’t like, that they thought changed the definition or meaning of what they were trying to say,” he said. “I think you want to make sure you are scoping this carefully enough that you’re not giving people the grounds or precedent to argue that things that they don’t like, or changed the meaning somewhat of what they said in an interview, get taken down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Which, if you consider the number of times that someone claims to have been misquoted or misrepresented by a journalist, is probably a legitimate fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sunstein pushed for a broader definition of what kind of video Facebook should not allow and explicitly referenced the Pelosi video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg described the problem with Facebook’s response as primarily one of “execution.” He said it took the company’s systems “more than a day” to flag the video as potentially misleading. Outside fact-checkers confirmed that in an hour, but over that day, it achieved large-scale distribution. Zuckerberg’s preferred vision would have been for the video to have stayed up but have been flagged immediately, thereby greatly limiting its distribution. “What we want to be doing is improving execution,” Zuckerberg said, “but I do not think we want to go so far toward saying a private company prevented you from saying something that it thinks is factually incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That was in line with Zuckerberg’s other comments this afternoon, in which he repeatedly called for regulation to settle “fundamental trade-offs in values that I don’t think people want private companies to be making by themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Until the time that regulation comes, however, Zuckerberg said his company is working toward creating the best systems of governance it can. And he noted that Facebook is spending more money on content review and safety than the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/a-look-back-in-ipo-facebooks-trailing-profit-and-mobile-intrigue/"&gt;company’s revenue when it IPO’d&lt;/a&gt;. That suggests a spending rate of roughly a billion dollars a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And it was this spending, and the new (clearly still imperfect) infrastructure that it has created, that Zuckerberg used to defend his company from the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html"&gt;renewed calls to break up Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. “On election integrity or content systems, we have an ability because we’re a successful company and large to be able to go build these systems that are unprecedented,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Not all problems seem to be solvable by scale, however. Earlier in the interview, when asked about foreign intervention in America’s elections, Zuckerberg reeled off a list of new Facebook policies, but then ultimately punted. “That’s above my pay grade,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/rCUIWx4c5nM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Alexis C.

By March, all 385 of the 737 Max planes that Boeing had ever delivered to customers had been grounded globally, along with more than 40 planes that the company had built since the accidents. The whole affair was made worse by a series of apparent mistakes and suppressed details within Boeing, arising from the plane’s unusual design. It hinged on a software system that compensated for aerodynamic changes in the basic, decades-old 737 design so that the aircraft could use larger, more efficient engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boeing has endured a lot of justified criticism for its role in the crashes. It’s also received a lot of unsolicited advice. Perhaps most famously, President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1117736685721223168"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in April, “What do I know about branding, maybe nothing (but I did become President!), but if I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, &amp;amp; REBRAND the plane with a new name.” That advice &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-15/trump-boeing-737-max-branding-advice-misses-the-point"&gt;might or might not be good&lt;/a&gt; for Boeing, but as recently as last week there was speculation that the company might be open to renaming the plane. Both &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/business/boeing-737-name-change/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/5608409/boeing-737-max-rename/"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that Boeing’s CFO, Greg Smith, had said the company was “open-minded” about the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speaking this morning at the Aspen Ideas Festival, co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, said he has no plans to rebrand the aircraft. “I don’t see a need to change the name of the airplane,” Muilenburg said. “We’re not focused on branding and marketing. We’re focused on safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief executive insisted that the company both regrets its role in the crashes and chastened itself in their aftermath. “We will always, always be sorry for the lives that have been lost,” Muilenburg said, repeating that the company has made a new commitment to humility as a result. “We’re devastated, and humbled,” he said, adding that the company is “very confident” that the software updates it is currently testing will make the aircraft “one of the safest airplanes to fly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Boeing renames the plane, the 737 Max will enter a dubious club of aircraft known best for their disasters. That includes the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, which was involved in 55 accidents, 32 of which were hull losses, that resulted in more than 1,200 fatalities. Most of the DC-10’s crashes resulted from the design of its cargo doors, which opened in a way that made decompression more likely in flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air travel is still safer than any other means of transportation, but the public’s fears about it, along with the wide and harrowing publicity that results from even a single crash, can doom a plane’s reputation forever. Eventually, McDonnell Douglas replaced the DC-10 with a successor, the MD-11, a name change that was significant enough to distance the equipment from its history. But the 737 is the &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/the-most-popular-plane-ever-made/"&gt;most successful commercial plane of all time&lt;/a&gt;, and Boeing is unlikely to abandon the designation. It’s a grave irony, at the very least, that the plane’s fate would be tied to the term &lt;em&gt;max&lt;/em&gt;—a word that suggests height and greatness. No matter what it’s called, the 737 Max will never be remembered as the apogee of Boeing’s commercial-aviation success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/K_Q0pROUfI0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ian Bogost</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/1/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Boeing</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Boeing Won’t Rename the 737 Max</title><published>2019-06-26T12:59:04-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-26T13:59:25-04:00</updated><summary type="html">“We’re not focused on branding and marketing.

According to someone familiar with the situation, during a “cursory review” of transactions on Wednesday, a worker at the home-goods retailer Wayfair noticed that the company had made a $200,000 sale of bedroom furniture to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/migrant-shelters-border-crossing.html"&gt;government contractor&lt;/a&gt; BCFS. As it turned out, the furniture was to be used in a new detention center in Texas, where at least 1,600 migrant teenagers and children will reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.apnews.com/259d11069cbd4a34be9b4e7a187352da"&gt;be detained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers began discussing the sale in person and on the company Slack, and by Friday had drafted a petition to management asking that Wayfair “cease all current and future business with BCFS” and “establish a code of ethics” for sales. Some 500 employees signed it &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3x84z/wayfair-is-profiting-from-immigration-detention-so-im-walking-out"&gt;that afternoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer, Steve Conine, convened a staff meeting that one employee described as both “packed” and “cringeworthy.” During the meeting, of which &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; obtained audio recordings, Conine declared that he was “very much against these detention centers,” but also emphasized the company’s “duty not to be a discriminatory business.” He ultimately rejected workers’ demands. As a result, employees &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wayfairwalkout/status/1143543982963724288"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; their intention to walk off the job this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;confirmed details of the meeting with a second source. Representatives from Wayfair declined to speak on the record today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/642400509%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-xjjFL&amp;amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;amp;show_teaser=true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to Conine explain that fulfilling orders is a legal question, not a moral one:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay" frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/642400509%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-xjjFL&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The business basically exists to be a profit-generating entity, tries to create success for all our employees, tries to create wealth in all our employees so that we can all have an impact on the world,” Conine said during the meeting. “I mean, we’re not a political entity. We’re not trying to take a political side in this.” When asked whether the B2B team, which handles large corporate and government orders, had a code of ethics, Conine responded, “We should think about a code of ethics. And I think that’s something as a company that we should have a conversation around, we should put together. We should put some thought into that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/06/child-detention-centers-immigration-attorney-interview/592540/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: ‘Children were dirty, they were scared, and they were hungry’&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conine’s desire to avoid the fray is understandable, if naive.

That their sheer scale, multiplied by the wide spectrum of beliefs held by their users, makes moderation of any kind so Sisyphean and so subjective a task that the only possible solution is to allow for just about any idea, or any customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as my colleague Alexis Madrigal notes, the notion of the unbiased platform is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/facebook-and-youtubes-platform-excuse-dying/591466/?utm_source=feed"&gt;dying before our eyes&lt;/a&gt;, if it ever really existed: “Some things could not be said. Some types of content were favored by advertisers and companies. The algorithms they use to sort and promote content have biases.” In other words, you simply cannot order this much information without making some judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/facebook-and-youtubes-platform-excuse-dying/591466/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The ‘platform’ excuse is dying&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Wayfair is not Facebook. Facebook makes money by collecting information about users and serving advertisements, which it achieves in part by maximizing user interactions. Wayfair makes money when you buy a couch or a patio umbrella or a throw pillow. Facebook’s service is speech, which is inherently political. Wayfair’s is moderately priced home goods—inherently not. You can understand why the company might be a little caught off guard to suddenly be defending its business decisions using the language of discrimination and the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it, too, was never really neutral, because any $6 billion, publicly traded company is too powerful not to be. Last year, Wayfair &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/29/tripadvisor-drops-laura-ingraham-after-she-attacked-parkland-activist.html"&gt;pulled ads&lt;/a&gt; from Laura Ingraham’s show after the conservative television host insulted the Parkland survivor David Hogg on Twitter. An employee at the meeting also noted that the company “engages in a lot of political behavior already”: Wayfair doesn’t sell pillows printed with hate speech, for example, and employees “edit the language of customer posts or product information to remove sensitive information—words that might upset someone or be considered sensitive.” None of these examples are exactly the same as refusing service to a government contractor, but the speaker’s ultimate point stands: “Everything that we do … will define our political values as a company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/642400833%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-Z1Q5x&amp;amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;amp;show_teaser=true"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to a Wayfair employee argue that the company has never been politically neutral:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay" frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/642400833%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-Z1Q5x&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a lesson that the large tech platforms have learned, in no small part because their employees have begun to hold them accountable. In the past year, workers at &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/technology/microsoft-ice-immigration.html?module=inline"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/25/17504154/salesforce-employee-letter-border-protection-ice-immigration-cbp"&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/thousands-of-google-employees-protest-companys-involvem-1824988565"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/06/22/amazon-employees-demand-company-cut-ties-with-ice/"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have all pressured their employers to revisit government contracts they deemed unethical. Now, it seems, less overtly political companies are also learning that every decision has political valence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are a furniture company,” one employee told me. “But we also employ people who care about where they work and have every right to surface things when they have problems.” (The employee requested and was granted anonymity for fear of retaliation, and because they didn’t want to take credit for a group effort. On the meeting audio, Kate Gulliver, Wayfair’s head of talent, is heard strongly emphasizing that no employees who walk out will face repercussions. Gulliver did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sell furniture, and so, you know this type of particular, very polarizing example?” Conine said at one point during the meeting. “It doesn’t come up that often.” But really, it was only a matter of time. The political moment has created a sort of moral gyre from which no corporation is truly safe, no matter whether it’s selling dish sets or drones, and no matter how deeply its executives want to avoid taking a side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~4/HWNONcOfn4w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ellen Cushing</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ellen-cushing/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/AP_18107749929776/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jenny Kane / Associated Press</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Wayfair Should Have Seen This Coming</title><published>2019-06-26T12:14:59-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-26T17:32:46-04:00</updated><summary type="html">In leaked audio, the home-goods retailer’s co-founder seemed surprised that his company was being forced to take a political stance.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticScienceAndTechnology/~3/HWNONcOfn4w/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/wayfair-walkout-and-corporate-responsibility/592597/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry></feed>
