				<description><![CDATA[Few photographers can boast the level of commitment that creative photographer and paper artist Catherine MacBride has demonstrated in her twelve years as a Flickr member. Ever since the day she started her first 365 project in 2011, she has been posting images non-stop to her Flickr account. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing, not even Flickr’s <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/2019/05/08/planned-maintenance-and-flickr-downtime/">recent scheduled downtime</a> (when Catherine <a href="https://twitter.com/CatMacBride/status/1131686225381871616">tweeted at us</a> for help to post her 365 shot), has stopped this Irish-born visual storyteller from doing what she loves to do the most: taking photos and sharing them to Flickr. “I think I&#8217;m just stubborn. My husband, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/scottmacbride/">Scott</a>, started this photo-a-day challenge with me back in 2011, and since then I think we&#8217;ve been playing an extremely long game of chicken, both unwilling to give up and let the other win.” </p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/catmacbride/47422759661/" title="song of the sea... by CatMacBride, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7808/47422759661_c24d7dcd60_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="song of the sea..."></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>The idea of finding new and exciting things to photograph every day is simply a chimera. Catherine admits some days are hard, and life gets in the way, but that’s also part of the appeal of doing a continuous 365 days. “I&#8217;ve learnt that my creativity seems to come and go in cycles. I seem to have times when I can knock it out of the park on a daily basis and be so happy with the images I create and times when I feel like I&#8217;m never going to come up with another decent idea. Either way, I still turn up to take the shot and post it to Flickr.” </p>
<p>No matter what comes up, Catherine stays consistent through the good and bad and treats every shot as a learning opportunity for growth. “I&#8217;ve learnt that if I can&#8217;t get something to work as I planned, it&#8217;s not a complete loss. Knowing what doesn&#8217;t work is very useful next time you go to take a shot. I&#8217;ve learnt how to think on my feet. When an idea doesn&#8217;t work out, I can&#8217;t just throw in the towel — I still have to get a shot by midnight.” </p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/catmacbride/36971249173/" title="this is home... by CatMacBride, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4473/36971249173_27579e9ddf_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="this is home..."></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>At this point, she says, Flickr has become an extensive catalogue of her photographic career. “I showcase my images on 500px, Instagram, and Pinterest, and they are my curated portfolio: me on a good day with my hair just done. My Flickr account is my workshop, my photography catalogue, and my visual diary. The place I turn up to in my pyjamas to work through ideas, and it is still after all these years the first site I open when I come online.”</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/catmacbride/45980634574/" title="Nebulous by CatMacBride, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7854/45980634574_f53751308a_b.jpg" width="1000" height="667" alt="Nebulous"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>A project of this magnitude takes time and effort. Planning. Shooting. Processing. The more elaborate paper scenes may take a few days to plan and make, but Catherine is prepared for all the pressures of time constraints: “I started sketching out ideas for shots into a little storyboard notebook whenever an idea came to me from early on in my photo a day project. Having a record can be handy, as they act as triggers on days when you are short of ideas and can also act as a springboard for even more. I often find that shooting a particular image can give me an idea of how it could be turned into a mini-series of images, so that makes shooting continuously easier.”</p>
<p>Besides being a full-time photographer that works for international companies and design agencies, Catherine is a very talented paper artist, a major advantage for a profession where creativity and imagination are the keywords. Running short of ideas becomes less of a problem when you can make things to photograph out of paper: houses, buildings, clouds, all have a place in her own self-constructed, little world. </p>

</div>
<p>“When I look through my Flickr photostream, I can actually see their evolution over time, starting with crude, simple models with simple lighting to more elaborate scenes and lighting setups. They have improved quite drastically over the years, and I even managed to gain my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/catmacbride/36521326294/in/album-72157685586519586/">Fellowship in Photography from the Irish Photographic Federation</a> with a panel of paper images.” </p>

</div>
<p>When asked what is next in her creative career, Catherine says, “I&#8217;m teaching myself the basics of video capture and editing. It just seemed like a natural progression for my photography. I recently managed to get my first hundred videos up on sale with my lovely agency, <a href="https://www.stocksy.com/CatMacBride/video">Stocksy United</a>, which I have to say I&#8217;m rather pleased with. It was a fairly steep learning curve, but I&#8217;ve really enjoyed it. I think pushing myself to learn new things and try different techniques, like video, keeps me creating, and that keeps me happy.”</p>

<p>During the next two weeks, Flickr will be running a contest in collaboration with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/minimally_less_is_more/">“Less is More,”</a> a Flickr group dedicated to minimalist photographs.</p>
<p><strong>The theme for the Contest is (what else?) “Minimalism,”</strong><br />
Starting June 24, 2019 we invite you to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/minimally_less_is_more/discuss/72157709234260732/">submit your photos</a> to our “Less is More” challenge, and also to vote for your favorite images from fellow community members. Three (3) final winners based on your votes will receive some branded Flickr gear.</p>
<p>The contest will remain open for submissions until July 1, 2019 at 4:30PM PT (11:30PM UTC). You can either pick an existing photo from your Photostream or take a new one and share it to the group. Voting will take place between July 1 (immediately after submissions close) and July 8, 2019. Winners will be officially notified via FlickrMail on July 10, and their photographs will be featured on the Flickr Blog and social media channels.</p>
<h2><strong>How to submit:</strong></h2>
<p>1. Post your photograph in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/minimally_less_is_more/discuss/72157709234260732/">this thread</a> by copying and pasting the HTML embed code for the medium 640 size. Posting instructions are <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/minimally_less_is_more/discuss/72157704453940482/">here</a>.<br />

4. You may pick any photo (that you took!) from your stream or take a new one during the week. Photos must be able to qualify as “minimal.”</p>
<h2><strong>How to vote for your favorites:</strong></h2>

2. All entrants must vote, but must not vote for their own submissions.<br />
3. <strong>All members of the group are encouraged to vote</strong>, even if they did not submit a photo to the contest.<br />
4. Up to 3 photos may be voted for by each member, with 3, 2 or 1 point(s) allocated as specified.<br />
5. Please vote in this thread only. Your vote should look something like this, whereby the 1st number is the photo number, and the 2nd number is the number of points you are giving it:<br />
#5 &#8211; 3 points<br />
#8 &#8211; 2 points<br />
#9 &#8211; 1 points</p>

<p>Flickr is so proud to be a new sponsor to the Kennel Club UK’s “Dog Photographer of the Year” competition, a contest that highlights and celebrates dogs for all the reasons we love them. We were lucky enough to speak with Heidi Hudson, who is in charge of the incredible photos entered from all around the world.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Dog Photographer of the Year competition come about? When did it start?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hudson:</strong> The Kennel Club Dog Photographer of the Year is the largest and greatest dog photographer competition in the world having debuted in 2005. Dog Photographer of the Year promotes through the art of photography, the positive attributes of sharing a dog in one’s life. We promote the winning images and the winning dog photographers through our world famous canine art gallery at the Kennel Club headquarters in Mayfair, London.</p>

<p><strong>How has the competition grown since its inception?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hudson:</strong> Over the last fourteen years, The Kennel Club’s Dog Photographer of the Year has grown from strength to strength having started as solely a UK based dog photographer competition of less than one hundred entries the first year to now recognized worldwide with annual entries surpassing 10,000 from over 90 different countries.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Kennel Club’s main goal for hosting this competition? What do they want people to take away from it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hudson: </strong>We love ALL dogs – big, small, pedigree, cross breed, seniors, puppies…and what a better way to share our love of dogs than through great photography!<br />
Dog photography is a great way to spend quality time with your dog and can certainly promote good dog training and dog etiquette. We love photographers to be creative taking photos of dogs but more importantly it’s about getting to know man’s best friend really well and spending quality time with our dogs. Of course highlighting the winning images and promoting the visual aspect of how much dogs bring to our lives every day is what we want everyone to take away – dogs are truly amazing.</p>

<p><strong>When/how did you first become involved and what role do you play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hudson: </strong>I became involved in overseeing Dog Photographer of the Year in 2011 when I took over this role from my previous colleague. It is the best thing about my job – overseeing dog photography and helping to promote dog photographers promote their passion for dogs and photography.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite thing about working on Dog Photographer of the Year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hudson: </strong>There are so many things I love about working on Dog Photographer of the Year – of course looking through so many great dog images is a joy every day but the most rewarding for me personally is seeing how much it changed placing in our annual competition changed someone’s life for the positive. It’s not just about taking home a trophy or a rosette but for some photographers it has literally changed their lives by giving someone the courage to go professional or simply improving their mental health after a bad bout of depression.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think dog photography is important and why do you think people gravitate so much towards taking photos of man’s best friend?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hudson: </strong>Dog photography is so universal – everyone loves dogs and can relate to the love and affection we have for man’s best friend. I think dog photography can be so life affirming to not just the photographer but to the viewer who enjoys great dog photography. It’s a privilege to see how much great dog images can bring so much joy to people’s lives.</p>

<p>On May 22, 2019 <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2019/05/08/planned-maintenance-and-flickr-downtime">Flickr will be down for some planned maintenance</a> for a few hours while we move a huge piece of infrastructure out of Yahoo’s datacenters. We know… downtime sucks, but what must be, must be. Just look at the bright side: now that all the good pandas are going to be busy moving cables around, you’ll have a great excuse to step away from your computer, grab a camera and spend some quality time creating something fun.</p>
<p>To make this scheduled maintenance thing a little more entertaining, we’re planning a photo contest to give away a coupon for a free year of Flickr Pro to ten (10) lucky winners!</p>
<h2><strong>Here’s how to enter:</strong></h2>
<p>On May 22, during actual downtime, print and cut out the image that will appear on the homepage at <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">flickr.com,</a> and take your photo of the little panda on an adventure somewhere. If you prefer, you can just work digitally and Photoshop the image into something original. When the site’s back up, upload your photo to Flickr, tag it with <strong>#goodpandacontest</strong> and add it to the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/goodpandacontest/">Good Panda Photo Contest group</a>.</p>
<p>In exchange for your originality, we will select ten (10) lucky winners to receive a coupon for a free year of Flickr Pro membership for you or a friend.</p>
<p>Winners will be notified by FlickrMail on Tuesday, May 28, 2019. We’ll also celebrate our favorite images from the group in a Flickr Blog post!</p>

<h2><strong>May 24, 2019 update:</strong></h2>
<p>The Flickr website is up and stable, and it&#8217;s running faster than ever. As of 10:15pm PDT, we have just released the mobile apps. It can take up to 90 minutes for your app to receive the activation signal, so if you still see the downtime message, please be patient for just a bit longer. You don&#8217;t have to do anything to reactivate the app; just launch it to see when it&#8217;s ready for you.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience! We&#8217;ll be continuing to monitor the site for stability throughout the weekend. Please check this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157691537882093/">Help Forum post</a> for any ongoing updates.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>May 23, 2019 update:</strong></h2>
<p>As of 8:15pm PDT, We&#8217;re back! It&#8217;s been a long process, but we&#8217;re switched over to AWS. Thank you so much for your patience! Please check this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157691537882093/">Help Forum post</a> for ongoing updates.</p>
<hr />
<p>As of 5:45am PDT, our team is still hard at work completing some final steps to bring the site back online &#8212; it&#8217;s taken a little bit longer than we hoped, but we expect to be up and running within the next several hours. Thank you for your patience!</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>It&#8217;s time to move:</strong></h2>
<p>It is an exciting time at Flickr right now as we approach the final stretch of our migration of Flickr’s data and systems. You may remember that one of the biggest steps we promised in revitalizing Flickr was to bring it increased speed and stability. Part of that process was re-engineering our underlying infrastructure and moving it all from Yahoo’s data centers and onto Amazon Web Services (AWS), where SmugMug’s photos have been kept safe and secure for years.</p>
<p>The process involves hundreds of millions of gigabytes of photos and videos (literally billions of photos) and 100+ million accounts. We knew there would be a few bumps in the road, and one of those unfortunate bumps is the need for some planned downtime while we finish the migration. Luckily though, when this step is complete, we’ll be well on our way to a much faster, much more secure, much more stable Flickr.</p>
<h2><strong>The details:</strong></h2>
<p>On May 22, 2019, Flickr will be down for planned maintenance for about 12 hours starting at 5pm PDT (that’s 8pm EDT or 12am GMT on May 23).</p>
<p>Your data, photos, videos, and settings will all be perfectly safe during this downtime. Once we are back online, you’ll have access to each and every item just as it was before. Also, all your photo rights will obviously continue to be protected and respected.</p>
<h2><strong>After the downtime:</strong></h2>
<p>After we come back online, you’ll be able to access your Flickr account, browse the feed, and explore Flickr just as you did before. However, because of the complexity of this migration, we do anticipate a few parts that may take a little bit more time to bring back online.</p>
<p><strong>Camera Roll and push notifications may break.</strong> The website and mobile apps will provide alternative functionality while the Camera Roll is unavailable; things will look a little different, but you will still be able to access all your photos. On the mobile apps, you will be able to see your notifications after opening the app, but may not receive the notification pushed to your device. If you like, you may visit <a href="https://www.flickr.com/account/email">this link</a> to turn on additional email notifications until push notification service is restored. We’ll be working hard to bring these features back online as fast as possible, but they may remain unavailable for a month or more.</p>
<p><strong>You’ll need to re-download the Android app.</strong> Users who still have the old app will be able to continue to use it for now, but we’ll be discontinuing support and updates to it. We’ll release a new Android app around June 1 that will be available in the Google Play Store and will receive all new product features, updates and bug fixes, and continued support. This is necessary to transfer control over the app out of Yahoo’s developer account and into Flickr’s own account. iOS users get lucky here &#8212; we’re able to transfer that app out of Yahoo without the need for you to re-download.</p>
<hr />
<p>We know this downtime is an inconvenience and we are infinitely grateful to each member of this amazing community for your support and patience as we chip away at this huge undertaking. We’re also thrilled that much of this work is behind us so we can continue putting more and more of our focus on building the features you’ve asked for.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along with the status of the downtime, you can visit our new <a href="https://status.flickr.net/">Flickr Status page</a>. And if you have any questions or concerns, our <a href="https://help.flickr.com/">Support Heroes are available 24/7</a>.</p>
<p>And one last note: To make this scheduled maintenance thing a little more fun, we’re planning a contest to get us all to step away from the computer, grab our cameras, and create. You can check out <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2019/05/08/enter-our-good-panda-photo-contest-for-a-chance-to-win-a-free-year-of-flickr-pro">the details here</a>. We can’t wait to see the view from behind your lens!</p>

</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, even the best photographers make mistakes on occasion; but the ones who improve their skills are those who consistently learn from their failures. If you want to step up your photography game, you should consider asking for feedback from other experienced photographers who can constructively criticize your work. </p>
<p>To facilitate that connection and help you grow your photography skills, we&#8217;re collaborating with the wonderful <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/photographycritique/">Photography Critique</a> group and professional fine-art photographer <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brookeshaden">Brooke Shaden</a>. Brooke will be hosting our critique collaboration from April 26 to May 3, 2019. She’s a visionary conceptual artist known for her breathtaking self-portraits—and she recently celebrated <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/46137351864">TEN years on Flickr</a>!</p>
<h2>The details.</h2>
<p>The theme for this Flickr collaboration is “<strong>Fine Art.</strong>” If you&#8217;d like to have your photos critiqued by Brooke, join the Photography Critique group and post your image <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/photographycritique/discuss/72157706761947511/">in this thread</a>. Then you can create your own, separate discussion with your individual photo for critique. Be sure to carefully read and follow the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/photographycritique/discuss/72157624463037526/">instructions for posting a MEDIUM-sized image into your thread</a>. Images and discussion threads that don&#8217;t follow the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/photographycritique/discuss/72157605856737831/">group guidelines</a> are subject to removal. </p>
<p>Your photo must originate from your Flickr site, and there’s a posting limit of one photo per day, so choose wisely! Please post your images no later than Friday, May 3, 2019, adding the prefix <strong>[Flickr Collab]</strong> in the topic title when you start a new discussion thread. Brooke will be visiting the individual threads to offer critiques and advice during the week. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/photographycritique/">Photography Critique</a> is a wonderful place to engage with other Flickr members. We’re thrilled to celebrate this group and all the amazing photography on Flickr.</p>

<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickrdesign/33696704208/" title="Flickr partners with Pixsy to fight image theft by Flickr Design Team, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7867/33696704208_7f8e5f7554_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Flickr partners with Pixsy to fight image theft"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>We’re excited to announce our new partnership with <a href="https://www.pixsy.com/">Pixsy</a>, an image monitoring and legal tech service that helps photographers find and fight image theft. Pixsy’s reverse image search technology and AI monitors and protects your work 24/7, so you can keep control of where and how your photos are being used around the web. Pixsy also provides you with the tools to tackle any unauthorized use of your images in a variety of different ways.</p>
<p>Here at Flickr, we believe that photographers should be able to decide the type of license and conditions they wish to apply to their work. From helping our members to manage their <a href="https://help.flickr.com/en_us/change-your-photo's-license-in-flickr-B1SxTmjkX">licensing</a>, <a href="https://help.flickr.com/en_us/change-your-privacy-settings-rygl6XoJm">photo privacy</a> and <a href="https://help.flickr.com/en_us/who-can-download-my-photos-in-flickr-HJQxpXiJ7">download</a> settings, we remain aware of the fact that photo theft is a sad reality of the online world and a major issue for photographers trying to make a living off of their work.</p>
<p>Faced with this reality, we&#8217;ve decided to work together with Pixsy, an award-winning online platform for creatives and image owners that lets you discover where and how your images are being used online. Starting today, if you are a Flickr Pro member, you will be able to automatically integrate your Flickr images with Pixsy’s advanced monitoring and protection platform, so you can get notified when new matches of your work are found online, and recover compensation when your images are stolen for commercial gain.</p>
<p>Flickr Pro members get access to 1,000 monitored images, 10 DMCA takedown notices, and unlimited case submission for free. If you are not currently Pro, this is a great opportunity to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro">upgrade</a> and take advantage of the awesome perks that come with a Pro account.</p>

</div>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>To get started, visit your <a href="https://www.flickr.com/account">account settings</a> page on Flickr, locate Pixsy under the “Pro Perks” section, and select “Redeem.” You’ll then be taken to an external page where Pixsy will automatically connect to all your Flickr images. When a copyright infringement is detected by Pixsy, you’ll get access to a variety of tools and services that will help you deal with the unauthorized use of your work. From sending legally binding <a href="https://www.pixsy.com/takedown/">takedown notices</a> to any site globally to have your image removed, to <a href="https://www.pixsy.com/resolve/">submitting a case</a> through Pixsy’s legal department to recover lost revenue on your behalf, you’ll be fully prepared to take action. Pixsy doesn’t get paid unless you do!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In honor of International Women’s Day, we’re featuring the work of one of our most universally beloved Flickr photographers : Brooke Shaden.

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her work is a mix of beautiful, whimsical worlds and dark, thought-provoking images. Learn more about Brooke’s philosophy in our Q&amp;A with her below.</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brookeshaden/46304155952/" title="breached by brookeshaden, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4894/46304155952_1d807ca024_b.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="breached"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How did you get your start in photography? How did you pick fine art self-portraiture photography as opposed to other genres?</strong></p>
<p>My start into photography was a very intuitive venture. I had just graduated from film school with an additional degree in English literature, and my focus was on storytelling. Photography became the next logical step, and I found it an amazing escape from the social aspects of filmmaking. Instead of asking an entire team to help bring my vision to life, I could create by myself entirely and still tell a story &#8211; this time in a single frame. </p>
<p>For me, photography represents freedom. Freedom from social obligation, freedom from collaboration, and freedom to express myself in exactly the way I see fit. I got into this particular style of work because my vision has always been singular. Whether I&#8217;m making a film or writing a story, there is always a focus on darkness and beauty. </p>
<p><strong>What fascinates you about photography? How would you describe your work and photographic style?</strong></p>
<p>Traditional photography promises to depict life as we feel and see it. To take an image that is literally true to life and manipulate that, whether through set design or Photoshop, is like taking control of reality. I love being able to capture what is in front of me and manipulate that scene to reflect the way I see the world. My work is largely informed by that desire to craft the world I wish I lived in. Visually, my style is dark and disturbing yet beautiful, surreal yet grounded in reality. All of my work is square format with an edge toward the cinematic.</p>
<p><strong>How has your style changed from when you started to now?</strong></p>
<p>As a photographer starting out, I wanted to get all of my ideas out fast. I shot every single day for a couple of years, and the concepts I was shooting were very in-your-face, dark, and weird. Over time I learned the difference between shock value versus really meditating on an idea and presenting that idea in the most effective way possible. The main difference between my work then and now is that I&#8217;ve slowed down the production process to create a more meaningful experience for myself and the viewer.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I remember being scared of color and locations. I shot almost everything in my apartment and favored neutral colors. After a hundred images like that, I branched out, and now I love shooting on location outside and utilizing bold colors in my work.</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brookeshaden/31930475957/" title="before I wake by brookeshaden, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4897/31930475957_e746ce0376_b.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="before I wake"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Given everything you’ve learned in your years as a photographer, what do you look for when you “see” a shot? What makes a lasting photograph?</strong></p>
<p>In my case, I don&#8217;t so much &#8220;see&#8221; shots as I create them. I look for timeless, natural backdrops. When I find those spaces, such as fields or forests, I love to put my own concept into that space. For me, the more neutral and unobtrusive a location, the better palette it is for my imagery. Timeless imagery is what I believe makes an image last.</p>
<p><strong>What tip/practical gear/shooting-lighting-or editing technique do you wish you knew about photography when you started, that you now use every time you shoot?</strong></p>
<p>The first is the importance of a great quality image for printing purposes. Of course, for creating in general, this doesn&#8217;t matter at all. But, down the line when you want to print and thus make money as a fine art photographer, those extra pixels and a high dynamic range are important. I&#8217;m a Sony shooter now for that reason. Another practical tip I wish I knew was that I could set my timer to take multiple shots when I&#8217;m doing self-portraits. It has been so helpful during certain shoots to be able to burst capture five images instead of just one!</p>
<p><strong>You recently celebrated your tenth anniversary on Flickr. What’s your favorite part of Flickr? What made you stay with us for so long?</strong></p>
<p>Community. Community all the way. I am an extremely shy, introverted person so I find having &#8220;real life&#8221; friends very challenging. But online, and especially on Flickr, I was able to cultivate a group of like-minded individuals that I could be inspired by and, in turn, inspire, by simply sharing my vision. To find a group of people gathered in one place who appreciates art and are willing to have meaningful conversations about it is priceless. I&#8217;ve met some of my best friends thanks to Flickr. I stay on Flickr because of the promise of friendships, and also to keep an archive of my entire photo journey.</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brookeshaden/31880659888/" title="spirit by brookeshaden, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4858/31880659888_0b4bb9c6a4_b.jpg" width="700" height="700" alt="spirit"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Do you ever find it challenging to work as a female in a male-dominated industry?</strong></p>
<p>I find myself in an interesting position for two reasons. One is that I work entirely alone and remotely, so I don&#8217;t have those in-person experiences where I can see the decision-making process of why I was or was not chosen for a job. But second is that I live my life and career as though my gender is irrelevant, as it is, to me. I love to create any concept, pursue any business decision, no matter what and who is involved.</p>
<p><strong>If you had to give one piece of advice to young and aspiring female photographers today, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>What you have to say is important to someone. You may not know who that person is, or how you will impact them, but rest assured your voice is one that someone needs to hear. Never forget that, and always create with that confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any female photographers you admire, or who may have influenced your work?</strong></p>
