(Intentional usage <em>is</em> what I percieved Walter to have in mind; he just wanted to know which emoji or text strings to use.)</p>\n\n<p>(Sometimes, though, a brief, one-or-two word reply is faster and still gets the message across üòâ)</p>\n",

And because of libraries and not frameworks, you can kind of add things and learn them as you need them. </p>\n\n<p>I think the both of us are bad choices for decding what are inclusive technology and not because we&#39;re both experienced with development. But I can talk about what I have seen from people who are not. And I usually see people struggle with big frameworks like Rails, Django .NET etc where you have to do a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; before you see anyhting visual. </p>\n\n<p>But with things like React / Create React App or Express you can add a line of code and see it on the screen straight away. </p>\n",
