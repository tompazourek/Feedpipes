				<description><![CDATA[It is all but impossible to beat an Aggregator head-on, as Walmart is trying to do with Amazon. The solution instead is to build a platform like Shopify.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I am (rightfully) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexia/status/1146517806357155841">teased</a> about how often I discuss <a href="https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>, there is a method to my madness, particularly over the last year: more and more attention is being paid to the power wielded by Aggregators like Google and Facebook, but to my mind the language is all wrong.</p>
<p>I discussed this at length last year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/techs-two-philosophies/">Tech&#8217;s Two Philosophies</a> highlighted how Facebook and Google want to do things for you; Microsoft and Apple were about helping you do things better.</li>
<li><a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-moat-map/">The Moat Map</a> discussed the relationship between network effects and supplier differentiation: the more that network effects were internalized the more suppliers were commoditized, and the more that network effects were externalized the more suppliers were differentiated.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/">The Bill Gates Line</a> formally defined the difference between Aggregators and Platforms. This is the key paragraph:<br />
<blockquote><p>
  This is ultimately the most important distinction between platforms and Aggregators: platforms are powerful because they facilitate a relationship between 3rd-party suppliers and end users; Aggregators, on the other hand, intermediate and control it.
</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It follows, then, that debates around companies like Google that use the word &#8220;platform&#8221; and, unsurprisingly, draw comparisons to Microsoft twenty years ago, misunderstand what is happening and, inevitably, result in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/">prescriptions that would exacerbate problems that exist</a> instead of solving them.</p>
<p>There is, though, another reason to understand the difference between platforms and Aggregators: platforms are Aggregators&#8217; most effective competition.</p>
<h4>Amazon&#8217;s Bifurcation</h4>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/3/18716431/walmart-jet-marc-lore-modcloth-amazon-ecommerce-losses-online-sales">I wrote about Walmart&#8217;s failure to compete with Amazon head-on</a>; after years of trying to leverage its stores in e-commerce, Walmart realized that Amazon was winning because e-commerce required a fundamentally different value chain than retail stores. The point of my <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/walmarts-e-commerce-struggles-textbook-disruption-the-benefits-of-not-competing/">Daily Update</a> was that the proper response to that recognition was not to try to imitate Amazon, but rather to focus on areas where the stores actually were an advantage, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-value-chain-constraint/">like groceries</a>, but it&#8217;s worth understanding exactly why attacking Amazon head-on was a losing proposition.</p>
<p>When Amazon started, the company followed a traditional retail model, just online. That is, Amazon bought products at wholesale, then sold them to customers:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6.jpeg" alt="Amazon retail sits between suppliers and customers" width="977" height="251" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4279" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6.jpeg 977w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6-300x77.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-6-768x197.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /></a></p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s sales proceeded to grow rapidly, not just of books, but also in other media products with large selections like DVDs and CDs that benefitted from Amazon&#8217;s effectively unlimited shelf-space. This growth allowed Amazon to build out its fulfillment network, and by 1999 the company had seven fulfillment centers across the U.S. and three more in Europe.</p>
<p>Ten may not seem like a lot — Amazon has well over 300 fulfillment centers today, plus many more distribution and sortation centers — but for reference Walmart has only 20. In other words, at least when it came to fulfillment centers, Amazon was halfway to Walmart&#8217;s current scale 20 years ago.</p>
<p>It would ultimately take Amazon another nine years to reach twenty fulfillment centers (this was the time for Walmart to respond), but in the meantime came a critical announcement that changed what those fulfillment centers represented. In 2006 Amazon announced <a href="https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm">Fulfillment by Amazon</a>, wherein 3rd-party merchants could use those fulfillment centers too. Their products would not only be listed on Amazon.com, they would also be held, packaged, and shipped by Amazon.</p>
<p>In short, Amazon.com effectively bifurcated itself into a retail unit and a fulfillment unit:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5.jpeg" alt="Amazon bifurcated itself into retail and fulfillment units" width="1024" height="528" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4278" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5-300x155.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-5-768x396.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The old value chain is still there — nearly half of the products on Amazon.com are still bought by Amazon at wholesale and sold to customers — but 3rd parties can sell directly to consumers as well, bypassing Amazon&#8217;s retail arm and leveraging only Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment arm, which was growing rapidly:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM.png" alt="Amazon Fulfillment Centers Over Time" width="1424" height="790" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4284" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM.png 1424w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-300x166.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-768x426.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-1024x568.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-8.32.49-AM-1136x630.png 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px" /></a></p>
<p>Walmart and its 20 distribution centers don&#8217;t stand a chance, particularly since catching up means competing for consumers not only with Amazon but with all of those 3rd-party merchants filling up all of those fulfillment centers.</p>
<h4>Amazon and Aggregation</h4>
<p>There is one more critical part of the drawing I made above:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4.jpeg" alt="Amazon owns all customer interactions" width="975" height="688" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4280" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4.jpeg 975w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4-300x212.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4-768x542.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-4-893x630.jpeg 893w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the fact that Amazon had effectively split itself in two in order to incorporate 3rd-party merchants, this division is barely noticeable to customers. They still go to Amazon.com, they still use the same shopping cart, they still get the boxes with the smile logo. Basically, Amazon has managed to incorporate 3rd-party merchants while still owning the entire experience from an end-user perspective.</p>
<p>This should sound familiar: as I noted at the top, Aggregators tend to internalize their network effects and commoditize their suppliers, which is exactly what Amazon has done.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/#footnote_0_4277" id="identifier_0_4277" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="While Amazon is not technically an Aggregator &mdash; the company deals with physical goods that absolutely have both marginal and transaction costs &mdash; one way to understand the company&rsquo;s dominance is that its massive investments in logistics have driven those costs much lower than its competitors, allowing the company to reap many of the same benefits.">1</a> Amazon benefits from more 3rd-party merchants being on its platform because it can offer more products to consumers and justify the buildout of that extensive fulfillment network; 3rd-party merchants are mostly reduced to competing on price.</p>
<p>That, though, suggests there is a platform alternative — that is, a company that succeeds by enabling its suppliers to differentiate and externalizing network effects to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem. That alternative is Shopify.</p>
<h4>The Shopify Platform</h4>
<p>At first glance, Shopify isn&#8217;t an Amazon competitor at all: after all, there is nothing to buy on Shopify.com. And yet, there were 218 million people that bought products from Shopify without even knowing the company existed.</p>
<p>The difference is that Shopify is a platform: instead of interfacing with customers directly, 820,000 3rd-party merchants sit on top of Shopify and are responsible for acquiring all of those customers on their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg" alt="Merchants interact with customers, not Shopify" width="990" height="683" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4281" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3.jpeg 990w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3-300x207.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3-768x530.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-3-913x630.jpeg 913w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /></a></p>
<p>This means they have to stand out not in a search result on Amazon.com, or simply offer the lowest price, but rather earn customers&#8217; attention through differentiated product, social media advertising, etc. Many, to be sure, will fail at this: Shopify does not break out merchant churn specifically, but it is almost certainly extremely high.</p>
<p>That, though, is the point.</p>
<p>Unlike Walmart, currently weighing whether to spend additional billions after the billions it has already spent trying to attack Amazon head-on, with a binary outcome of success or failure, Shopify is massively diversified. That is the beauty of being a platform: you succeed (or fail) in the aggregate.</p>
<p>To that end, I would argue that for Shopify a high churn rate is just as much a positive signal as it is a negative one: the easier it is to start an e-commerce business on the platform, the more failures there will be. And, at the same time, the greater likelihood there will be of capturing and supporting successes.</p>
<p>This is how Shopify can both in the long run be the biggest competitor to Amazon even as it is a company that Amazon can&#8217;t compete with: Amazon is pursuing customers and bringing suppliers and merchants onto its platform on its own terms; Shopify is giving merchants an opportunity to differentiate themselves while bearing no risk if they fail.</p>
<h4>The Shopify Fulfillment Network</h4>
<p>This is the context for one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRRwW8fiHUY&amp;list=PLvQF73bM4-5XoGEPnerBbkIef1egtD1x9&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s">the most interesting announcements</a> from Shopify&#8217;s recent partner conference, Shopify Unite. The name should ring familiar: the Shopify <em>Fulfillment</em> Network.</p>
<p>From the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/unite-2019#5">blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Customers want their online purchases fast, with free shipping. It’s now expected, thanks to the recent standard set by the largest companies in the world. Working with third-party logistics companies can be tedious. And finding a partner that won’t obscure your customer data or hide your brand with packaging is a challenge.</p>
<p>  This is why we’re building Shopify Fulfillment Network—a geographically dispersed network of fulfillment centers with smart inventory-allocation technology. We use machine learning to predict the best places to store and ship your products, so they can get to your customers as fast as possible.</p>
<p>  We’ve negotiated low rates with a growing network of warehouse and logistic providers, and then passed on those savings to you. We support multiple channels, custom packaging and branding, and returns and exchanges. And it’s all managed in Shopify.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The first paragraph explains why the Shopify Fulfillment Network was a necessary step for Shopify: Amazon may commoditize suppliers, hiding their brand from website to box, but if its offering is truly superior, suppliers don&#8217;t have much choice. That was increasingly the case with regards to fulfillment, particularly for the small-scale sellers that are important to Shopify not necessarily for short-term revenue generation but for long-run upside. Amazon was simply easier for merchants and more reliable for customers.</p>
<p>Notice, though, that Shopify is not doing everything on their own: there is an entire world of third-party logistics companies (known as &#8220;3PLs&#8221;) that offer warehousing and shipping services. What Shopify is doing is what platforms do best: act as an interface between two modularized pieces of a value chain.</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg" alt="Shopify as interface between 3PLs and merchants" width="985" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4283" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1.jpeg 985w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1-300x158.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-1-768x405.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px" /></a></p>
<p>On one side are all of Shopify&#8217;s hundreds of thousands of merchants: interfacing with all of them on an individual basis is not scalable for those 3PL companies; now, though, they only need to interface with Shopify.</p>
<p>The same benefit applies in the opposite direction: merchants don&#8217;t have the means to negotiate with multiple 3PLs such that their inventory is optimally placed to offer fast and inexpensive delivery to customers; worse, the small-scale sellers I discussed above often can&#8217;t even get an audience with these logistics companies. Now, though, Shopify customers need only interface with Shopify.</p>
<h4>Plaforms Versus Aggregators</h4>
<p>Moreover, this is what Shopify has already accomplished when it comes to referral partners (who drive new merchants onto the platform), developers (who build apps for managing Shopify stores) and theme designers (who sell themes to customize the look-and-feel of stores). COO Harley Finkelstein <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HD4uGlS1SM&amp;list=PLvQF73bM4-5XoGEPnerBbkIef1egtD1x9&amp;index=8">said at Unite</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You&#8217;ve often heard me say that we at Shopify want to create more value for your partners than we capture for ourselves, and I find the best way to demonstrate this is by looking at what I call the &#8220;Partner Economy&#8221;. The &#8220;Partner Economy&#8221; is the amount of revenue that flows to all of you our partners…in 2018 Shopify made about a billion dollars [<em>Editor: in revenue</em>]. We estimate that you, our partners, made more than $1.2 billion.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Shopify clears the <em>Bill Gates Line</em> — it captures a minority of the value in the ecosystem it has created — and the Shopify Fulfillment Network should fit right in:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg" alt="The Shopify platform" width="973" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4282" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2.jpeg 973w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-300x227.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-768x581.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_272058378EFF-2-833x630.jpeg 833w" sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px" /></a></p>
<p>What is powerful about this model is that it leverages the best parts of modularity — diversity and competition at different parts of the value chain — and aligns the incentives of all of them. Every referral partner, developer, theme designer, and now 3PL provider is simultaneously incentivized to compete with each other narrowly <em>and</em> ensure that Shopify succeeds broadly, because that means the pie is bigger for everyone.</p>
<p>This is the only way to take on an integrated Aggregator like Amazon: trying to replicate what Amazon has built up over decades, as Walmart has attempted, is madness. Amazon has the advantage in every part of the stack, from more customers to more suppliers to lower fulfillment costs to faster delivery.</p>
<p>The only way out of that competition is differentiation; granted, Walmart has tried buying and launching new brands exclusive to its store, but differentiation when it comes to e-commerce goods doesn&#8217;t arise from top down planning. Rather, it bubbles up from widespread opportunity (and churn!), like that created by Shopify, supported by an entire aligned ecosystem.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Libra is less about an immediate benefit to Facebook, and more about creating a world where companies like Facebook have the best chance to prosper. That is why Facebook gave up so much control.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I get things wrong — and I was very much wrong about Facebook&#8217;s blockchain plans — the reason is usually a predictable one: confirmation bias. That is, I already have an idea of what a company&#8217;s motivations are, and then view news through that lens, failing to think critically about what parts of that news might actually disconfirm my assumptions.</p>
<p>So it was last month when the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-building-cryptocurrency-based-payments-system-11556837547">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Facebook was building a cryptocurrency-based payment system. I wrote in a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/facebooks-cryptocurrency-the-problem-and-benefit-of-credit-cards-the-facebook-payment-network/">Daily Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Start with the obvious: this isn’t a Bitcoin competitor. And why would it be? The entire point of Bitcoin is to be distributed; Facebook’s power come from its centralization. Indeed, this is probably the single most important prism through which to examine whatever it is that Facebook does in the space: the company is not going betray its dominant position, but rather seek to strengthen it. That is why I am not too concerned about not knowing the implementation details: take it as a given that whatever role users have to play in this network, Facebook will have final control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I stand by the first part of that excerpt: for all of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ambitious-plan-behind-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra/">the positive attributes</a> Facebook is highlighting about Project Libra — which Facebook, in conjunction with the newly formed <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/">Libra Association</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-unveils-crypto-wallet-based-on-currency-libra-11560850141">announced last week</a> — it is unreasonable to expect that Facebook would invest significant resources in something that would weaken its position. What I got wrong was presuming that meant overt Facebook control. Frustratingly, it was an error that should have both been obvious in my original analysis and also clear in the broader view of the Internet I have explained through <a href="https://stratechery.com/concept/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>.</p>
<h4>What is Libra</h4>
<p>Libra is being presented as a cryptocurrency based on a blockchain: transactions are recorded on a shared ledger and verified by &#8220;miners&#8221; independently solving cryptographic problems and arriving at a consensus that the transaction is legitimate and should be added to the ledger permanently.</p>
<p>In practice, it is much more complicated: while a limited set of &#8220;validators&#8221; — aka miners — share a history of transactions in (individual) blocks that are chained together (i.e. a blockchain), what Libra actually exposes is the current state of the ledger. In practice this means that adding new transactions can be much quicker and more efficient — more akin to adding a line to a spreadsheet than rebuilding the entire spreadsheet from scratch.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a trade-off between trust and efficiency: whereas anyone can &#8220;rebuild the spreadsheet&#8221; in the case of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, where the blockchain is fully exposed, normal users have to trust Libra&#8217;s validators.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/#footnote_0_4249" id="identifier_0_4249" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="To clarify, this roadmap on the Libra developers blog includes plans to allow anyone to &ldquo;rebuild the spreadsheet&rdquo;:

  Validator APIs to support full nodes (nodes that have a full replica of the blockchain but do not participate in consensus). This feature allows for the creation of replicas that can support scaling access to the blockchain and the auditing of the correct execution of transactions.

However, only validators can actually validate transactions (unlike Bitcoin where anyone can be a miner/validator) ">1</a> On the other hand, Bitcoin, thanks to the overhead of communicating and verifying every transaction, can only manage around 7 transactions a second; Libra is promising 1,000 transactions per second.</p>
<h4>The Validators</h4>
<p>Who, then, are the validators? Well, Facebook is one, but only one: currently there are 28 &#8220;Founding Members&#8221;, including merchants, venture capitalists, and payment networks, that meet two of the following three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than $1 billion USD in market value or more than $500 million USD in customer cash flow</li>
<li>Reach more than 20 million people a year</li>
<li>Recognition as a top-100 industry leader by a third-party association such as Fortune or S&amp;P</li>
</ul>
<p>These &#8220;Founding Members&#8221; are required to make a minimum investment of $10 million and provide computing power to the network. In addition, there are separate requirements for non-profit organizations and academic institutions that rely on a mixture of budget, track record, and rankings; a minimum investment may not be necessary. Libra intends to have 100 Founding Members by the time it launches next year.</p>
<p>Here is the important thing to understand about the Libra Association: while its members — who again, are the validators — do control the Libra protocol, Facebook does not control the validators. Which, by extension, means that Facebook will not control Libra.</p>
<h4>Libra Versus a Facebook Coin</h4>
<p>To understand the distinction, consider an alternative route that Facebook could have taken: a so-called &#8220;Facebook Coin&#8221;. In that case Facebook would have had total control over the protocol, and to be sure, this would have distinct advantages for Facebook specifically and the usability of a &#8220;Facebook Coin&#8221; generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficiency and scalability would be maximized because Facebook could coordinate perfectly with itself</li>
<li>Development would be significantly accelerated because Facebook would not have to achieve consensus</li>
<li>Facebook would have perfect knowledge of all transactions on the system because it would control all entry points</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the Trust-Efficiency tradeoff taken to the opposite extreme from Bitcoin:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5.jpeg" alt="A theoretical Facebook Coin would be the opposite of Bitcoin" width="1024" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4250" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-5-840x630.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>With Bitcoin, there is no need to trust anyone — you can verify the entire blockchain yourself — but at the cost of efficiency of transactions. A Facebook Coin, on the other hand, would require complete trust of Facebook, but transactions would be far more efficient as a result.</p>
<p>The most obvious example of this is WeChat Pay: WeChat handles the transactions, stores the money, and is the sole source of authority about who owns what, and thanks to the ubiquity of WeChat and the efficiency of this model, WeChat Pay (along with Alipay) has become the default payment mechanism in China.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, WeChat doesn&#8217;t use any sort of blockchain-based technology. Why would it? The entire point of a blockchain is to distribute a ledger across multiple parties, which is fundamentally less efficient than simply storing the entire ledger in a single database managed by one party.</p>
<h4>Trust Versus Efficiency</h4>
<p>This gets at the error in analysis I referenced above: because I was anchored on the idea of Facebook capturing transaction data, I missed that when the Wall Street Journal reported last month that Facebook was using some sort of blockchain technology (leaving aside the quibble on the definition noted above) it was an obvious signal that whatever Facebook was announcing would <em>not</em> be completely controlled by Facebook, because if the goal were Facebook control of a Facebook Coin then a blockchain would be a silly way to implement it.</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3.jpeg" alt="A decentralized blockchain versus a centralized database" width="1024" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4253" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-3-840x630.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The best way to understand Libra, then, is as a sort of distributed ledger that is a compromise between a fully public blockchain and an internal database:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2.jpeg" alt="A distributed ledger as a compromise between a decentralized blockchain and a centralized database" width="1024" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4252" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-2-840x630.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>This means that the overall system is much more efficient than Bitcoin, while the necessary level of trust is spread out to multiple entities, not one single company:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4.jpeg" alt="Bitcoin versus Libra versus a theoretical Facebook coin" width="1024" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4251" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-4-840x630.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The trade-off is that Libra is not fully permissionless, although the <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/">Libra White Paper</a> does say that is the long-term goal:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  To ensure that Libra is truly open and always operates in the best interest of its users, our ambition is for the Libra network to become permissionless. The challenge is that as of today we do not believe that there is a proven solution that can deliver the scale, stability, and security needed to support billions of people and transactions across the globe through a permissionless network. One of the association’s directives will be to work with the community to research and implement this transition, which will begin within five years of the public launch of the Libra Blockchain and ecosystem.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Time will tell if this is possible: if you flip the &#8220;trust&#8221; axis in the above graphs the current state of affairs looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1.jpeg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1.jpeg" alt="Is there an efficiency frontier when it comes to no-trust and efficiency?" width="1024" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4254" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1.jpeg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_A8EB77772EB3-1-840x630.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>It may very well prove to be the case that there is a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier">efficient frontier</a> when it comes to &#8220;no-trust&#8221; versus &#8220;efficiency&#8221;: that is, any decrease in necessary trust requires a corresponding decrease in efficiency. From my perspective the safest assumption about Libra&#8217;s future is that efficiency will be the ultimate priority, which means that the more that Libra is used the more difficult it will be to ever transition to a permission-less model.</p>
<h4>The Credit Card Challenge</h4>
<p>Still, even if Libra remains controlled by an ever-expanding-but-still-limited set of validators, that is likely to be a far easier &#8220;sale&#8221; than a Facebook Coin controlled by a single company. Leaving aside the fact Facebook is not exactly swimming in trust these days when it comes to users, why would any other large company want to adopt a currency with a single point of corporate control?</p>
<p>Keep in mind the situation in the United States and other developed countries is much different than China: credit cards have their flaws, particularly in terms of fees, but they are widely accepted by merchants and widely used by consumers. China, on the other hand, mostly leapfrogged credit cards entirely; this meant that WeChat Pay&#8217;s (and Alipay&#8217;s) competition was cash: in that case the relative advantages of WeChat Pay relative to cash (which are massive) could overcome any concerns around centralized control.</p>
<p>A theoretical Facebook Coin&#8217;s relative advantage to credit cards, on the other hand, would be massively smaller, which means obstacles to widespread adoption — like trusting Facebook exclusively — would likely be insurmountable:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167.jpg"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167.jpg" alt="How new payment systems are — or are not — adopted" width="2309" height="1466" class="size-full wp-image-4179" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167.jpg 2309w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-300x190.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-768x488.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_0167-992x630.jpg 992w" sizes="(max-width: 2309px) 100vw, 2309px" /></a></p>
<p>Thus the federation of trust inherent in Libra, despite the loss of efficiency that entails: by <em>not</em> being in control, and by actively including corporations like Spotify and Uber that will provide places to use Libra outside of Facebook, and payment networks like Visa and PayPal that will facilitate such usage, Facebook is increasing the chances that Libra will actually be used instead of credit cards.</p>
<h4>Aggregation and the Long Game</h4>
<p>I do think it is overly cynical to completely dismiss the advertised benefits of Libra: remittances, for example, have been the go-to example of how cryptocurrencies can have societal benefit for a long time for a very good reason — the current system exacts major fees from the population that can least afford to bear them. And, while I just spent an entire section on credit cards, the reality is that credit card penetration is much lower amongst the poor in developed countries and in developing countries generally: a digital currency ultimately premised on owning a smartphone has the potential to significantly expand markets to the benefits of both consumers and service providers.</p>
<p>To put it another way, Libra has the potential to significantly decrease friction when it comes to the movement of money; of course this potential is hardly limited to Libra — the reduction in friction is one of the selling points of digital currencies generally — but by virtue of being supported by Facebook, particularly the <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/06/coming-in-2020-calibra/">Calibra wallet</a> that will be both a standalone app and also built into Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, accessing Libra will likely be much simpler than accessing other cryptocurrencies. When it comes to decreasing friction, simplifying the user experience matters just as much as eliminating intermediary institutions.</p>
<p>There is also another component of trust beyond caring about who is verifying transactions: confidence that the value of Libra will be stable. This is the reason why Libra will have a fully-funded reserve denominated in a basket of currencies. This does not foreclose Libra becoming a fully standalone currency in the long run, but for now both users and merchants will be able to trust that the value of Libra will be sufficiently stable to use it for transactions.</p>
<p>If all of these bets pay off — that users and merchants will trust a consortium more than Facebook; that Libra will be cheaper and easier to use, more accessible, and more flexible than credit cards; and that Libra itself will be a reliable store of value — then that decrease in friction will be realized at scale.</p>
<p>And this is when this bet would pay off for Facebook (and the second point I missed in my earlier analysis): the implication that digital currencies will do for money what the Internet did for information is that the very long-term trend will be towards centralization around Aggregators. When there is no friction, control shifts <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/goodbye-gatekeepers/">from gatekeepers</a> controlling supply to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregators controlling demand</a>. To that end, by pioneering Libra, building what will almost certainly be the first wallet for the currency, and bringing to bear its unmatched network for facilitating payments, Facebook is betting it will offer the best experience for digital currency flows, giving it power not by controlling Libra but rather by controlling the most users of Libra.</p>
<h4>Will It Work?</h4>
<p>Libra&#8217;s success, if it comes, will likely proceed in stages, with different challenges and competitors at each stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially the most obvious use case for Facebook&#8217;s Calibra wallet application will be peer-to-peer payments, which means the competitor will be applications like PayPal&#8217;s Venmo. Here Facebook&#8217;s biggest advantage will be leveraging its network and messaging applications.</li>
<li>The second use case will be using Libra to transact with merchants, who stand to benefit both from reduced fees relative to credit cards as well as larger addressable markets (i.e. potential users who don&#8217;t have credit cards). Note that none of Libra&#8217;s Founding Members are banks, which impose the largest percentage of credit card fees; Visa and Mastercard, on the other hand, are, like PayPal, happy to sit on top of Libra.</li>
<li>The largest leap will come last: Libra as a genuine currency, not simply a medium for transaction. This will be a function of volume in the previous two use cases, and is understandably concerning to governments all over the world. This, though, is another advantage of Facebook giving up direct control of Libra: while regulators will be able to limit wallets like Calibra (which will fully abide by Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering regulations), Libra — particularly if it achieves a fully permission-less-model — would be much more difficult to control.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to see how Facebook, given its size, would thrive in that final state, for the reasons I detailed above. Just as <a href="https://twitter.com/asymco/status/417647326665400321/photo/1">Google long boasted</a> that the more people use the Internet the more revenue Google generates, it stands to reason that the more people use digital money the more it would benefit dominant digital companies like Facebook, whether that be through advertising, transactions, or simply making networks that much more valuable.</p>
<p>That, though, is also a reason to be skeptical: the idea of Google making more money by people using the Internet more was once viewed as a happy alignment of incentives that justified Google&#8217;s services being free; today the centralization — and thus money-making potential — that follows a reduction in friction is much better understood, and there is much more concern about just how much power these Aggregators have.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case with Facebook: despite all of the company&#8217;s efforts to design a system that does <em>not</em> entail trusting Facebook exclusively — again, this is not a Facebook Coin — Libra is already widely known as a Facebook initiative. Unless the consumer benefits are truly extraordinary, that may be enough to prevent Libra from ever gaining escape velocity. This applies even more to the Calibra wallet: Facebook promises not to mix transaction data with profile data, but that entails, well, trust that Facebook may have already lost.</p>
<p>Still, that doesn&#8217;t mean digital currencies will never make it: I do think that Libra gets closer to a workable balance between trust and efficiency than Bitcoin, at least when it comes to being usable for transactions and not simply a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/tulips-myths-and-cryptocurrencies/">store of value</a>; the question is who can actually get such a currency off the ground. Certainly Facebook&#8217;s audacity and ambition should not be underestimated, and the company&#8217;s network is the biggest reason to believe Libra will work; <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/">Facebook&#8217;s brand</a> is the biggest reason to believe it will not.</p>
<ol class="footnotes"><li id="footnote_0_4249" class="footnote">To clarify, <a href="https://developers.libra.org/blog/2019/06/18/the-path-forward">this roadmap on the Libra developers blog</a> includes plans to allow anyone to &#8220;rebuild the spreadsheet&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Validator APIs to support full nodes (nodes that have a full replica of the blockchain but do not participate in consensus). This feature allows for the creation of replicas that can support scaling access to the blockchain and the auditing of the correct execution of transactions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>However, only validators can actually validate transactions (unlike Bitcoin where anyone can be a miner/validator) </li></ol>]]></content:encoded>

				<description><![CDATA[A review of the potential antitrust cases against Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon suggests that only Google is vulnerable.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago I wrote <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregation Theory</a>, which argued that technology companies, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-problem-with-aggregation-theory-demand-at-scale-supplier-power-and-value/">uniquely enabled by zero marginal costs</a>, were dominant by virtue of user preference driving suppliers onto their platforms, creating a virtuous cycle. Then, one month later, I predicted that the end state of Aggregation Theory would be increased demands for antitrust action. From <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-and-regulation/">Aggregation and the New Regulation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This last point is key: under Aggregation Theory the winning aggregators have strong winner-take-all characteristics. In other words, they tend towards monopolies. Google is perhaps the best Aggregation Theory example of all — the company modularized individual pages from the publications that housed them even as it became the gateway to said pages for the vast majority of people — and so, given their success, perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise that the company is under formal investigation by the European Union.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a second more subtle point in that article, though:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In other words, the regulation situation for these massive winner-take-all companies is not hopeless, but it has changed: their strength derives from the customer relationships they own, which means quiet backroom deals and straight-up arm wrestling of the Google and Uber varieties are liable to backfire in the face of overwhelming public opinion; it is in shaping that public opinion that the real battle will be fought. And while it’s true that the direct relationship aggregation companies have with their users is an advantage in this fight, the overwhelming power of social media is the new counterweight: it is easier than ever to reach said users with a report or column that resonates deeply. Your average writer or reporter has more (potential) power, not less.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems like the best explanation for how we have arrived at the current moment; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-justice-dept-considering-apple-probe-sources-idUSKCN1T42DD">Reuters reported last week</a> that the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission were divvying up tech companies for potential antitrust investigations — Google and Apple to the former, and Facebook and Amazon to the latter — a seemingly natural endpoint to what has been a mounting drumbeat for regulatory action against tech.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one problem: it&#8217;s not clear what there is to investigate.</p>
<hr />
<p>I should state an obligatory caveat: I am not a lawyer or economist, which is relevant given that U.S. antitrust cases are adjudicated in court and largely driven by expert testimony. That reality, though, only underscores the point: any case against these four companies (with possibly one exception, which I will get to momentarily), will be extremely difficult to win.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/#footnote_0_4241" id="identifier_0_4241" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="I will mention the European Commission&rsquo;s different standards in passing; I addressed the differences between U.S. and European approaches more fully in 2016&rsquo;s Antitrust and Aggregation ">1</a> To explain why, it is worth examining all four companies with regards to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether or not they have a durable monopoly</li>
<li>What anticompetitive behavior they are engaging in</li>
<li>What remedies are available</li>
<li>What will happen in the future with and without regulator intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for comparison&#8217;s sake, I will evaluate late 1990&#8217;s Microsoft, the last major tech antitrust case in the United States, along the same dimensions.</p>
<h4>Durable Monopolies</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/single-firm-conduct/monopolization-defined">FTC defines monopolization</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Courts do not require a literal monopoly before applying rules for single firm conduct; that term is used as shorthand for a firm with significant and durable market power — that is, the long term ability to raise price or exclude competitors. That is how that term is used here: a &#8220;monopolist&#8221; is a firm with significant and durable market power. Courts look at the firm&#8217;s market share, but typically do not find monopoly power if the firm (or a group of firms acting in concert) has less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service within a certain geographic area. Some courts have required much higher percentages. In addition, that leading position must be sustainable over time: if competitive forces or the entry of new firms could discipline the conduct of the leading firm, courts are unlikely to find that the firm has lasting market power.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are (at least) two major questions that arise from this: how is the relevant market defined, and what does it mean for market power to be sustainable over time?</p>
<p><strong>1990s Microsoft:</strong> Microsoft was found to have a monopoly on operating systems for personal computers, and that advantage was found to be durable because of the lock-in created by the network effects between developers using the Windows API and users. Both conclusions were reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong> Google certainly has a dominant position in search, but the real question is around durability. Google has long argued that &#8220;Competition is only a click away&#8221;, which has the welcome benefit of being true.</p>
<p>The European Commission <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-1785_en.htm">handled this objection</a> by arguing that Google also enjoys network effects:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There are also high barriers to entry in these markets, in part because of network effects: the more consumers use a search engine, the more attractive it becomes to advertisers. The profits generated can then be used to attract even more consumers. Similarly, the data a search engine gathers about consumers can in turn be used to improve results.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is certainly a much more tenuous lock-in than the Windows API, but I think it is a plausible one.</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong> There is no company for which the question of market definition matters more than Apple. The company is eager to point out that the iPhone has a minority smartphone share in every market in which it competes; even in the U.S., Apple&#8217;s best market, the iPhone has 45% share, less than the 50 percent of sales the FTC suggests as a cut-off.</p>
<p>In Europe, Apple is likely in trouble when it comes to the European Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://accounts.ft.com/login?location=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F1cc16026-6da7-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d">investigation of Apple</a> about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/spotify-files-antitrust-complaint-against-apple-spotify-and-warren-more-amazon-marketplace-changes/">Spotify&#8217;s complaints about the App Store</a>. In the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-commission-versus-android/">Google Android case</a> the European Commission determined that &#8220;Google is dominant in the markets for general internet search services, licensable smart mobile operating systems and app stores for the Android mobile operating system.&#8221; That last clause leaves room for Apple to be found dominant in app store for the iOS mobile operating system, at which point taking 30% of Spotify&#8217;s revenue (or else forbidding Spotify to even link to a web page with a sign-up form) will almost certainly be ruled illegal.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect the Department of Justice will have a much more difficult time convincing a federal court that such a narrow definition is appropriate, but at the same time, I&#8217;m not certain that &#8220;smartphones&#8221; are the correct market definition either. Suggesting that users changing ecosystems is a sufficient antidote to Apple&#8217;s behavior is like suggesting that users subject to a hospital monopoly in their city should simply move elsewhere; asking a third party to remedy anticompetitive behavior by incurring massive inconvenience with zero immediate gain is just as problematic as making up market definitions to achieve a desired result.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Here again market definitions are very fuzzy. Most people have multiple social media accounts across both Facebook and non-Facebook services, which means any sort of workable market share definition would have to rely on &#8220;time-spent&#8221; or some other zero-sum metric. Moreover, it&#8217;s not clear what is or is not a social network: does iMessage count? What about text messaging generally? What about email?</p>
<p>There certainly is an argument that Google and Facebook are a duopoly when it comes to digital advertising, but it is not as if either has the power to foreclose supply: there is effectively infinite advertising inventory on the Internet, which suggests that Google and Facebook earn more advertising dollars because they are better at advertising, not because they foreclose competition.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> There really is no plausible argument that Amazon has a monopoly. Yes, the company has around 37% of e-commerce sales, but (1) that is obviously less than 50% and (2) the competition is only a click away! Moreover, it&#8217;s not clear why &#8220;e-commerce&#8221; is the relevant market, and in terms of retail Amazon has low single-digits market share.</p>
<h4>Anticompetitive Behavior</h4>
<p>But for a few exceptions, everything that follows is moot if the company in question is not found to have a durable monopoly. After all, &#8220;anticompetitive behavior&#8221; is simply another name for &#8220;driving differentiation&#8221;, which no one should want to be illegal for any company that is not in a dominant position; it is the potential to make outsized profits that drives innovation.</p>
<p>Still, it is worth examining what, if anything, these companies do that might be considered problematic.</p>
<p><strong>1990s Microsoft:</strong> Microsoft was found guilty of illegally bundling Internet Explorer with Windows and unfairly restricting OEMs from shipping computers with alternative browsers (or alternative operating systems). The first objection is particularly interesting in 2019, given that it is unimaginable that any operating system would ship without web browser functionality (which, at a minimum, would obviate an essential distribution channel for 3rd-party software). The second is much more problematic: as I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/where-warrens-wrong/">Where Warren&#8217;s Wrong</a>, competition-constraining contracts from dominant players should be viewed with extreme skepticism, as their purpose is almost always to extend dominance, not increase consumer welfare.</p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong> Again — and note a developing theme here — Google&#8217;s anticompetitive behavior is relatively clear. First, the company consistently favors its own properties in search results, particularly &#8220;above-the-fold&#8221; — that is, results that are not actually search results but which seek to answer the user&#8217;s query directly. A partial list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google by-and-large removed video segments from competing properties in favor of YouTube videos</li>
<li>Google offers local results from Google Maps above search results that tend to favor Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.</li>
<li>Google offers hotel and flight listings above search results that tend to favor Booking, Expedia, etc.</li>
<li>Google displays AMP-enabled websites (a Google technology) above search results that are agnostic about how a web page is displayed.</li>
<li>Google displays tweets for individuals (thanks to a beneficial relationship with Twitter) above search results that tend to favor LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these local is probably the most open-and-shut case (although Google&#8217;s efforts around travel and hospitality are on the same track): Google Maps results were worse, got better when Google scraped data from competitors (which it stopped doing after an FTC investigation), and now is somewhat competitive by sheer force of exposure to customers defaulting to Google search.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there is Android, where Google leveraged the Play Store to force Android OEMs to feature Search and Chrome, and further forbade said OEMs from shipping any phones with open-source Android alternatives (a la Microsoft). <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-commission-versus-android/">This is one case the European Commission got exactly right</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong> As I argued in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/">Antitrust, the App Store, and Apple</a>, Apple is leveraging its position in the smartphone market to earn rents in the market for digital goods:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  To put it another way, Apple profits handsomely from having a monopoly on iOS: if you want the Apple software experience, you have no choice but to buy Apple hardware. That is perfectly legitimate. The company, though, is leveraging that monopoly into an adjacent market — the digital content market — and rent-seeking. Apple does nothing to increase the value of Netflix shows or Spotify music or Amazon books or any number of digital services from any number of app providers; they simply skim off 30% because they can.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For this to be illegal does not necessarily require that Apple have a monopoly: tying (i.e. iOS users must use the App Store) is <em>per se</em> illegal in theory, but in practice the Supreme Court has dramatically constricted the definition of tying to include a requirement that the tie-er have market dominance; the Supreme Court also declined to review the Court of Appeals decision in the <em>Microsoft</em> case, which held that courts should use a rule of reason test for software specifically that also considers the benefits of tying, not simply the downsides.</p>
<p>I would certainly argue that the requirement that digital content use Apple&#8217;s payment processor (and thus give up 30%) has downsides that outweigh the benefits, but the truth is that this is a case that, under U.S. antitrust law, is harder to make than it was 20 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> There are certainly plenty of reasons to be upset with Facebook when it comes to issues of privacy, but the company has not done anything illegal from an antitrust perspective.</p>
<p>I am, to be clear, distinguishing anti-competitive behavior from anti-competitive mergers. I have made the case as to why <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-buy-tbh/">Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Instagram was so problematic</a>, and this is the area that needs the most urgent attention from anyone who cares about competition. The single best way to maintain a dominant position in a market as dynamic as technology is to use the outsized profits that come from winning in one market to buy the winner in another; it follows, then, that the best way to spur competition in the long run is to force companies to compete with new entrants, not buy them out.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> Make no mistake, Amazon drives a very hard bargain with its suppliers. Those suppliers, though, have a whole host of alternatives through which to sell their product. Meanwhile, those hard bargains accrue to consumers&#8217; benefit.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is very hard to see why Amazon can&#8217;t offer its own branded goods; this practice is widespread in retail, and for good reason: consumers get a better price, not only on the store-branded goods, but also on 3rd-party goods that can be priced more competitively since the retailer is making its margin on its own goods.</p>
<p>In short, more than any company on this list, the arguments against Amazon fall apart on the first point: Amazon simply isn&#8217;t a monopoly.</p>
<h4>Remedies</h4>
<p>Remedies by definition come last: there has to be something worth remedying! Still, it is interesting to consider what the appropriate remedy for each company would be if they were indeed found to be a monopoly engaged in illegal anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p><strong>1990s Microsoft:</strong> Microsoft was originally ordered to be broken-up, although this remedy was overruled on appeal. The idea was that Windows would better serve all 3rd-party software suppliers if it weren&#8217;t incentivized to favor its own offerings. Ultimately, though, the company agreed to open up its API, although critics argued that the specifics simply cemented Windows&#8217; dominance, instead of making it possible to build a Windows alternative that could run 3rd-party Windows applications.</p>
<p>The European Commission went further both in terms of requiring interoperability and also presenting users with choice in terms of both browsers and media players. In both cases 3rd-party competitors actually won in the long run — but they won because they were clearly better (first Firefox and then Chrome, and iTunes).</p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong> An effective Google remedy would likely be more about constraining Google behavior than it would be about restructuring Google itself. Google might be forbidden from offering its own results for things like local search, or be forced to feature results from competitors according to an algorithm overseen by a court observer. There would also likely be a large fine.</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong> The obvious remedy for Apple would be allowing 3rd-party payment processors for apps; frankly, I think this might go too far, as there are real benefits to Apple controlling everything API-related on the iOS platform. I would be satisfied with Apple allowing apps to launch web views for payment processing that is clearly handled on the app&#8217;s own webpage.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Apple could be forced to significantly reduces its App Store take rate, but I would prefer that Apple be forced to compete for payment processing business, which would achieve a similar result.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Facebook, fascinatingly enough, given its lack of anticompetitive behavior, has the most obvious remedy: break apart Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. I do believe this would be beneficial for competition: Instagram being an independent company would not only add another competitor for digital advertising, but would also make other companies like Snapchat <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/facebooks-story-problem-and-opportunity/">more competitive</a> by virtue of forcing advertisers to diversify. Again, though, this is more about a failure in merger review.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> Amazon has made anti-competitive acquisitions of its own, like Zappos and Diapers.com. Those platforms are gone though, making any sort of breakup unrealistic (this is likely at least one factor in Facebook&#8217;s plans <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/facebooks-privacy-cake/">to integrate messaging across its platforms</a> — that will make a breakup that much more difficult). And as far as selling its own products goes, not only is that probably not a problem, but <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-private-labels-not-hurting-most-sellers-2019-5">there is little evidence 3rd-party sellers are being hurt by Amazon&#8217;s policies</a>, and plenty of evidence that they are helped by having access to Amazon&#8217;s customers. Moreover, highly differentiated suppliers have found success prioritizing other retailers if Amazon squeezes too hard.</p>
<h4>The Future</h4>
<p>Ideally, an antitrust action is not simply about punishing bad behavior in the past, but also about ensuring competition going forward. To that end, it is worth considering whether the upheaval that would result from any sort of investigation would actually make a long-term difference.</p>
<p><strong>1990s Microsoft</strong>: Here the Microsoft case is particularly pressing. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/more-on-chrome-and-amp-the-case-against-google-chris-dixon-on-decentralization/">It is my contention</a> that Microsoft failed to compete on the Internet and in mobile because the company was fundamentally unsuited to do so, both in terms of culture and capability.</p>
<p>The implication of this conclusion is that the antitrust case against Microsoft was largely a waste of time: the company would have been surpassed by Google and Apple regardless (and that the company only returned to prominence when it embraced a market that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/services-not-devices/">suited its capabilities</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/">transformed its culture</a>).</p>
<p>Many disagree to be sure, arguing that the antitrust case prevented Microsoft from foreclosing Google, although it is never clear as to how Microsoft would have done so (nor any explanation as to why Microsoft failed in mobile, where they were not constrained). A better argument is IBM: the government may have ultimately failed in its antitrust case against the mainframe behemoth, but IBM did voluntarily separate its software sales from its hardware sales, setting the stage for its own disruption; then again, the bigger factor was that IBM simply didn&#8217;t care enough about PCs to lock them down effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong> I wrote that we had reached <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/peak-google/">Peak Google</a> in 2014; clearly I was wrong, at least as far as the company&#8217;s results and stock price were concerned, but notably the company is ever more dependent on search advertising. One of my biggest mistakes was underestimating the degree to which Google could monetize mobile, not simply through increased adoption but also stuffing results with ever more ads (which, in the limited viewport of smartphones, are even easier to tap on).</p>
<p>That, though, is also an argument that my mistake was one of timing, not thesis (still a mistake, to be clear). For all of Google&#8217;s seeming advantages in machine learning, the company has yet to come up with a true second act in terms of driving revenue and profits (with the notable exception of YouTube, an acquisition).</p>
<p>Frankly, I suspect this is why Google is the most at-risk in this analysis: when a company is growing, it has no need to engage in anti-competitive behavior; it is only when the low-hanging fruit is gone that the risk of leveraging one market into another becomes worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong> That analysis applies to Apple as well: the company introduced the &#8220;Services Narrative&#8221; in the 6S cycle, which in retrospect was when iPhone growth plateaued. Suddenly the rent Apple collected from apps was not simply an added bonus to a thriving iPhone business but a core driver of the company&#8217;s stock price.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is not as if iPhones are disappearing: there is still an argument to act for the sake of all of the businesses that will be hurt in the meantime. The same argument applies to Google: just because antitrust action isn&#8217;t necessarily causal when it comes to a company being eclipsed doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t be an important tool to maintain competition in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> As I noted above, Instagram bought Facebook another five-to-ten years of dominance. That, though, is itself evidence that social networks are not forever. Each generation has its own preferences, and as long as acquisition rules around network-based companies are significantly beefed up, the best solution for Facebook, at least from an antitrust perspective, is simply time.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> This probably deserves a longer article at some point, but I think there is reason to believe that Amazon&#8217;s consumer business has also slowed considerably. The company is pushing more into ads, squeezing its suppliers, and driving customers to 3rd-party merchants with their attendant higher margins (for Amazon). This makes sense: there are certain categories of products that make sense for e-commerce, and Amazon does very well there, but will — and perhaps has — hit a ceiling as far as overall retail share is concerned.</p>
<p>Indeed, a mistake many tech company critics make is assuming that graphs that are up-and-to-the-right continue indefinitely; nearly all of those graphs are S-curves that will flatten out, and it is dangerous making regulatory decisions without some sort of insight as to when that flattening will occur.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ultimately, when it comes to antitrust actions against tech companies in the U.S., there really isn&#8217;t nearly as much there as all of the attendant fervor would suggest. Google is absolutely vulnerable, Apple somewhat less so, and it is very hard to see any sort of case against Facebook or Amazon.</p>
<p>And again, this is probably a trailing indicator: Google and Apple have maximized their gains from their most important products, while Facebook and Amazon (particularly AWS) still have growth potential. I don&#8217;t think this alignment is a coincidence.</p>
<p>That is not to say that tech deserves no regulation: questions of privacy, for example, are something else entirely. Nor, for that matter, is antitrust irrelevant in the United States generally: concentration has increased dramatically throughout the economy.</p>
<p>What is driving that concentration matters, though: at the end of the day tech companies are powerful because consumers like them, not because they are the only option. Consumer welfare still matters, both in a court of law and in the court of public opinion.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[This year's WWDC presented an Apple that was finally ready to move past the iPhone.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article was previously title &#8216;Apple&#8217;s Audacity&#8217;</em></p>
<p>It is the nature of hardware that a computer the vast majority of Apple&#8217;s customers will never own was the headline from <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2019/">the company&#8217;s keynote</a> at its annual Worldwide Developer&#8217;s Conference (WWDC). The Mac Pro <em>starts</em> at $6,000, and will be configurable to a number <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/3/18651208/apple-mac-pro-how-much-top-spec-price-estimate-ballpark">many times that</a>. If you think that is absurd, or would simply rather buy a new car, well, you&#8217;re not the target customer.</p>
<p>At the same time, here I am, leading with the Mac Pro, just like those headline writers, and I&#8217;m not incentivized by hardware driving clicks: it was <em>fun</em> seeing what Apple came up with in its attempt to build the most powerful Mac ever, in the same way it is fun to read about supercars. More importantly, I thought that sense of &#8220;going for it&#8221; that characterized the Mac Pro permeated the entire keynote: Apple seemed more sure of itself and, consequentially, more audacious than it has in several years.</p>
<h4>The iPhone Plateau</h4>
<p>In retrospect, the previous malaise around Apple should have been expected. When a product like the iPhone comes along — and make no mistake, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">there are very few products like the iPhone!</a> — the goal is simply to hold on to a rocket ship. Growth was trivial: simply add a new country or a new carrier, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apples-run-apples-earnings-iphone-upgrade-cycle-iphone-china/">predict iPhone sales with eerie accuracy</a>. That all culminated with the iPhone 6, when Apple&#8217;s forecasts were finally wrong — there was far more pent-up demand for larger screens than anyone anticipated.</p>
<p>It turned out that was the peak: Apple would again miss forecasts with the iPhone 6S, but this time their mistake was expecting growth that never materialized, eventually resulting in a $2 billion inventory draw-down. The forecasts did get better, but <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-social-network/">as I explained last year</a>, unit growth never returned:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The 6S was the new normal: iPhone unit sales have been basically flat ever since:</p>
<p>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-1024x509.png" alt="iPhone unit sales over time" width="640" height="318" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3792" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-1024x509.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-300x149.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-768x382.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-5.44.14-AM-1200x597.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>  What has changed is Apple&#8217;s pricing: the iPhone 7 Plus cost $20 more than the iPhone 6S Plus. Then, last year, came the big jump: both the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus cost more than their predecessors ($50 and $30 respectively); more importantly, they were no longer the flagship. That appellation belonged to the $999 iPhone X, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-iphone-franchise/">given how many Apple fans will only buy the best</a>, average selling price skyrocketed:</p>
<p>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-1024x518.png" alt="iPhone average selling price over time" width="640" height="324" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3794" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-1024x518.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-300x152.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-768x389.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-05-at-6.02.33-AM-1200x607.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>From a financial perspective, it didn&#8217;t much matter where the growth came from — more units or more revenue per unit. The iPhone, though, was no longer a rocket ship scaling to new heights; it was an institution, something with roots, and something that could be exploited.</p>
<p>This changes a company: instead of looking outwards for opportunity, the gaze turns inwards. In 2018 I called it <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apples-middle-age/">Apple&#8217;s Middle Age</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple’s growth is almost entirely inwardly-focused when it comes to its user-base: higher prices, more services, and more devices…The high-end smartphone market — that is, the iPhone market — is saturated. Apple still has the advantage in loyalty, which means switchers will on balance move from Android to iPhone, but that advantage is counter-weighted by clearly elongating upgrade cycles. To that end, if Apple wants growth, its existing customer base is by far the most obvious place to turn.</p>
<p>  In short, it just doesn’t make much sense to act like a young person with nothing to lose: one gets older, one’s circumstances and priorities change, and one settles down. It’s all rather inevitable…The fact of the matter is that Apple under Cook is as strategically sound a company as there is; it makes sense to settle down. What that means for the long run — stability-driven growth, or stagnation — remains to be seen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The long-run came quickly: one year later CEO Tim Cook had to issue <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">a revenue warning</a> thanks to slumping iPhone sales; after four years of accounting for between 68-70% of Apple&#8217;s revenue in the company&#8217;s fiscal first quarter, the iPhone suddenly only accounted for 62%.</p>
<p>It might have been the best thing that could have happened to Apple.</p>
<h4>Three Announcements</h4>
<p>There were three announcements in yesterday&#8217;s keynote that, particularly when taken together, spoke to a company moving forward.</p>
<p>The first was the end of iTunes, which will be split into separate Music, Podcasts, and TV apps; device syncing will be handed by the Finder. This is both straightforward and overdue, but still meaningful: while iTunes didn&#8217;t save Apple, the application is the connective thread of one of the greatest growth stories in business history. There is a direct line from the introduction of iTunes in January 2001 to the introduction of the iPod later that year, then the iTunes Music Store in 2003 (upon which the App Store was built), and ultimately the iPhone in 2007. iTunes provided the foundation for everything that followed, and it seems appropriate that the application is going away at the same time that growth story is coming to a close.</p>
<p>The second was the introduction of iPadOS. This is, to be clear, mostly a marketing move: iPadOS is very much the same iOS it was two days ago. Marketing moves can matter, though: in this case — much like the Mac Pro — it is a statement from Apple that the non-iPhone parts of its business still matter. While the company was on the iPhone plateau it wasn&#8217;t so clear that management cared about either — both the iPad and Mac languished, the former in terms of software, and the latter in terms of hardware — but now there is real evidence the company is fully back in. That management no longer had a choice is besides the point.</p>
<p>The third announcement was the App Store on Apple Watch. While there was not any news about the Apple Watch being completely untethered from the iPhone — non-cellular models have no choice — it is a clear step towards making the Watch independent.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apples-audacity/#footnote_0_4237" id="identifier_0_4237" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The Watch will now be able to update itself as well">1</a> That, by extension, completely changes the Watch&#8217;s addressable market from iPhone users to everyone. This was likely Apple&#8217;s endgame all along, but there is more urgency than there may have been even six months ago, and that is a great thing: better urgency than complacency.</p>
<h4>Privacy and Purpose</h4>
<p>Last fall Cook gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVhOLkIs20A">a remarkable speech</a> at the 40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners in Europe. This was certainly not the first time Cook has spoken about privacy, but the clarity, purpose, and passion with which Cook spoke was striking. <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/facebook-and-virtual-reality-follow-up-tim-cooks-speech-on-privacy-what-about-china/">I wrote about the speech in a Daily Update</a>, so I will not break it down in full here, but this portion is worth highlighting again:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now there are many people who would prefer I never said all of that. Some oppose any form of privacy legislation; others will endorse reform in public and then resist and undermine it behind closed doors. They may say to you, “Our companies can never achieve technology’s true potential if they are constrained with privacy regulation.” But this notion isn’t just wrong: it is destructive. Technology’s potential is, and always must be, rooted in the faith people have in it, in the optimism and the creativity that it stirs in the hearts of individuals, and in its promise and capacity to make the world a better place. It’s time to face facts: we will never achieve technology’s true potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was only a month ago that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-fights-back/">Google made a very different pitch</a>, making the case that the services it created with all of the data it collected was a tradeoff worth making. Unsurprisingly, the two different visions aligned with the company&#8217;s two different business models: data collection is obviously integral to advertising, and privacy a differentiating factor for Apple&#8217;s high-end hardware.</p>
<p>What I appreciated about both company&#8217;s events, though, was the commitment. Google did not try to obfuscate or hide how its products worked, but rather embraced and dwelled on the centrality of user data to its offerings. Apple, similarly, emphasized privacy at every turn, and did so with passion: it felt like the fight for privacy has given the entire company a new sense of purpose, and that is invaluable.</p>
<p>In short, it is clear that privacy has become more than a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/strategy-credit/">Strategy Credit</a> for Apple. It is a driving force behind the company&#8217;s decisions, both in terms of product features and also strategy. This is particularly apparent in perhaps the most important announcement yesterday, <em>Sign In with Apple</em>.</p>
<h4>Sign In with Apple</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the question of privacy goes far beyond Google and Facebook — it predates the Internet. Starting in the 1960s companies began collecting all of the personal information on individual consumers they could get; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Wunderman">Lester Wunderman</a> gave it the sanitized name of &#8220;direct marketing&#8221;. Everything from reward programs to store loyalty discounts to credit cards were created and mined to better understand and market to those individual consumers.</p>
<p>The Internet plugged into this existing infrastructure: it was that much easier to track what users were interested in, particularly on the desktop, and there were far more places to put advertisements in front of them. Mobile actually tamped this down, for a bit: there was no longer one browser that accepted cookies from anyone and everyone, which made it harder to track. That, though, was a boon for Facebook in particular: its walled-garden both collected data and displayed advertisements all in one place.</p>
<p>Over time Facebook extended its data collection far beyond the Facebook app: both it and Google have a presence on most websites, and offering login services for apps not only relieves developers from having to manage identities but also give both companies a view into what their users are doing. The alternative is for users to use their email address to create accounts, but that is hardly better: your email address is to data collectors as your house address was fifty years ago — a unique identifier that connects you to the all-encompassing profiles that have been built without your knowledge.</p>
<p>This is the context for <em>Sign In with Apple</em>: developers can now let Apple handle identity instead of Facebook or Google. Furthermore, users creating accounts with <em>Sign In with Apple</em> have the option of using a unique email address per service, breaking that key link to their data profiles, wherever they are housed.</p>
<p>This was certainly an interesting announcement in its own right: identity management is one of the single most powerful tools in technology. Owning identity was and is a critical part of Microsoft&#8217;s dominance in enterprise, and the same could be said of Facebook in particular in the consumer space. Apple making a similar push — or even simply weakening the position of others — is noteworthy.</p>
<h4>Privacy and Power</h4>
<p>Still, <em>Sign In with Apple</em> is a hard sell for most developers who have already aligned themselves with Facebook or Google or have rolled their own solution.  And, given that developers want to make money, is it really worth adding on an identity manager that would likely interfere with that?</p>
<p>Then came the bombshell in Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j">Updates to the App Store Guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Sign In with Apple will be available for beta testing this summer. It will be required as an option for users in apps that support third-party sign-in when it is commercially available later this year.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple is going to leverage its monopoly position as app provider on the iPhone to force developers (who use 3rd party solutions)<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apples-audacity/#footnote_1_4237" id="identifier_1_4237" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="One unanswered question: what about enterprise single sign-on offerings like Okta?">2</a> to use <em>Sign In with Apple</em>. Keep in mind, that also means building <em>Sign In with Apple</em> into related websites, and even Android apps, at least if you want users to be able to login anywhere other than their iPhones. It was quite the announcement, particularly on a day where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650861/apple-department-of-justice-antitrust-authority-facebook-google-amazon-ftc-investigations">it became clear</a> that Apple was a potential target of U.S. antitrust investigators.</p>
<p>It is also the starkest example yet of how the push for privacy and the push for competition are, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/open-closed-and-privacy/">as I wrote a year ago</a> often at odds. Apple is without question proposing an identity solution that is better for privacy, and they are going to ensure that solution gets traction by leveraging their control of the App Store.</p>
<p>Note, though, that even this fits in the broader theme of Apple regaining its mojo: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/">complaints about the App Store</a> have been in part about data but mostly about Apple&#8217;s commission and refusal to allow alternative payment methods. It is a tactic that very much fits into the &#8220;get more revenue from existing customers&#8221; approach that characterized the last few years.</p>
<p><em>Sign In with Apple</em>, though, is much more aggressive and strategic in nature: it is a new capability, that could both hurt competitors and attract new users. It is the move of a company looking outwards for opportunity, and motivated by something more intrinsic than revenue. It is very Apple-like, and while there will be a lot of debate about whether leveraging the App Store in this way is illegal or not, it is a lot more interesting for the industry to have Apple off the iPhone plateau.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[If there is a new tech cold war, it is one with shots fired over a decade ago, largely by China. The questions going forward are about both leverage and values. ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Culpan declared at Bloomberg that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-05-20/huawei-supply-freeze-points-to-u-s-china-tech-cold-war">The Tech Cold War Has Begun</a> after the Trump administration barred companies viewed as national security threats from selling to the U.S., and blocked U.S. companies from selling to Huawei specifically without explicit permission. Culpan writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The prospect that the U.S. government would cut off the supply of components to Huawei was precisely what management had been anticipating for close to a year, Bloomberg News reported Friday. Huawei has at least three months of supplies stockpiled. That’s not a lot, but it speaks to the seriousness with which the Shenzhen-based company took the threat.</p>
<p>  There’s hope that this latest escalation is just part of the U.S.’s trade-war posturing and will be resolved as part of broader negotiations. Huawei, or Chinese leaders, are unlikely to be so naive as to share that. Even the briefest of bans will be proof to them that China can no long rely on outsiders.</p>
<p>  We can now expect China to redouble efforts to roll out a homegrown smartphone operating system, design its own chips, develop its own semiconductor technology (including design tools and manufacturing equipment), and implement its own technology standards. This can only accelerate the process of creating a digital iron curtain that separates the world into two distinct, mutually exclusive technological spheres.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Culpan&#8217;s overall conclusions, and dived into some of the short and medium-term implications of the Trump administration&#8217;s action in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-and-huawei-android-and-huawei-the-u-s-impact/">yesterday&#8217;s Daily Update</a>. However, to the extent that a &#8220;tech Cold War has begun&#8221;, that is only because a war takes two.</p>
<h4>The ZTE Ban</h4>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s preparation for this moment likely started last year when a similar ban was placed on the sale of American components to ZTE; as I <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-zte-ban-techs-trade-war-risk-chinas-delayed-approval-and-apples-pain/">explained at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Obviously the United States government cannot tell a Chinese company what to do. However, the U.S. government can tell American companies what to do, and that includes determining what technology can be exported, and to whom. To that end, countries like Iran and North Korea have long been subject to U.S. sanctions, which means that it is illegal for U.S. companies in many sectors, particularly technology-related ones, to export products to those countries (including digital products like licensed software). And, by extension, U.S. companies cannot knowingly export embargoed products to companies that then sell those products to countries covered by those sanctions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That ZTE was flouting those sanctions was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-telecoms/special-report-chinese-firm-helps-iran-spy-on-citizens-idUSBRE82L0B820120322">well-known</a>, and the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/technology/zte-china-fine.html">settled with the U.S. government</a> in 2017. The action last year, then, was in response to ZTE allegedly violating that settlement; at the same time, it was hard not to wonder if there was any relation to the ongoing trade dispute with China?</p>
<p>Similar questions surround this Huawei action: the Trump administration ultimately <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-agree-on-broad-outline-to-settle-zte-controversy-1526959695">made a deal to spare ZTE</a>, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-plans-temporary-exemptions-to-huawei-blacklist-11558397319">a waiver has already been granted</a> allowing Huawei to service existing networks and phones in the U.S.</p>
<p>Still, if you&#8217;re looking for the start of this &#8220;tech cold war&#8221;, the move against ZTE was arguably the bigger deal: for the first time the extreme vulnerability China&#8217;s tech giants have to U.S. action was laid bare.</p>
<h4>The U.S. Advantage</h4>
<p>While tech devices like iPhones are &#8220;Made in China&#8221;, it is important to note that little of the technology originates there — <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-estimate-china-only-makes-8-46-from-an-iphone-and-thats-why-trumps-trade-war-is-futile-99258">less than $10 worth</a>, in fact. Much more goes to component suppliers in the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/#footnote_0_4220" id="identifier_0_4220" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The relative order varies based on the iPhone model; the iPhones XS, for example, gets its very expensive OLED screen from Samsung in South Korea, and its processor from TSMC in Taiwan. Previous iPhone models sources screens from Japan and processors from Samsung.">1</a> (and obviously, even more goes to Apple itself).</p>
<p>The reality is that China is still relatively far behind when it comes to the manufacture of most advanced components, and very far behind when it comes to both advanced processing chips and also the equipment that goes into designing and fabricating them. Yes, Huawei has its own system-on-a-chip, but it is a relatively bog-standard ARM design that even then <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-estimate-china-only-makes-8-46-from-an-iphone-and-thats-why-trumps-trade-war-is-futile-99258">relies heavily on U.S. software</a>. China may very well be committed to becoming technologically independent, but that is an effort that will take <em>years</em>.</p>
<p>That is why the best that Huawei could do over the last year was stockpile supplies: the U.S. retains a significant upper-hand in this &#8220;war&#8221;. At the same time, cutting off Chinese customers like Huawei will cost U.S. suppliers dearly: high-value components by definition entail very large research and development costs and significant capital outlays for their manufacture; that means that profit comes from volume, and losing a massive customer like Huawei would be costly.</p>
<p>China has one other card to play: rare earth elements. These 17 elements<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/#footnote_1_4220" id="identifier_1_4220" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The elements are cerium (Ce), dysprosium (Dy), erbium (Er), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), holmium (Ho), lanthanum (La), lutetium (Lu), neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), scandium (Sc), terbium (Tb), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), and yttrium (Y) ">2</a> are essential for electronic components, and China dominates their production, accounting for over 90% of the world&#8217;s supply. The country flexed its power in 2010, imposing export quotas (which were later ruled illegal by the WTO) that caused prices to skyrocket, at least for non-Chinese companies, giving Chinese companies an advantage. To that end, it is certainly not a coincidence that Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3010977/xi-jinping-visits-rare-earth-minerals-facility-amid-talk-use">toured a rare earth mining and processing center yesterday</a>, accompanied by China&#8217;s top trade negotiator.</p>
<h4>China&#8217;s Protectionism</h4>
<p>China&#8217;s 2010 rare earth export reduction wasn&#8217;t the only shot the country has taken: in January of that year <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html">Google announced</a> that its network had been hacked by China, resulting in the theft of intellectual property, and that the company was reevaluating its approach to the Chinese market. Soon after Google closed down its China operations and directed users to its Hong Kong site, which was summarily blocked by the Great Firewall.</p>
<p>Google was hardly alone in this regard: YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook were all blocked in 2009, and since Google&#8217;s block sites like Instagram, Dropbox, Pinterest, Reddit, and Discord have been as well, along with a whole host of media sites like the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is where I take the biggest issue with Culpan labeling this past week&#8217;s actions as the start of a tech cold war: China took the first shots, and they took them a long time ago. For over a decade U.S. services companies have been unilaterally shut out of the China market, even as Chinese alternatives had full reign, running on servers built with U.S. components (and likely using U.S. intellectual property).<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/china-leverage-and-values/#footnote_2_4220" id="identifier_2_4220" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="This doesn&rsquo;t even address rampant piracy in China: the country was one of Microsoft&rsquo;s largest markets by usage, but drove revenue equivalent to the Netherlands.">3</a></p>
<p>To be sure, China&#8217;s motivation was not necessarily protectionism, at least in the economic sense: what mattered most to the country&#8217;s ruling Communist Party was control of the flow of information. At the same time, from a narrow economic perspective, the truth is that China has been limiting the economic upside of U.S. companies far longer than the U.S. has tried to limit China&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Not that the U.S. investor class cared: for U.S. component suppliers China provided not only revenue but scale; for hardware manufacturers like Apple China provided low labor costs and an increasingly sophisticated base of manufacturing expertise, and full-on design services for more commoditized OEM&#8217;s like PC makers. And while U.S. services may not have been allowed in China, U.S. venture capital money was certainly allowed to invest in Chinese startups.</p>
<p>The truth is that the U.S. China relationship has been extremely one-sided for a very long time now: China buys the hardware it needs, and keeps all of the software opportunities for itself — and, of course, pursues software opportunities abroad. At the same time, U.S. acquiescence to this state of affairs has denied China the necessary motivation to actually make the investments necessary to replace U.S. hardware completely, leading to this specific moment in time.</p>
<h4>A Question of Leverage</h4>
<p>To that end, and leaving aside broader questions about the Trump administration&#8217;s approach to trade with China, when it comes to a &#8220;tech cold war&#8221; I think the U.S. has the most leverage it ever will have: the U.S. advantage in advanced components, particularly processors and their fabrication, is massive, and will only grow if the U.S. is able to gain the support of countries like South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Yes, China will spend whatever is necessary to catch up, but it will take a lot of time.</p>
<p>The primary potential pain points for the U.S., meanwhile, are those same component manufacturers that China needs, whose revenue and profits will be hurt, rare earths, and Apple. The latter is more exposed to China than anyone, on two fronts: first, the company&#8217;s massive manufacturing facilities in China, and second, the importance of the Chinese consumer market to the iPhone in particular.</p>
<p>This does not guarantee that Apple will be retaliated against: Apple employs millions of Chinese, both directly in manufacturing and also component suppliers, and the Chinese leadership will be loath to leave any of them unemployed. And, on the flipside, Chinese consumers, particularly those in influential first-tier cities, like Apple products. I do think the latter is more likely to be impacted than the former: China can do a lot to disrupt Apple&#8217;s consumer-facing operations in China, as they already have in both <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-didi-and-occams-razor-uber-in-china/">services</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/daily-update-iphone-delayed-china-apple-watch-edition-xiaomi-done-worse/">iPhone sales</a>.</p>
<p>The other big question is if the Trump administration will levy tariffs on iPhones for U.S. consumers: to date Apple has been largely spared, but the U.S. is running out of goods to slap tariffs on; again the company benefits from its popularity with end users, who would be much more sensitive to a rise in iPhone prices than just about anything else.</p>
<h4>A Question of Values</h4>
<p>For obvious reasons, I think most people in tech are opposed to the Trump administration&#8217;s approach: not only is Trump unpopular in Silicon Valley generally (which means his policies are), but the near-term damage to U.S. tech companies could be significant.</p>
<p>At the same time, as someone who has argued that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-fights-back/">technology is an amoral force</a>, China gives me significant pause. On one hand, while the shift of manufacturing to China has hurt the industrial heartlands of both the U.S. and Europe, nothing in history has had a greater impact on the alleviation of poverty and suffering of humanity generally than China&#8217;s embrace of capitalism and globalization, protectionist though it may have been. Technology, particularly improvements in global communication and transportation capabilities, played a major role in that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for all of the praise that is heaped on Chinese service companies like Tencent for their innovation, the fact that everything on Tencent is monitored and censored is chilling, particularly when people disappear. The possibilities of a central government creating the conditions for, say, self-driving cars or some other top-down application of technology is appealing, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html">turning a city into a prison through surveillance is terrifying</a>. And while it is tempting to fantasize about removing &#8220;fake news&#8221; and hateful content with an iron fist, it is a step down the road to removing everything that is objectionable to an unaccountable authority with little more than an adjustment to a configuration file.</p>
<p>This is the true war when it comes to technology: censorship versus openness, control versus creativity, and centralization versus competition. These are, of course, connected: China&#8217;s censorship is about control facilitated by centralization. That, though, should not only give Western tech companies and investors pause about China generally, but should also lead to serious introspection about the appropriate policies towards our own tech industry. Openness, creativity, and competition are just as related as their counterparts, and infringement on any one of them should be taken as a threat to all three.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[At Google I/O, Google was the opposite of defensive: the company set out to make the case that its approach made for better products that makes people's lives better]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a company famed for its engineering culture, you wouldn&#8217;t expect a video at Google&#8217;s annual I/O developer conference to have such emotional resonance. And yet, just watch (I have included the context around the video in question, which starts at the 2:33 mark):</p>
<div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uQjgp-Q--I?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I liked that very much.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.45.21-PM.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.45.21-PM-1024x572.png" alt="&quot;I liked that very much&quot;" width="640" height="358" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4196" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.45.21-PM-1024x572.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.45.21-PM-300x168.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.45.21-PM-768x429.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.45.21-PM-1128x630.png 1128w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.45.21-PM.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>This was the most direct statement of what was a clear theme from Google&#8217;s entire keynote:<br />
&#8220;Technology, particularly Google&#8217;s technology, is a good thing, and we are going to remind you why you like it.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Google&#8217;s Mission</h4>
<p>As he opened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyRPyRKHO8M&amp;feature=youtu.be">the keynote</a>, CEO Sundar Pichai, as he always does, repeated Google&#8217;s mission statements:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO1.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO1-1024x573.png" alt="Google&#039;s Mission" width="640" height="358" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4191" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO1-1024x573.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO1-300x168.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO1-768x430.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO1-1125x630.png 1125w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO1.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>  It all begins with our mission to organize the world&#8217;s information and make it universally accessible and useful, and today, our mission feels as relevant as ever.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Pichai, though, quickly pivoted to something rather different than simply organizing and presenting information:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The way we approach it is constantly evolving. We are moving from a company that helps you find answers to a company that helps you get things done…We want our products to work harder for you in the context of your job, your home, and your life, and they all share a single goal: to be helpful, so we can be there for you in moments big and small over the course of your day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, the mission statement may be the same, but what that means for Google and its products has shifted:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO2.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO2-1024x578.png" alt="Google&#039;s goal" width="640" height="361" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4192" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO2-1024x578.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO2-300x169.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO2-768x434.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO2-1116x630.png 1116w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO2.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>  Our goal is to build a more helpful Google for everyone. And when we say helpful, we mean giving you the tools to increase your knowledge, success, health, and happiness. We feel so privileged to be developing products for billions of users, and with that scale comes a deep sense of responsibility to create things that improve people&#8217;s lives. By focusing on these fundamental attributes, we can empower individuals and benefit society as a whole.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This set the stage for the rest of the keynote, including the video above: Google spent most of the keynote demonstrating — both with actual products, and a whole bunch of vaporware — how Google could take a much more proactive role in its users&#8217; lives in ways they ought appreciate.</p>
<h4>Google&#8217;s Data Collection</h4>
<p>To be sure, not all of the demos were of unassailably positive use cases like helping an illiterate person navigate the world; take, for example, this demonstration of Duplex for the Web:</p>
<div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NIbw_DrUh_M?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>With the caveat that this is one of the pieces of vaporware I referenced earlier (Duplex, it should be noted, did finally launch several months after last year&#8217;s Google I/O), the demonstration is very impressive. What is worth noting, though, is the degree to which the demo relies on Google&#8217;s having access to your data; to that end, perhaps the most striking takeaway is that Google didn&#8217;t bother hiding this fact:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO4.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO4-1024x577.png" alt="Duplex on Web uses your data" width="640" height="361" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4194" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO4-1024x577.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO4-300x169.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO4-768x432.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO4-1119x630.png 1119w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GoogleIO4.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The implicit message was clear: &#8220;Yes, we have all of your data, but the fact we have all of your data is a good thing, because it allows us to make your life easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice that Aparna Chennapragada, the Vice President of Google&#8217;s AR, VR, and Vision-based Products whose video I opened with, makes the same point:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What you are seeing here is text-to-speech, computer vision, the power of translate, and 20 years of language understanding from search, all coming together.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To put it more succinctly: &#8220;Yes, we collect a lot of data. But that data makes amazing things possible.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Google&#8217;s Strategy Credits</h4>
<p>There was one more thing Chennapragada said at the end of her presentation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The power to read is the power to buy a train ticket, to shop in a store, to follow the news. It&#8217;s the power to get things done, so we want to make this feature accessible to as many people as possible.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is another feather in Google&#8217;s cap: it really does serve everyone in the way a company like Apple does not. Pichai made this point as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So far, we have talked about building a more helpful Google. It is equally important to us it for everyone. &#8220;For everyone&#8221; is a core philosophy for us at Google. That&#8217;s why from the earliest days Search works the same whether you&#8217;re a professor at Stanford or a student in rural Indonesia. It&#8217;s why we build affordable laptops for classrooms everywhere. And it&#8217;s why we care about the experience on low-cost phones in countries where users are just starting to come on-line, with the same passion as we do with premium phones.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What was unmentioned is that this is very much a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/strategy-credit/">Strategy Credit</a>. Google spends billions of dollars on research and development and global-scaling infrastructure in order to deliver superior products to, first and foremost, users on premium phones (who have a huge amount of overlap with the set of customers most attractive to advertisers). That expenditure, though, is a fixed cost, while serving a marginal user is effectively free; it follows, then, that the best way to leverage those costs is to serve as many people as possible, even if the revenue from doing so is quite meager, at least for now.</p>
<p>To be clear, to say that something is a Strategy Credit is not a bad thing: it is simply an observation that doing the &#8220;right thing&#8221; requires no trade-offs when it comes to a company&#8217;s core business model; I originally created the term to explain why Apple could commit to not collecting data in a way that a company like Google could not.</p>
<p>Even so, it is striking how Google leaned into its core business model during the keynote: while Facebook likes to talk about connecting everyone, the company mostly tries to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/facebooks-privacy-cake/">have its privacy cake and eat it too</a>, that is, talk a lot about privacy and major moves it claims it is making in that direction, while actually changing nothing about its core business (or acknowledging that those moves are for <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/microsoft-and-slack-follow-up-f8-facebook-versus-snapchat/">competitive reasons</a>).</p>
<p>Google, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t just admit it collects data, it highlighted how that collection makes Google more helpful. Google didn&#8217;t just admit that its goal is to be the Aggregator of information for every customer on earth, it bragged about that fact. And Google certainly didn&#8217;t engage in any self-effacing comments about how technology could be used for both good and bad: the entire keynote was arguing that technology is not only good, it is going to get better, and Google will lead the way.</p>
<h4>Google&#8217;s Opportunities</h4>
<p>There should be, to be sure, concerns about Google believing their own hype: many of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/youtube-and-toxic-videos-youtubes-problematic-incentives-sins-of-omission-and-commission/">the problems with YouTube</a>, for example, stem from <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-pollyannish-assumption/">The Pollyannish Assumption</a> that treats technology as an inherent good instead of an <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/friction/">amoral force</a> that makes everything — both positive outcomes and negative ones — easier and more efficient to achieve.</p>
<p>At the same time, from a purely strategic perspective, the positive message makes sense. Presuming that everything about technology is bad is just as mistaken as the opposite perspective, and the fact of the matter is that lots of people like Google products, and reminding them of that fact is to Google&#8217;s long-term benefit.</p>
<p>Moreover, a world of assistants and machine-learning based products is very much to Google&#8217;s advantage: the argument to not simply tolerate Google&#8217;s collection of data, but to actually give them more, is less about some lame case about better-targeted ads but about making actually useful products better. The better-targeted ads are a Strategy Credit!</p>
<p>It certainly appears that Google is pressing its advantage: after several years of including iPhones in Google I/O demos and/or alluding to products coming out on iOS — a welcome correction to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-android-detour/">The Android Detour</a> — the only mention of iPhones was in a camera comparison to Google&#8217;s Pixel phone.<a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/google-fights-back/#footnote_0_4189" id="identifier_0_4189" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="It was pretty lame that Google used an iPhone X instead of an iPhone XS for the comparison, though">1</a> Notably, Pixel&#8217;s headline feature — its camera — is very Google-like; Sabrina Ellis, Vice President of Product Management, said while introducing the $399 Pixel 3a:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Delivering premium features with high performance on a phone at this price point has been a huge engineering challenge, and I&#8217;m really proud of what our team has been able to accomplish with Pixel 3a…What Pixel is really known for is its incredible camera. With software optimizations we found a way to bring our exclusive camera features and our industry-leading image quality into Pixel 3a. So photos look stunning in any light. What other smartphone cameras try to do with expensive hardware, we can deliver with software and AI, including high-end computational photography.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While phones are certainly not a zero marginal cost item, the point is that Google applies overwhelming computer resources that can be leveraged through software instead of premium hardware, lowering the price of a phone, thus allowing it to be sold more broadly (better leveraging Google&#8217;s investment).</p>
<h4>Google&#8217;s Challenges</h4>
<p>At the same time, while many of today&#8217;s trends are in Google&#8217;s favor, the Pixel is a reminder that the company still has significant challenges: Google has struggled to sell Pixels not because it hasn&#8217;t invested in a quality phone, but because it hasn&#8217;t invested in marketing and distribution. To that end, what was even more notable than the Pixel 3a price point is the fact it will be available on more than one U.S. carrier for the first time; unfortunately for Google, that is only one country, and there remain the massive investments in marketing necessary to become a major smartphone player.</p>
<p>More importantly, while Google Assistant continues to impress — putting everything on device promises a major breakthrough in speed, a major limiting factor for Assistants today — it is not at all clear what Google&#8217;s business model is. It is hard to imagine anything as profitable as search ads, which benefit not only from precise targeting — the user explicitly says what they want! — but also an auction format that leverages the user to pick winners, and incentivizes those winners to overpay for the chance of forming an ongoing relationship with that user.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was both the promise and pitfall of Google&#8217;s overall presentation: organizing the world&#8217;s information was (relatively) easy when that information was widely available, and it was easy to monetize. Everything was aligned. The future, though, is a lot messier: getting information is more difficult, presenting that information is more challenging, and making money is very much an open question. Just because Google is better positioned in this race than anyone else doesn&#8217;t matter quite as much when the race is harder, even as the prize is less lucrative, while an increasing number of spectators are cheering for failure. Might as well bring cheerleaders!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The Zoom and Slack IPOs show what Microsoft is missing in its growth story: a way to acquire new customers.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is difficult to discuss enterprise software without at least mentioning Microsoft, and there is no better time than now: last week the company (briefly) became the third U.S. company, after Apple and Amazon, to achieve a market capitalization of over $1 trillion, and is currently the most valuable publicly-listed company in the world.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable turnaround, and, thanks to the fact that I started Stratechery just months before the exit of former CEO Steve Ballmer, it is one that I have been able to <a href="https://stratechery.com/company/microsoft/">document stage-by-stage</a>. The critical breakthrough was three-fold, and, as is so often the case, the three breakthroughs were really about the same existential question — whither Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, Microsoft&#8217;s leadership <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/microsofts-monopoly-hangover/">accepted that its nature was that of a horizontal company</a>, not a highly differentiated vertical one built around Windows.</li>
<li>Second, Microsoft <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/">embraced a world where Windows was one client amongst many</a>, and targeted its services to iPhone, Android, Linux, and Mac.</li>
<li>Third, and most importantly, Satya Nadella brilliantly navigated <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/">The End of Windows</a> internally, freeing Microsoft employees to build products that customers actually wanted, not that Microsoft needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important factor that made all of this possible, though, is that for all of the disruption that the enterprise market has faced thanks to the rise of Software-as-a-Service (Saas), Microsoft was remarkably well-placed to take advantage of this new paradigm, if only they could get out of their own way.</p>
<p>At least in part.</p>
<h4>The SaaS Business Model</h4>
<p>There are three parts of any new paradigm in technology: doing current use cases better, coming up with a new business model, and creating entirely new use cases. Microsoft, to Ballmer&#8217;s credit, was actually very early to the new business model aspect of SaaS.</p>
<p>Previously, enterprise software was sold on a license basis: companies bought software on a per-seat basis (or per-server or per-core basis in the case of back-end software), and when new versions of the software came out, they would potentially update — or not. Or not wasn&#8217;t great for anyone: companies would be running on out-of-date software, and vendors would not make new revenue.</p>
<p>What Microsoft figured out is that it made far more sense for both Microsoft and their customers to pay on a subscription basis: companies would pay a set price on a monthly or annual basis, and receive access to the latest-and-greatest software. This wasn&#8217;t a complete panacea — updating software was still a significant undertaking — but at least the incentive to avoid upgrades was removed.</p>
<p>There were also subtle advantages from a balance sheet perspective: now companies were paying for software in a rough approximation to their usage over time — an operational expense — as opposed to a fixed-cost basis. This improved their return-on-invested-capital (ROIC) measurements, if nothing else. And, for Microsoft, revenue became much more predictable.</p>
<h4>SaaS and Current Use Cases</h4>
<p>A more profound implication of SaaS, though — and to be clear, I mean software accessed over the Internet, not datacenter software paid for on a subscription basis — is how it makes current use cases more efficient for existing enterprise customers on one hand, and accessible for completely new customers on the other.</p>
<p>Start with enterprise customers: the reality for many industries is that their needs are variable. Sometimes they need more seats for a particular piece of software, and sometimes they need less; this is particularly pronounced in the case of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), where computing needs may change seasonally. The brilliance of paying on a subscription basis is that a company can buy exactly what it needs, when it needs it, and no more. Microsoft, again in credit to Ballmer, was moving this way with Office 365: seats could be provisioned on a monthly basis, with no major upfront expenditure required.</p>
<p>That lack of upfront expenditure, though, also expanded the market: buying an<br />
Exchange seat on Office 365 means hiring Microsoft to run your email server, something that previously needed to be done internally. Now all kinds of small-and-medium sized companies could use enterprise level software without needing their own IT departments.</p>
<h4>Microsoft&#8217;s SaaS Challenge</h4>
<p>This was also a challenge for Microsoft, to be sure: &#8220;hiring&#8221; SaaS providers meant it was easier to find providers that actually cared about modern use cases, particularly mobile. I wrote about this in 2015 in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/redmond-reality/">Redmond and Reality</a>, in the context of cloud storage:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Once you remove the burden of support and maintenance — that’s handled by the service provider — it suddenly doesn’t necessarily make sense to buy from only one vendor simply because they are integrated. There is more freedom to evaluate a particular product on different characteristics, like, say, how easy it is to use, or how well it supports mobile. And it’s here that Microsoft products, particularly the hated SharePoint, were found to be lacking.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is where Nadella made the biggest difference. It was notable, from a symbolic perspective, if nothing else, that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/when-ceos-matter/">his first public event was unveiling Office for iPad</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This is the power CEOs have. They cannot do all the work, and they cannot impact industry trends beyond their control. But they can choose whether or not to accept reality, and in so doing, impact the worldview of all those they lead. This is why it matters that the first public event Satya Nadella appeared at was Office for iPad. This is why it matters that Microsoft released it even though the Windows Touch version wasn’t finished. This is why it matters that Microsoft gave up the pretense of Windows Phone license payments that were already effectively zero and simply made it free.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the only possible route for a SaaS provider: the entire point is to host all of the infrastructure in one place, which means the greatest possible gains come from increasing the addressable market, which further means serving all devices, not simply the ones owned by one&#8217;s company. That, though, is the burden of incumbency: what is obviously right from the outside is often counter to what is obviously right when it comes to company cash flows and especially company culture.</p>
<h4>Zoom and Being Better</h4>
<p><em>Redmond and Reality</em> was about file-sharing software, but the broader idea — that SaaS changes the plane of competition from ease-of-integration to ease-of-use — is perhaps best exemplified by the rise of Zoom. It turns out that video-conferencing software is an exceptionally difficult technical problem, and Zoom has done a better job than anyone in solving those technical challenges. It is simply better than the alternatives.</p>
<p>Even so, if said video-conferencing software had to be delivered via an on-premises software installation, it is doubtful that Zoom would be as successful as it has been: just as important is that signing up for Zoom requires nothing more than an email address; a paid plan takes only a credit card. This reduction in friction means that quality matters more than it ever did previously, which is why Zoom is such a success.</p>
<p>The challenge for incumbents, including Microsoft and also other competitors like Citrix, Cisco, etc., is that years of building their business on leveraging their existing relationships with enterprises left them vulnerable to a company like Zoom singularly focused on delivering a superior product, at least once a SaaS architecture made distribution so much easier. Make no mistake, enterprise software still requires a sales force, but it is far easier to start with customers that have already discovered and tried the product on their own than it is to sell something without any sort of pre-existing relationship.</p>
<h4>Slack and New Use Cases</h4>
<p>There remains, though, one final implication of a new paradigm, and this one is the most profound: completely new use cases. This was something Slack sought to highlight in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm">their S-1</a>, which was made public last week.</p>
<p>First, the company argued that Slack transforms internal communications:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The most helpful explanation of Slack is often that it replaces the use of email inside the organization. Like email (or the Internet or electricity), Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but nearly anything that people do together at work.</p>
<p>  Unlike email, however, most of this activity happens in team-based channels, rather than in individual inboxes. Channels offer a persistent record of the conversations, data, documents, and application workflows relevant to a project or a topic. Membership of a channel can change over time as people join or leave a project or organization, and users benefit from the accumulated historical information in a way an employee never could when starting with an empty email inbox. Depending on the size of the organization, this might provide tens, hundreds or even thousands of times more access to information than is available to individuals working in environments where email is the primary means of communication.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Secondly, Slack argues that it changes what it means to integrate software:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Also unlike email, Slack was designed from the ground up to integrate with external software systems. Slack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 1,500 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Further, Slack’s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization’s internally-developed software. During the three months ended January 31, 2019, our more than 10 million daily active users included more than 500,000 registered developers. Developers have collectively created more than 450,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the three months ended January 31, 2019. Additionally, we are currently developing low-code solutions to create integrations and workflows entirely in Slack, suitable for all users and based on a simple, non-technical user interface.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a two-part challenge when it comes to introducing a completely new way to work: first, you have to convince companies that the new way to work is better, and second, you have to actually help them implement it. It is here that the Internet&#8217;s impact on enterprise software is the most profound:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the Internet is inherently viral, thanks to the fact that information can be transmitted with zero marginal cost. In the case of Slack, telling others about its benefits required little more than a post on social media, and over time, an invitation to a Slack team.</li>
<li>Second, and related to the prior point, it is actually cost-effective for Slack to provide a free product: there is no need for a customer installation, simply a few entries in a database.</li>
<li>Third, implementation is a matter of paying — and that&#8217;s it. There are no qualms about using scarce IT resources, simply a question about costs, and this decision is usually based on an originally-free implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gets at why I believe Slack is the poster child for the impact of the Internet on the enterprise software market: Zoom is in some respects a more impressive business, but its use-case was a pre-existing one. Slack, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new way to work, and based on its S-1, did so in a way that will produce a very profitable company over time (Slack is losing money, but at a far lower rate than it is growing revenue; this is a company that has leverage on its costs and will be very profitable in the future).</p>
<h4>What Microsoft is Missing</h4>
<p>Make no mistake: the Microsoft optimism that is driving a (near) trillion dollar valuation is justified. Azure is the biggest reason, of course, but Office 365 benefits from all of the dynamics I described above: <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/microsofts-earnings-microsofts-growth-opportunities-facebooks-earnings/">as I noted last week</a>, its market is increasing both in terms of current customers, new users at companies it already serves, and upselling all of those users to new functionality.</p>
<p>At the same time, the <em>reason</em> to use Microsoft is very much grounded in the past: Office documents are familiar, and Exchange remains the standard for enterprise email. The advantage of going with Microsoft is that everything works mostly as it has previously. That, though, raises an existential question that Nadella&#8217;s Microsoft has yet to answer: why would a new company, without any attachment to Microsoft-based workflows, choose Office 365?</p>
<p>Note that this is a separate question as to whether Teams, Office 365&#8217;s answers to Slack, is viable: distribution still matters in enterprise software, and Teams has valuable strengths that derive from its integration with Microsoft&#8217;s other products.</p>
<p>At the same time, even the bullish case for Teams is that it captures a <em>segment</em> of Microsoft&#8217;s existing userbase:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-04-30-19.08.03.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-04-30-19.08.03-1024x528.png" alt="Teams will only ever capture a portion of Office 365s userbase" width="640" height="330" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4164" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-04-30-19.08.03-1024x528.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-04-30-19.08.03-300x155.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-04-30-19.08.03-768x396.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-04-30-19.08.03-1200x619.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>This is precisely what you would expect from a product leveraging an existing use case and an existing customer relationship. Contrast this first to Zoom, which addresses an existing use case with the need to acquire new customer relationships: Zoom had a challenge building their initial customer base, but from that base they have growth opportunities both in terms of new use cases and also deepening their engagement with their customers.</p>
<p>Slack&#8217;s opportunity is even more striking: by virtue of starting with both new customers and a new use case, the opportunity to absorb both existing use cases (always easier than creating new ones) and also deepening utility with existing customers is significant. That is how you get IPO graphs that look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-30-at-7.46.35-PM.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-30-at-7.46.35-PM-1024x636.png" alt="Slack&#039;s cohort growth" width="640" height="398" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4165" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-30-at-7.46.35-PM-1024x636.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-30-at-7.46.35-PM-300x186.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-30-at-7.46.35-PM-768x477.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-30-at-7.46.35-PM-1014x630.png 1014w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Slack is not only growing users, it is also growing its monetization of those users over time, and it is fair to expect both to continue. This is exactly what Microsoft is lacking: at best the company is transitioning existing Microsoft users to a SaaS model, and keeping them away from companies like Zoom or Slack. That, though, is not a recipe for growth in the very long run.</p>
<h4>The Enterprise Growth Framework</h4>
<p>You can chart these three products on those two vectors — the pre-existence of a customer relationship, and the pre-existence of a customer use case:</p>

<p>This is where Nadella&#8217;s Microsoft has fallen short. The company has done well to leverage its pre-existing strengths into more valuable relationships with its existing customers and a viable option for new ones, and, as I noted above, has indeed moved into new use cases; Teams clearly goes in the lower-right part of the above graph:</p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-05-01-19.31.23.png"><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-05-01-19.31.23-1024x680.png" alt="Teams expands the use cases within Microsoft&#039;s existing userbase" width="640" height="425" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4168" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-05-01-19.31.23-1024x680.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-05-01-19.31.23-300x199.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-05-01-19.31.23-768x510.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Stratechery-2019-05-01-19.31.23-949x630.png 949w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The problem is that to the extent Teams is successful it is because it is exploiting Microsoft&#8217;s existing customer base, not necessarily winning customers who would have never considered Microsoft in the first place. There is not nearly enough industry-leading technology (as is the case with Zoom) or innovation in new use cases (as was the case with Slack) to engender confidence that the company can grow beyond its existing customer relationships in the very long run. This is why companies like Zoom and especially Slack are so valuable: they create new customers who are primed for growth; Microsoft, meanwhile, is mostly keeping its existing customers in-house.</p>
<p>This, then, is Nadella&#8217;s new challenge: the company could have acquired Slack early in Nadella&#8217;s tenure, and considered Zoom, but waited too long on both. Microsoft has figured out how to leverage its existing userbase: how to increase it remains an open question.</p>
