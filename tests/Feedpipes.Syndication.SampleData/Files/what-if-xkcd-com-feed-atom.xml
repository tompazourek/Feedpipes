  &lt;a href=&#34;//what-if.xkcd.com/157/&#34;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Earth-Moon Fire Pole&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;My son (5y) asked me today: If there were a kind of a fireman&amp;#39;s pole from the Moon down to the Earth, how long would it take to slide all the way from the Moon to the Earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;attribute&#34;&gt;Ramon Schönborn, Germany&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s get a few things out of the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, we can&amp;#39;t put a metal pole between the Earth and the Moon.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;For one, someone at NASA would probably yell at us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The end of the pole near the Moon would be pulled toward the Moon by the Moon&amp;#39;s gravity, and the rest of it would be pulled back down to the Earth by the Earth&amp;#39;s gravity. The pole would be torn in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Diagram from NASA Apollo planning archives&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/grav.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with this plan. The Earth&amp;#39;s surface spins faster than the Moon goes around, so the end that dangled down to the Earth would break off if you tried to connect it to the ground:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Professional driver on closed course. Do not attempt.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/break.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one more problem:&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Ok, that&amp;#39;s a lie—there are, like, hundreds more problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Moon doesn&amp;#39;t always stay the same distance from Earth. Its orbit takes it closer and farther away. It&amp;#39;s not a big difference,&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;You may occasionally see people get excited about the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon&#34;&gt;supermoon&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; a full Moon that appears slightly larger because it happens at the time of the month when the Moon is closest to Earth. But really, the full Moon always looks surprisingly large and pretty when it&amp;#39;s near the horizon, thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion&#34;&gt;Moon illusion&lt;/a&gt;. In my opinion, it&amp;#39;s worth &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/moonreminder&#34;&gt;going outside and looking at the Moon&lt;/a&gt; whenever it&amp;#39;s full, regardless of whether it&amp;#39;s super or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but it&amp;#39;s enough that the bottom 50,000 km of your fire station pole would be squished against the Earth once a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s ignore those problems! What if we had a magical pole that dangled from the Moon down to just above the Earth&amp;#39;s surface, expanding and contracting so it never quite touched the ground? How long would it take to slide down from the Moon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stood next to the end of the pole on the Moon, a problem would become clear right away: You have to slide &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; the pole, and that&amp;#39;s not how sliding works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;NEXT REST AREA: L1 (36,000 miles) (NO FACILITIES)&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/slide.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sliding, you&amp;#39;ll have to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can climb poles pretty fast. World-record pole climbers&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; there&amp;#39;s a world record for pole climbing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can climb at over a meter per second in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pole+speed+climbing&#34;&gt;championship competition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; there are championship competitions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the Moon, gravity is much weaker, so it will probably be easier to climb. On the other hand, you&amp;#39;ll have to wear a spacesuit, so that will probably slow you down a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you climb up the pole far enough, Earth&amp;#39;s gravity will take over and start pulling you down. When you&amp;#39;re hanging onto the pole, there are three forces pulling on you: The Earth&amp;#39;s gravity pulling you toward Earth, the Moon&amp;#39;s gravity pulling you away from Earth, and centrifugal force&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;As usual, anyone arguing about &amp;quot;centrifugal&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;centripetal&amp;quot; force will &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/123/&#34;&gt;be put in a centrifuge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the swinging pole pulling you away from Earth.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;At the distance of the Moon&amp;#39;s orbit and the speed it&amp;#39;s traveling, centrifugal force pushing away is exactly balanced by the Earth&amp;#39;s gravity—which is why the Moon orbits there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At first, the combination of the Moon&amp;#39;s gravity and centrifugal force are stronger, pulling you toward the Moon, but as you get closer to the Earth, Earth&amp;#39;s gravity takes over. The Earth is pretty big, so you reach this point—which is known as the L1 Lagrange point—while you&amp;#39;re still pretty close to the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;In countries with right-hand drive spacecraft, these points are referred to as R1 through R5.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/l1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for you, space is big, so &amp;quot;pretty close&amp;quot; is still a long way. Even if you climb at better-than-world-record speed, it will still take you several years to get to the L1 crossover point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you approach the L1 point, you&amp;#39;ll start to be able to switch from climbing to pushing-and-gliding: You can push once and then coast a long distance up the pole. You don&amp;#39;t have to wait to stop, either—you can grab the pole again and give yourself a push to move even faster, like a skateboarder kicking several times to speed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;SOURCE: I&amp;#39;m pretty sure this is a dream I&amp;#39;ve had.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/climb.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, as you reach the vicinity of the L1 point and are no longer fighting gravity, the only limit on your speed will be how quickly you can grab the pole and &amp;quot;throw&amp;quot; it past you. The best baseball pitchers can move their hands at about 100 mph while flinging objects past them, so you probably can&amp;#39;t expect to move much faster than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: While you&amp;#39;re flinging yourself along, be careful not to drift out of reach of the pole. Hopefully you brought some kind of safety line so you can recover if that happens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;This is definitely a dream I&amp;#39;ve had.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/oops.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another few weeks of gliding along the pole, you&amp;#39;ll start to feel gravity take over, speeding you up faster than you can go by pushing yourself. When this happens, be careful—soon, you&amp;#39;ll need to start worrying about going &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you approach the Earth and the pull of its gravity increases, you&amp;#39;ll start to speed up quite a bit. If you don&amp;#39;t stop yourself, you&amp;#39;ll reach the top of the atmosphere at roughly escape velocity—11 km/s&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;This is why anything that falls into the Earth hits the atmosphere fast enough to burn up. Even if an object is moving slowly when it&amp;#39;s drifting through space, when it gets close to the Earth it gets accelerated up to at least escape velocity by that final segment of the trip down into the Earth&amp;#39;s gravity well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—and the impact with the air will produce so much heat that you risk burning up. Spacecraft deal with this problem by including heat shields, which are capable of absorbing and dissipating this heat without burning up the spacecraft behind it.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[9]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;People often ask why we don&amp;#39;t use rockets to slow down, to avoid the need for a heat shield. You can read this article for an explanation, but the bottom line is that changing your speed by 11 km/s takes either a tank of fuel the size of a building or a tiny heat shield, and the tiny heat shield is a lot easier to carry. Thanks to heat shields, slowing down is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier than speeding up—which requires the aforementioned giant fuel tank. (For more on this, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/&#34;&gt;this What If question&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat shields only work for slowing down; if there were a way to use the same heat shield mechanism to speed &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, space travel would get a lot easier. Sadly, no one&amp;#39;s figured out a practical way to build a &amp;quot;reverse heat shield&amp;quot; rocket. However, while the idea seems silly, in a sense it&amp;#39;s sort of the principle behind both &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)&#34;&gt;Project Orion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21439582&#34;&gt;laser ablation propulsion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since you have this handy metal pole, you can control your descent by clamping onto it and controlling your rate of descent through friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;There may not be any sound in space, but you&amp;#39;ll feel it conducted through your bones.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/clamp.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to keep your speed low during the whole approach and descent—and, if necessary, pausing to let your hands or brakepads cool down—rather than waiting until the end to try to slow down. If you get up to escape velocity, then at the last minute remember that you need to slow down, you&amp;#39;ll be in for an unpleasant surprise as you try to grab on to the pole. At best, you&amp;#39;ll be flung away and plummet to your death. At worst, your hands and the surface of the pole will both be converted into exciting new forms of matter, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ll be flung away and plummet to your death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;It&amp;#39;s fine, I brought some oven mitts.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/grab.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you descend slowly and enter the atmosphere in a controlled manner, you&amp;#39;ll soon encounter your next problem: Your pole isn&amp;#39;t moving at the same speed as the Earth. Not even close. The land and atmosphere below you are moving very fast relative to you. You&amp;#39;re about to drop into some extremely strong winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Don&amp;#39;t worry about it.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/nervous.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moon orbits around the Earth at a speed of roughly one kilometer per second, making a wide circle&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[10]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Yes, I know, orbits are conic sections which in the case of the Moon is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; not exactly a circle. It&amp;#39;s actually a pentagon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; every 29 days or so. That&amp;#39;s how fast the top end of our hypothetical fire pole will be traveling. The bottom end of the pole makes a much smaller circle in the same amount of time, moving at an average speed of only about 35 mph relative to the center of the Moon&amp;#39;s orbit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;35 mph doesn&amp;#39;t sound too bad.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/bigcircle.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35 miles per hour doesn&amp;#39;t sound bad. Unfortunately for you, the Earth is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; spinning,&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[11]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;I mean, unfortunately in this specific context. In general, the fact that the Earth spins is very fortunate for you, and for the planet&amp;#39;s overall habitability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and its surface moves a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; faster than 35 mph; at the Equator, it can reach over 1,000 miles per hour.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[12]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;It&amp;#39;s common knowledge that Mt. Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth, measured from sea level. A somewhat more obscure piece of trivia is that the point on the Earth&amp;#39;s surface farthest from its center is the summit of Mt. Chimborazo in Ecuador, due to the fact that the planet bulges out at the equator. Even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; obscure is the question of which point on the Earth&amp;#39;s surface moves the &lt;em&gt;fastest&lt;/em&gt; as the Earth spins, which is the same as asking which point is farthest from the Earth&amp;#39;s axis. The answer isn&amp;#39;t Chimborazo &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; Everest. The fastest point turns out to be the peak of Mt. Cayambe, a volcano north of Chimborazo. And now you know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8203;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[13]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Mt. Cayambe&amp;#39;s southern slope also happens to be the highest point on Earth&amp;#39;s surface directly on the Equator. I have a lot of mountain facts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;1000 mph does sound bad.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/bigcircle2.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the end of the pole is moving slowly relative to the Earth as a whole, it&amp;#39;s moving very fast relative to the &lt;em&gt;surface&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Is it just me, or is the atmosphere piling up in front of the pole? Is it too late to turn around?&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/bigcircle3.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking how fast the pole is moving relative to the surface is effectively the same as asking what the &amp;quot;ground speed&amp;quot; of the Moon is. This is tricky to calculate, because the Moon&amp;#39;s ground speed varies over time in a complicated way. Luckily for us, it doesn&amp;#39;t vary &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much—it&amp;#39;s usually somewhere between 390 and 450 m/s, or a little over Mach 1—so figuring out the precise value isn&amp;#39;t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;I don&amp;#39;t see what you&amp;#39;re so worried about.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/stalling.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s buy a little time by trying to figure it out anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moon&amp;#39;s ground speed varies pretty regularly, making a kind of sine wave. It peaks twice every month as it passes over the fast-moving equator, then reaches a minimum when it&amp;#39;s over the slower-moving tropics. Its orbital speed also changes depending on whether it&amp;#39;s at the close or far point in its orbit. This leads to a roughly sine-wave shaped ground speed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;DO NOT USE THIS GRAPH FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. It&amp;#39;s not that it isn&amp;#39;t accurate, it&amp;#39;s just that any kind of plan that involves this type of data is probably a bad one.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/fastslow.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, ready to jump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;There&amp;#39;s always something else to calculate.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/calculate.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, fine. There&amp;#39;s one other cycle we can take into account to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nail down the Moon&amp;#39;s ground speed. The Moon&amp;#39;s orbit is tilted by about 5° relative to the Earth-Sun plane, while the Earth&amp;#39;s axis is tilted by 23.5°. This means that the Moon&amp;#39;s latitude changes the way the Sun&amp;#39;s does, moving from the northern tropics to the southern tropics twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Moon&amp;#39;s orbit is also tilted, and this tilt rotates on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle&#34;&gt;an 18.9-year cycle&lt;/a&gt;. When the Moon&amp;#39;s tilt is in the same direction as the Earth&amp;#39;s, it stays 5° closer to the Equator than the Sun, and when it&amp;#39;s in the opposite direction, it reaches more extreme latitudes. When the Moon is over a point farther from the equator, it has a lower &amp;quot;ground speed,&amp;quot; so the lower end of the sine wave goes lower. Here&amp;#39;s the plot of the Moon&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;ground speed&amp;quot; over the next few decades:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;\&amp;quot;The 2020s will have the lowest average Moon speed of any decade in my lifetime\&amp;quot; is a new contender for the least consequential thing I&amp;#39;ve ever learned.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/hazysin.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moon&amp;#39;s top speed stays pretty constant, but the lowest speed rises and falls with an 18.9-year cycle. The lowest speed of the next cycle will be on May 1st, 2025, so if you want to wait until 2025 to slide down, you can hit the atmosphere when the pole is moving at only 390 m/s relative to the Earth&amp;#39;s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;If you&amp;#39;re reading this before May 1st, 2025, please pause your reading until that date, then resume at the next paragraph.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/wait.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do finally enter the atmosphere, you&amp;#39;ll be coming down near the edge of the tropics. Try to avoid the &lt;a href=&#34;https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/isobaric/250hPa/orthographic=326.35,-1.08,372&#34;&gt;tropical jet stream&lt;/a&gt;, an upper-level air current which blows in the same direction the Earth rotates. If your pole happens to go through it, it could add another 50-100 m/s to the wind speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where you come down, you&amp;#39;ll need to contend with supersonic winds, so you should wear lots of protective gear.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[15]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;For aerodynamic reasons, this gear should probably make it look like you&amp;#39;re wearing a very fast airplane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Make sure you&amp;#39;re tightly attached to the pole, since the wind and various shockwaves will be violently battering and jolting you around. People often say, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not the fall that kills you, it&amp;#39;s the sudden stop at the end.&amp;quot; Unfortunately, in this case, it&amp;#39;s probably going to be both.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[17]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;If it helps, people &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; survived &lt;a href=&#34;https://jalopnik.com/5894022/what-happens-when-you-eject-out-of-a-jet-at-800-mph&#34;&gt;supersonic ejections&lt;/a&gt; before—and even a &lt;a href=&#34;http://roadrunnersinternationale.com/weaver_sr71_bailout.html&#34;&gt;supersonic aircraft disintegration&lt;/a&gt;—so there&amp;#39;s hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;SOURCE: Data from a NASA experiment/fun prank&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/shockwaves.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, to reach the ground, you&amp;#39;re going to have to let go of the pole. For obvious reasons, you don&amp;#39;t want to jump directly onto the ground while moving at Mach 1. Instead, you should probably wait until you&amp;#39;re somewhere near airline cruising altitude, where the air is still thin, so it&amp;#39;s not pulling at you too hard—and let go of the pole. Then, as the air carries you away and you fall toward the Earth, you can open your parachute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;We&amp;#39;ll wait here. Next window is in the early 2040s.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/parachute.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, at last, you can drift safely to the ground, having traveled from the Moon to the Earth completely under your own muscle power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;That&amp;#39;s one large, supremely complicated and unnecessary sliding-and-falling-and-tumbling step for a man, one giant but equally pointless leap for mankind.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/157/drift.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(When you&amp;#39;re done, remember to remove the fire pole. That thing is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a safety hazard.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;//what-if.xkcd.com/156/&#34;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Electrofishing for Whales&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;I used to work on a fisheries crew where we would use an electro-fisher backpack to momentarily stun small fish (30 - 100 mm length) so we could scoop them up with nets to identify and measure them. The larger fish tended to be stunned for slightly longer because of their larger surface area but I don&amp;#39;t imagine this relationship would be maintained for very large animals. Could you electrofish for a blue whale? At what voltage would you have have to set the e-fisher?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;attribute&#34;&gt;—Madeline Cooper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you want to give endangered whales powerful electric shocks. Great! I&amp;#39;m happy to help. This is definitely a very normal thing to want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various electrofishing setups, but they all operate on the same general principle: An electric current flows through the water, and also through any fish that happen to be in the water. The electric current, through a few different physical effects, draws the fish toward one of the electrodes and/or stuns them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;I&amp;#39;m just gonna set my drink on the safety switch so I can rest my eyes for a few. You have fun.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/156/setup.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, people didn&amp;#39;t really notice that electrofishing injured fish at all. For the most part, stunned fish seemed to be fine after a few minutes. However, they frequently suffer from internal damage which isn&amp;#39;t obvious from the outside. The electric current causes involuntary muscle spasms, which can fracture the fish&amp;#39;s vertebrae. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20170309145741/http://opensample.info/effect-of-electrofishing-pulse-shape-and-electrofishing-induced-spinal-injury-on-long-term-growth-and-survival-of-wild-rainbow-trout&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; shows, these kinds of spinal injuries are more common and severe in larger fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you mention, for a given electrofishing setup, larger fish are usually more affected than smaller ones.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;This can lead to larger fish being overrepresented in sampling studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Why? Well, we don&amp;#39;t know. In their comprehensive 2003 study &lt;em&gt;Immobilization Thresholds of Electrofishing Relative to Fish Size&lt;/em&gt;, biologists Chad Dolan and Steve Miranda modeled the way electric currents stun fish of different sizes, but caution that &amp;quot;no adequate conceptual system exists to explain the effects of size on electroshock thresholds from the perspective of electric fields.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these studies dealt with animals anywhere near the size of whales. The largest fish in Dolan and Miranda&amp;#39;s study were still quite small. &lt;a href=&#34;http://electrofishing.net/2016/01/23/535/&#34;&gt;This experiment&lt;/a&gt; tested larger fish up to 80cm long,&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;The fish they used in the experiment grew rapidly to a range of sizes, mainly because the larger ones kept eating their smaller siblings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but nothing whale-sized.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;There&amp;#39;s been at least &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150217-irrawaddy-dolphins-myanmar-electro-fishing-mandalay/&#34;&gt;one case&lt;/a&gt; of dolphin death linked to illegal electrofishing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since we don&amp;#39;t know exactly why larger fish respond differently, it&amp;#39;s hard to confidently extrapolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish are &lt;a href=&#34;https://nctc.fws.gov/courses/CSP/CSP2C01/resources/5-Power-Transfer-Theory-Standardization/2_Electrofishing,%20A%20Power%20Related%20Phenomenon.pdf&#34;&gt;typically&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Actual quote from that paper: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The results for these tests were unsettling ... this observation was so unexpected that we stopped the experiment to recalibrate the equipment.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stunned by equipment delivering about 100 µW of power per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of body volume, so for a whale, that would be about 20 megawatts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a catch: Most electrofishing is done in fresh water. Unfortunately, blue whales live in the ocean,&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;I mean, unfortunately for Madeline. It&amp;#39;s fortunate for the whales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where the salt water conducts electricity much more easily. That might seem like good news for our electrofishing plans, but it turns out to make it much more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrofishing works best when the water and the target animals are about equally conductive. In highly conductive saltwater, most of the current flows past the animals in the water rather than through them. This means that ocean electrofishing requires much more power. Using our simple extrapolation, instead of 20 megawatts, we might need a gigawatt. In other words, you&amp;#39;ll need to bring a large nuclear generating station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;All right, I&amp;#39;m just gonna nap here, but let me know when you&amp;#39;ve ordered a container ship on Amazon or whatever.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/156/boat.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple extrapolation is misleading here, since we know that large animals respond to electricity differently. How differently? Well, according to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://electrofishing.net/2015/12/30/man-overboard/&#34;&gt;electrofishing.net post&lt;/a&gt; by Jan Dean, a human who fell into the water in front of a typical electrofishing boat could easily die.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;While it sounds dangerous, people aren&amp;#39;t often killed during electrofishing accidents. The 2000 EPA report &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/30003TAI.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;amp;Client=EPA&amp;amp;Index=1995+Thru+1999&amp;amp;Docs=&amp;amp;Query=&amp;amp;Time=&amp;amp;EndTime=&amp;amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;amp;Toc=&amp;amp;TocEntry=&amp;amp;QField=&amp;amp;QFieldYear=&amp;amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;amp;QFieldDay=&amp;amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;amp;XmlQuery=&amp;amp;File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C95thru99%5CTxt%5C00000016%5C30003TAI.txt&amp;amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;amp;Password=anonymous&amp;amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;amp;Display=hpfr&amp;amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;amp;SeekPage=x&amp;amp;ZyPURL#&#34;&gt;New Perspectives in Electrofishing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; comments that &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;In the United States, since World War II, only about five electrocutions during electrofishing have been documented.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I assume they just mean records weren&amp;#39;t kept before World War II, but it&amp;#39;s technically possible that the war involved so many electrofishing deaths that they need to exclude it from the stats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blue whales, which are even larger than humans,&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean&#34;&gt;citation needed&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; would presumably fare even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Now I want to manufacture tiny defibrillator paddles and mount them in busy coral reefs.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/156/arrest.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrofishing temporarily &lt;a href=&#34;https://eurekamag.com/pdf.php?pdf=004141382&#34;&gt;stops a fish&amp;#39;s heart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Until reading this paper, I didn&amp;#39;t know clove oil was used as a fish anesthetic. You learn something new every day!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The fish seem to recover, most of the time, but humans—and probably whales—have a harder time with cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that giving blue whales massive electrical shocks isn&amp;#39;t as good an idea as it sounded at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say there&amp;#39;s no place in science for giving random electric shocks to large aquatic animals. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/symposia/repellents_symposium/pdfs/kolz.pdf&#34;&gt;A project&lt;/a&gt; at the Denver Wildlife Research Center used electrofishing-style equipment—linked to an infrared camera—to repel beavers, ducks, and geese from selected areas. Apparently, the results were &amp;quot;encouraging.&amp;quot;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;The equipment kept the beavers away, although they returned as soon as it was turned off. It also worked on ducks and geese, although they had some problems with infrared waterfowl detection. The birds would usually take flight when the equipment turned on, although if it was cold enough, they&amp;#39;d just sluggishly paddle away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So electrofishing equipment probably can&amp;#39;t help you catch blue whales. However, if you&amp;#39;re having trouble keeping them out of your backyard pond ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Sure, kids, they look like cute pets when they&amp;#39;re 5-ton calves, but before you know it they&amp;#39;ll be 150-ton adults who need all your time and attention!&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/156/pond.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... it&amp;#39;s possible the Denver Wildlife Research Center can help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;//what-if.xkcd.com/155/&#34;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Toaster vs. Freezer&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;Would a toaster still work in a freezer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;attribute&#34;&gt;—&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me&#34;&gt;My Brother, My Brother and Me&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-343-sauce-doctors-blessing&#34;&gt;Episode 343&lt;/a&gt;, discussing a Yahoo Answers question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maximumfun.org/my-brother-my-brother-and-me/mbmbam-343-sauce-doctors-blessing&#34;&gt;a recent episode&lt;/a&gt; of Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy&amp;#39;s terrific advice podcast, &lt;em&gt;My Brother, My Brother and Me&lt;/em&gt;, the brothers pondered a Yahoo Answers question about what would happen if you put a toaster inside a freezer. (The discussion comes around the 36-minute mark.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a fun discussion of a few aspects of the problem before eventually moving on to the next question. Since they don&amp;#39;t really settle on a final answer, I thought we could help them out by taking a closer look at the physics of freezer toasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Your ice cream has ... toaster burn?&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/155/setup.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(A quick safety note: If you actually do this, keep in mind that the toaster may melt some of the ice in the freezer, leaving you with a running electrical appliance in a pool of water.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Griffin sums up the situation like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;You put a toaster in a freezer. You run the extension cord in there. You put some good bread in there. You click it down. What even &lt;strong&gt;happens&lt;/strong&gt;, right? Because if your answer is, &#34;it would get hot,&#34; then the freezer hasn&#39;t done its job. But if you say &#34;it would get cold,&#34; then the toaster hasn&#39;t done &lt;strong&gt;its&lt;/strong&gt; job.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, the answer: The toaster would win. The freezer wouldn&amp;#39;t do its job. Toasters beat freezers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;The effect of freezers on bread turns out to be something everyone on the internet has an opinion on, so I try to avoid the subject by just eating all my bread as soon as I get it.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/155/power.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to think of a toaster and freezer as equivalent—one cools things down and the other warms them up. But toasters heat things up a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more than freezers cool them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coils in regular toasters get hot enough to glow, which means they&amp;#39;re over about 600°C. Since the toaster is operating at such high temperatures, it would hardly notice whether the surrounding environment is 20°C (room temperature), 4°C (a fridge), or -15°C (a freezer).&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;The zero on our usual temperature scales can confuse things, since it makes it seem like going from 10° to 20° is &amp;quot;doubling&amp;quot; the temperature. But the &amp;quot;zero&amp;quot; on the Celsius scale is just a point chosen by convention. If we switch to Kelvin, which counts in degrees above absolute zero, a freezer is 260 K, a fridge is 275 K, a normal room is 295 K ... and the heating element in a toaster is 900 K.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;[the markings on the worst thermostat dial ever]&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/155/relative.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toaster needs to heat its coils from room temperature to somewhere over 600°C. From the toaster&amp;#39;s point of view, a 20- or 40-degree change in starting temperature hardly matters. The coils will get hot, and then the bread will get hot, too. If the bread is colder at the start, the toaster will have to heat it a little longer to get it up to ideal toasting temperature, but it will have no trouble getting there. As anyone who&amp;#39;s ever burned a piece of toast knows, toasters are definitely capable of heating bread to above the ideal temperature for toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their discussion, the McElroys brought up another question: Even if the toaster can still toast bread at first, would it struggle to stay warm over time? If you left both the toaster and the freezer running, who would win in the long term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that the toaster would still win. A toaster produces about a thousand watts of heat, and the cooling system in a household freezer can&amp;#39;t remove heat that fast. In fact, since freezers are so well insulated, the inside of the freezer would probably get much hotter than the rest of the house, and eventually the toaster and/or the freezer would probably overheat.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Either device have a safety cutoff that stops things from actually melting down, but it&amp;#39;s probably not wise to count on that in this situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refrigerators and freezers work by soaking up heat from their interior and dumping it out the back.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;That&amp;#39;s why the area behind your freezer is warm, and why you can&amp;#39;t cool a room by leaving the fridge door open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In a sense, they&amp;#39;re more efficient than toasters. Fridges have a &amp;quot;coefficient of performance&amp;quot; of 2 or 3, which means it only takes them 1 unit of electrical energy to move 2 or 3 units of heat energy from the interior to the exterior. A toaster, on the other hand, produces 1 unit of heat from 1 unit of electricity. But since the compressor in a fridge-freezer typically only uses 100 or 150 watts when it&amp;#39;s running,&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;You can see some real-world graphs of refrigerator power usage, courtesy people with home electricity meters, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=fridge+watts+monitor+graph&#34;&gt;a simple Google Image search&lt;/a&gt;. The distinctive on-off square-wave pattern is the compressor switching on and off throughout the day, while the big spikes are the heating element that keeps frost from building up on the coils. This power consumption is split between the fridge and the freezer, but if the fridge is already cold, most of the energy will be spent fighting with the toaster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so even with the efficiency multiplier, it can&amp;#39;t keep up with the toaster&amp;#39;s 1000+ watts of heat production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the toaster will start to heat up the inside of the freezer. Even if the freezer were as powerful as the toaster, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to keep the toaster coils themselves from getting hot and toasting bread. The freezer can make the air around the toaster cold, but remember, to the toaster, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our air is cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Forget it, I&amp;#39;m going to hang out with that microwave instead.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/155/neg.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to live in the Canadian city of Winnipeg, you can check this experimentally. The winter temperature at night in Winnipeg is about the same as the inside of a freezer, so the environment there effectively simulates a freezer with infinite capacity to absorb heat. Suppose you put a toaster out on your porch one night, plugged in by an extension cord, and leave it running for a few hours, going outside every so often to collect the toast and put in some fresh bread. What will happen? Simple: You&amp;#39;ll quickly be eaten by wolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;&amp;#39;Doing a postdoc&amp;#39; is a Canadian euphemism for fighting off a wolf pack.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/155/canada.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But assuming you survive the experiment, you should find that the toaster doesn&amp;#39;t have trouble working in the cold air. It may take a bit longer to get the bread properly browned, but unless the wind is extremely strong, it should be able to manage it fine. After all, to a toaster, all weather is cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between what humans consider &amp;quot;cold&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot; is negligible in a lot of high-temperature processes. For example, Antarctica has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.antarcticfire.org/&#34;&gt;well-equipped fire department&lt;/a&gt;. It might seem strange to worry about things getting too hot in the coldest place on Earth, but fire poses a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/antarctica_fire_history.php&#34;&gt;serious threat&lt;/a&gt; to the researchers there. After all, the place is dry, windy, and doesn&amp;#39;t have a lot of liquid water sitting around to douse a flame with. Sure, it&amp;#39;s cold—but to a fire, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are no wolves in Antarctica. So as long as you don&amp;#39;t mind a trip—and you get clearance from the Antarctica fire department—you can go there to enjoy your outdoor freezer toast in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;For the record, I&amp;#39;ve never been to Winnipeg and have nothing against it! I hear from survivors that it&amp;#39;s lovely.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/155/antarctica.png&#34;&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;//what-if.xkcd.com/154/&#34;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Coast-to-Coast Coasting&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;What if the entire continental US was on a decreasing slope from West to East. How steep would the slope have to be to sustain the momentum needed to ride a bicycle the entire distance without pedaling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;attribute&#34;&gt;—Brandon Rooks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too steep to actually build, sadly. But for the next best thing, I suggest a vacation to the Hawaiian island of Maui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;I suspect this is the solution to many physics problems.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/154/maui.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the physics. Bikes coast downhill. On a long enough slope, a bike will reach a certain steady coasting speed. On a steep hill, their coasting speed will be faster, and on a gentle slope, they coast more slowly. If the slope is small enough, the bike will slow down and stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;I&amp;#39;m just gonna balance here until plate tectonics or something helps me out.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/154/slopes.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shallowest slope at which a bike will still roll steadily forward is determined by the bike&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;coefficient of rolling resistance&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, the formula for this minimum slope—measured in terms of vertical drop over horizontal distance—is incredibly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[ \text{Minimum slope} = \text{Coefficient of rolling resistance} \]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Slope equals coefficient of friction&amp;quot;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Sliding friction and rolling resistance work in different ways, but the coefficients are equivalent in these types of problems. If you want to be precise, you could use the phrase &amp;quot;coefficient of resistance&amp;quot; for all of them, but &amp;quot;coefficient of friction&amp;quot; is the more common term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a handy general rule in physics: The coefficient of friction between an object on a surface is just the shallowest slope at which the object slides.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;coefficient of static friction&lt;/strong&gt; is the slope at which the object starts sliding. The (usually lower) &lt;strong&gt;coefficient of dynamic friction&lt;/strong&gt; is the minimum slope at which it keeps sliding once you give it a nudge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Somehow, this makes me less nervous than seeing a glass sitting at the edge of a LEVEL table.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/154/tangent.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a nice bike under good conditions, the coefficient of rolling resistance can get as low as 0.002, or 1/500.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;You can browse some test data &lt;a href=&#34;http://biketechreview.com/tires/rolling-resistance/475-roller-data&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That means that to travel 500 miles horizontally, you&amp;#39;ll need a vertical drop of at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; 1 mile. To travel the roughly 2,500 miles from New York to LA, you&amp;#39;d need to start off at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; 5 miles up, higher than North America&amp;#39;s highest mountain. I suggest bringing oxygen tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;In this scenario, where there&amp;#39;s a giant slope stretching across the entire country, I&amp;#39;m somehow stuck wondering about the agency that maintains this sign. How many other signs are there? Do they send someone up the mountain to repair it every so often? Is driving from NY in a vehicle a cheaper way to access it than building an elevator to take them straight up from LA? So many questions!&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/154/distance.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But be warned—the trip could take a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bike&amp;#39;s rolling resistance mainly comes from the way the tire&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;And the ground, if you&amp;#39;re riding on dirt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8203;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;And the spokes and frame, if your bike is made of soft clay or something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8203;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Why do you have a bike made entirely of soft clay?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; deforms as it rolls, and it doesn&amp;#39;t depend that much on how fast you&amp;#39;re going. Air resistance, on the other hand, increases as you speed up, and under most conditions is the main drag force acting on a moving bike. To figure out how fast a bike will coast on a downhill slope, you need to calculate the point at which air resistance balances out the forward pull from gravity. At that point, the bike will stop accelerating. We can do that by using the formula for air resistance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[ \text{Forward pull from gravity} = \text{Rolling resistance} + \text{Drag force} \]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[ m g \sin(\theta) = g \cos(\theta) C_r m + \tfrac{1}{2} C_d \rho A V^2 \]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[ V = \sqrt{\frac{m g \sin(\theta) - g \cos(\theta) C_r m}{ \tfrac{1}{2} C_d \rho A}} \]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt; is the speed of the bike, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are the coefficients of rolling resistance and air drag, &lt;em&gt;&amp;theta;&lt;/em&gt; is the slope angle, &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is the acceleration of gravity, &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is the mass of the bike and rider, &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is the frontal area of the bike and rider, and &lt;em&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;/em&gt; is the density of air.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a very shallow slope of 0.2° or 0.3°, the bike would barely roll, and its top speed would be slower than a walking pace. You would need to add an extra few tenths of a degree to get the speed high enough to balance comfortably, and this would make the LA end of the slope even &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; than the already implausible five miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, bicycles are pretty impressive coasting machines.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Trains have steel wheels which roll on smooth rails, so they should have very little rolling resistance. You can work out their coefficients by looking over technical specs or calculating from first principles, but a cleverer way is by watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz866xD0pjU&#34;&gt;train-pulling athletic events&lt;/a&gt;. Then, with a little calculation involving &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Y4o_BqC0A&#34;&gt;the limits of human strength&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfyKkOOr4_8&#34;&gt;direct measurement&lt;/a&gt;, you can work out the coefficient from the other end. It turns out that train cars—at least, the kind used in strongman events—have coefficients of rolling resistance barely equal to that of a good bicycle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Skis, which are pretty good at sliding, actually have a coefficient of friction about 10 times higher than a bike&amp;#39;s rolling resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ski from LA to New York, a skier would need to start off 10 times higher than a bike to make the same trip. Instead of the top of a mountain, they would need to start from near the edge of space. Not only is there no way to build a slope that tall, but ice isn&amp;#39;t even stable at those low temperatures, so there&amp;#39;d be nothing to slide on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;We could ski down the steep side.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/154/skiing.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the longest horizontal distance you could travel on a bike with an ideal ramp is probably not more than a couple hundred miles, and that would require ideal conditions. In the real world, the longest such trip might&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;It&amp;#39;s billed as the longest, but I wonder if there&amp;#39;s a longer one in some random stretch of gently-sloping downhill road in rural Mongolia or something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=haleakala+downhill+bike+ride&#34;&gt;Haleakala downhill bike ride&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to take a 35-mile trip from near the 10,000-foot summit all the way down to sea level with virtually no pedaling required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;If you aim for the right spot along the coast, you can probably get quite a few feet BELOW sea level without pedaling, although swimming back up with the bike might be hard.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/154/beach.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if you can&amp;#39;t make it to Maui yourself, you can at least enjoy the video search results for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=bicycle+into+water&amp;amp;tbm=vid&#34;&gt;bicycle into water&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href=&#34;//what-if.xkcd.com/153/&#34;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hide the Atmosphere&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id=&#34;question&#34;&gt;Earth’s atmosphere is really thin compared to the radius of the Earth. How big a hole do I need to dig before people suffocate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&#34;attribute&#34;&gt;—Sam Burke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is straightforward: When you dig a hole in the ground, the hole fills up with air.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;The dirt you pile up outside the hole displaces air, so at first you won&amp;#39;t have much effect on the surrounding atmosphere, but the effect grows as the hole gets deeper and the pile gets higher. So keep at it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you dig a big enough hole, most of the atmosphere will flow in, and there won&amp;#39;t be enough left outside the hole to breathe.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;You need to remove about 65% of the atmosphere before sea level air becomes too thin to support human life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#x2060;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/46/1/25/661337/Human-responses-to-extreme-altitudes&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; points out, it&amp;#39;s odd—and likely coincidental—that the highest point on Earth happens to be just about exactly as high as the human high-altitude survival limit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;This was one of the first things I tried when I played Minecraft.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/153/hole.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere&amp;#39;s exact volume is tricky to define, since it gets thinner at higher altitudes and doesn&amp;#39;t have a firm boundary. If you compressed the whole thing to the density of normal surface air, it would be about 10 kilometers thick, and take up a volume of 4 billion cubic kilometers. 4 billion km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air is enough to fill a cube 1,000 miles high, which is nearly the volume of the solid core of the Earth. That gives us a rough idea of the scale of our hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;Extremely low-res Minecraft&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/153/cube.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging a hole that big will be a challenge. Even a hole the size of Massachusetts would have to be deeper than the diameter of the Earth to fit the whole atmosphere at surface pressure. A hole the size of the entire United States would need to be 400 kilometers deep, much deeper than we could actually dig.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;And if you tried to dig up the entire surface of the United States to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; depth, people would probably yell at you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! Air pressure changes with height. Air pressure goes down as you rise upward, which you can sometimes notice when your ears pop while driving on a hill or riding in a tall elevator. By the same token, pressure rises when you go downward. The air pressure in a deep mine is much higher than the pressure at sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem like the increasing pressure would help us fit more air into the hole. The pressure should compress the air, so a deep hole should be able to fit more than its &amp;quot;fair share&amp;quot; of air. But it doesn&amp;#39;t quite work out that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you go deeper into the Earth, the rock gets hotter.&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;Citation: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVkocdkcmAc&#34;&gt;Amiel, J., Eckhart, A. E., Swank, H., (2003) &lt;em&gt;The Core&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law&#34;&gt;ideal gas law&lt;/a&gt;, pressure compresses air, but heat causes it to expand. In the case of a hole in the Earth&amp;#39;s crust, the expansion from the heat of the rocks can actually counteract the compression from the higher pressure. Calculations in &lt;a href=&#34;http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/2506&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2060;&lt;span class=&#34;ref&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refnum&#34;&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;refbody&#34;&gt;This one is an actual paper and not a trailer for a terrible movie, I promise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; show that temperature gradients of more than about 30°C per kilometer will result in no compression at all. If the temperature change is faster than that—as is common in areas with thin crust or volcanic activity—the density of air will actually &lt;em&gt;drop&lt;/em&gt; as you go deeper, even as the pressure increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we compress the air some other way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;[6 hours later, we&amp;#39;ve forgotten what we were doing and have constructed a bouncy castle.]&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/153/pressure.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving tanks can contain air crushed by a factor of 200. A pile of diving tanks would only have to be a few hundred miles high to hold the entire atmosphere. If we want to compress air further, we can liquify it. Air is mostly oxygen and nitrogen. If we get air cold enough, it turns to a liquid with a density similar to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we liquified the whole atmosphere—and for the record, I don&amp;#39;t think we should—we could conceivably fit it all in the ground. We&amp;#39;d effectively need to remove a patch of the Earth&amp;#39;s upper crust, exposing magma veins and pressurized chambers, and we&amp;#39;d have to somehow seal all those off &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; keep things cool enough that our storage tanks didn&amp;#39;t melt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excavation would be a near-impossible challenge. But if you somehow solved all the countless engineering problems, you could—in principle—fit the entire liquified atmosphere of the Earth in a 5-mile-deep hole roughly the size of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you may not want to use that &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;illustration&#34; title=&#34;I promise to put it all back when I&amp;#39;m done.&#34; src=&#34;/imgs/a/153/texas.png&#34;&gt;
