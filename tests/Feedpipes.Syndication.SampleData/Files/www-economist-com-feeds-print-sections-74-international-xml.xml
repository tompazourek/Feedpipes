      <title><![CDATA[Are Western democracies becoming ungovernable?]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">A</span> SPECTRE IS&nbsp;haunting the rich world. It is the spectre of ungovernability. “Ungovernability in Italy is a great risk,” averred its former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in 2017. “It will be impossible to govern Spain until they face the political problem in Catalonia,” predicted the spokeswoman of the Catalan regional government in February (just before that government was closed down). Emmanuel Macron, for whom to govern is to reform, warned that “France is not a reformable country”, evoking the spirit of General de Gaulle who once asked how anyone could govern a nation with 246 kinds of cheese.</p>
<p>When you survey the political landscape of rich countries, you see an unusual amount of chaos and upheaval. Prague has seen the largest demonstrations since the overthrow of communism. More than a quarter of the current parliaments in Europe were elected in polls that were called early. In Britain the mother of parliaments has been at the gin bottle and opinion polls everywhere show increasing numbers of people losing patience with democratic niceties and hankering after a strongman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But experiencing protests or having weak governments does not make a country ungovernable. Moreover, as Tolstoy might have written, each ungovernable country is ungovernable in its own way. The problems of Italy, Spain and Britain are all...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Parliaments get facelifts; but it is politics that really needs one]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">B</span>RITAIN’S MPs were debating tax reform in April when water from a broken pipe started pouring into the House of Commons. This was unsurprising. The Palace of Westminster, a mostly neo-Gothic building that was completed in 1870, had for years endured rusty plumbing, crumbling stonework and sparking electrics. MPs gamely continued the debate. But Justin Madders, a Labour MP, saw in the deluge a symbol, suggesting how “many people view Parliament as broken”.</p>
<p>In a few years’ time MPs will have to relocate as the building is patched up, joining a long list of politicians in temporary digs. Earlier this year Canadian legislators moved out of the central parliamentary block for about ten years. Austrian MPs are meeting in the Hofburg Palace in Vienna while their building is renovated. Dutch politicians are preparing to vacate the 13th-century Binnenhof complex in the Hague. Parliamentarians in Egypt, Jamaica, Thailand and Uganda are all getting new homes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That should take care of the plumbing. And the new parliaments will be superior in other ways. Austria’s will have much more space available for public use. Jamaica’s new circular complex evokes an athletics stadium—a note of prestige in a sport-mad country. Members of Thailand’s House of Representatives will sit in a vaulted chamber named after the Buddhist Sun god. The “...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Space law is inadequate for the boom in human activity there]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">I</span>N MAY JEFF BEZOS&nbsp;gave an hour-long presentation on his vision for humanity’s future in space: a series of artificial settlements in orbit that would be home to as many as 1m people each. Mr Bezos was talking in his role as founder of Blue Origin, a privately held rocket-launch firm. But he also referred to the company for which he is better known, Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon would never have existed, he said, without pre-existing infrastructure: postal services to deliver packages; home computers to order goods; credit cards to make payments. The job of the current generation would be to build an equivalent “infrastructure” for space. Mr Bezos identified two elements of this: much lower launch costs and the exploitation of resources in space. But he might have mentioned another, more basic requirement for enterprise: a proper legal environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What rules there are largely date from the cold-war era. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 is the foundational space-law text. It sets out some basic principles, among them that space is free for exploration and use by all states, and that no claims of sovereignty can be made. Later agreements assign liability for damage caused by space objects and require states to help rescue astronauts in distress.</p>
<p>A common thread runs through these texts. They all assume that space is a realm...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Why are happy people voting for angry parties?]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">“H</span>APPY?” SPLUTTERS a middle-aged man at a polling station in central London, when asked about his feelings on voting in a recent European election. “I’d be happy if I could kick all the bastards out.”</p>
<p>He is not with the programme. In 1972 the king of Bhutan decided his country would adopt gross national happiness as a goal. At the time it seemed eccentric. But over the past decade, politicians in democracies have started to pay more attention to the idea that they should give priority to the well-being of their citizens. Thomas Jefferson argued that “the happiness of every individual [is] now acknowledged to be...the only legitimate object of government”. That view is now mainstream.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2008 the French government set up the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi commission to create new national accounts which go beyond GDP and reflect things like the quality of life and the state of the environment. Two years later Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, set up a “well-being index” to measure Britain’s happiness and social progress. And this year New Zealand produced the world’s first “well-being budget” in which health and life satisfaction—not wealth or economic growth—would guide some public-spending choices. In practice, this has meant more money to combat child poverty, domestic abuse and mental health problems.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[A brief history—and future—of credit scores]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">E</span>VERY WEEKDAY Lika Koplatadze, who sells consumer loans for TBC Bank, one of Georgia’s largest, calls between 170 and 250 of her compatriots. She does not choose her targets. An algorithm crunches the credit scores (a number between 0 and 400 indicating the likelihood of repaying a loan) of millions of Georgians, selects the best prospects and auto-dials them.</p>
<p>Something like this has been happening in rich countries for decades, but in Georgia it is a recent development. In 2005 a handful of Georgian banks joined with Creditinfo, an Icelandic group, to set up the country’s first credit bureau. Within two years the bureau had records on 232,000 people. Now it covers 2.6m Georgians, in a country with about 3m adults.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The impact has been profound. Loan officers used to make around ten decisions a day, says Vasil Verulashvili, who runs credit-risk management for Bank of Georgia, the country’s largest bank by assets. In the past if someone applied for a mortgage, “you have to check, is it the real purpose of the loan? You have to go to the flat: is it real or not?” he says. “Today we need less than one second to make ten decisions.” The value of loans has jumped from under 10% of GDP in 2004 to 56% in 2016. Average interest rates declined from 20.2% to 12.6%. “Everything starts from this,” says Mr Verulashvili, referring to...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[The Gulf of Guinea is now the world’s worst piracy hotspot]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">D</span>OCKED IN THE port of Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, floats a colossal oil tanker. Two layers of razor wire snake around its deck. Two life-sized human dummies in orange jumpsuits are perched on the ship’s bridge, posing as crew members keeping watch. Serving as a reminder that such precautions are prudent in Africa are the mangled steel and concrete remains of a jetty. It was blown up a decade ago by militants with a sideline in piracy.</p>
<p>The Gulf of Guinea, on west Africa’s southern coast, is the world’s most pirate-infested sea. The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reports 72 attacks last year on vessels at sea between Ivory Coast and Cameroon—up from 28 in 2014. This year so far it has recorded 30. Although some of the rise may reflect more complete reporting, Max Williams of Africa Risk Compliance (ARC), a security consultancy, says piracy remains chronically under-recorded. Ship-owners fear their vessels will be held up at port during an investigation. His firm estimates the real number of attacks last year was double the IMB’s figure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elsewhere piracy is in decline. Between 2014 and 2018 the number of incidents each year in South-East Asia fell from 141 to 60, and to just three off Somalia, which in 2007-12 faced this century’s worst piracy crisis. Under-reporting is also less of a problem in these regions...</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">M</span>ARTIN SALOMÓN has brought his dog, Manolo, to the “canine area” of a public park in Condesa, a wealthy district of Mexico City. As he watches the happy, free-running animals, he reflects on how dogs’ lives have changed. Mr Salomón, who was born in the northern state of Sonora, recalls that his grandmother had two dogs—a black one called Negro and a white one called Güero, meaning pale. They were seldom allowed in the house. And today? Recently he attended a birthday party for a friend’s dog, with a cake, candles and a party hat for the pooch.</p>
<p>In South Korea, some people who keep cats refer to themselves not as “owners” or even “parents”—a more condescending term that appeared in America in the 1990s and has spread. Instead they are “butlers”. Some take their feline masters to a cat hotel in the Gangnam district of Seoul. It resembles a beauty studio, with plump cushions and pastel colours. The rooms and suites, costing $35-50 for a day, are equipped with ridges and tunnels for the cats to play in, as well as cameras and microphones. “It’s so the cats can hear their butlers’ voices,” explains the owner, Cho Hanna.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Keeping pets is hardly novel; nor is pampering them. Archaeologists have discovered graves from more than 10,000 years ago containing the skeletons of humans and dogs. Some of the dogs suffered from diseases,...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Air-traffic control is a mess]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">A</span>T FIRST GLANCE, the industrial estate near Maastricht’s out-of-the-way airport, hardly appears the future of civil aviation. But it houses the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), where up to 100 air-traffic controllers work at a time to ensure that planes flying high above Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and north-western Germany do not bump into each other. Covering one of Europe’s busiest air spaces, every day its controllers guide 1,200 planes through a 16km (10-mile) gap in Belgium between two military no-flight zones—without any near misses.</p>
<p>Founded in 1972 by Eurocontrol, an intergovernmental agency, MUAC was the world’s first attempt to pool controllers between countries. Still the only such venture, it is one of the most modern and cost-efficient control centres in Europe. That is partly thanks to its use of technology. Pilots and controllers at MUAC, for instance, communicate through digital messages—much faster than speaking over a two-way radio. “Here is the future,” beams John Santurbano, MUAC’s director. It is a future few countries are embracing, though rising congestion is making flight delays and cancellations more common across the world.</p>

<p>MUAC’s control room, alas, is far from typical. Most air-traffic controllers still rely on technologies...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Magic mushrooms, illegal in most places, may have therapeutic uses]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">“M</span>Y CHILDHOOD was similar to those of many immigrants: my parents were under a lot of stress, and there was violence and alcoholism in the family,” says Carlos Plazola. “When I was under stress, I reacted with fear and anxiety. I always regretted my responses, but I couldn’t override them. After a mushroom journey, I found new ways to respond that included compassion and empathy.” That is why Mr Plazola joined Decriminalise Nature Oakland, a group which this week persuaded the council of the Californian city in effect to tolerate the consumption of magic mushrooms and other psychoactive plants and fungi. Last month Denver voted to do the same, but just for magic mushrooms. A campaign in Oregon wants to legalise their use by registered therapists. A Republican state senator in Iowa, Jeff Shipley, has filed a bill to allow the use of psilocybin and other hallucinogens for medical purposes.</p>
<p>After half a century, psychedelic drugs are inching in from the cold. Magic mushrooms, whose active ingredient is psilocybin, are in the vanguard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Attitudes towards the drug may be moving back towards those prevalent in the 1950s and early 1960s, when psychedelics elicited interest rather than horror among ordinary Americans. The name “magic mushrooms” was coined, improbably, by a headline writer in stodgy old <em class="Italic">Life...</em></p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Psychedelic tourism is a niche but growing market]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">“I</span>T WAS LIKE being transported into a parallel dimension of eternal unfolding completeness and divine bliss. Very powerful, direct and overwhelming. It was a big surprise, but also incredibly obvious. A ‘Doh!’ moment, rather like Homer Simpson,” says Guy, a South African who runs an online-marketing company from Stockholm, and who attended a retreat last month organised by the Psychedelic Society, a British outfit, at a rural artist’s haven in the north-east of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Magic mushrooms were banned in the Netherlands in 2007, after a 17-year-old partaker jumped off a bridge. But “truffles”, a form of the mushrooms that grow underground, are legal, and underpin a growing business in weekend trips. Prices for the Psychedelic Society’s retreats range from £550 ($700), for those on low incomes, to £1,200. Applicants are screened to weed out people who should not take the drug, such as those who have had psychotic episodes. The society has organised retreats for three years and now runs one most weekends. The waiting list is in the hundreds.</p>
<p></p>

      <title><![CDATA[Malaria is fighting back against efforts to eliminate it]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">T</span>HESE SHOULD be hopeful days for those battling malaria. Deaths from the disease have fallen to around 435,000 a year, from perhaps five times that number a century ago. On May 22nd the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Algeria and Argentina malaria-free, bringing to 38 the number of countries now officially rid of the disease. Algeria will be regarded as a particular success because it is in Africa. The continent suffered 90% of an estimated 219m cases worldwide in 2017. But two big clouds darken the outlook. One is the stubborn persistence of malaria south of the Sahara. The other is the emergence of new strains of the disease resistant to the available treatments.</p>
<p>Fewer Africans are dying from malaria but the estimated number of cases has barely changed since 2011. Ten African countries and India account for 70% of global cases. Numbers in India are falling, but not in the worst-afflicted African countries. Some places, such as Zambia (see <a href="https://www.economist.com/node/21764605" target="_blank">article</a>), are trying hard to tackle the disease. But malaria is proving resilient. One reason may be the declining share of families that use anti-mosquito sprays in their homes. Another may be resistance to the insecticides used in bed nets or sprays. And, though about three-quarters of the $3.1bn the world spends to...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Zambia cuts malaria fatalities, but not the number of cases]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">“I</span>T’S BEEN a good day!” says Godwin Mathao, an elder in the village of Mwanga in south-west Zambia. Health workers have tested 34 locals for malaria. None has the disease. Such progress is difficult here—villagers often cross borders with Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. It has also been hard, says Mr Mathao, to educate people about parasite-hosting mosquitoes. He points to a few houses where insecticide-treated bed nets are still used to protect vegetables from hungry chickens.</p>
<p>Africa is where malaria is most tenacious. Nigeria alone has 25% of global cases. Congo and Mozambique have 11% and 5% respectively. Zambia has tried hard to tackle the disease. It was the first African country to use artemisinin combination therapy, the recommended treatment. Some 70% of Zambians have access to treated bed nets or indoor sprays. Most anti-malaria funding comes from the American government or via the Global Fund. Zambia’s government works well with foreign groups such as the JC Flowers Foundation, which funds efforts at border villages like Mwanga. But it also spends more of its own money per person at risk than its peers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the WHO, reported deaths fell from 9,369 in 2001 to fewer than 1,425 in 2017. But the number of cases—3.5m a year—has barely budged since 2014. Zambia hopes by 2021 to become the first sub-...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[How climate change can fuel wars]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">O</span>N THE OUTSKIRTS of Baga Sola, a small town in Chad not far from the border with Nigeria, is a refugee camp called Dar es Salaam. The name means “haven of peace”, but the surrounding area is an inferno of war, spilling across the borders of four countries: Chad, Nigeria, Niger and Cameroon. Some 2.4m people have been forced to flee the fighting.</p>
<p>The most obvious cause of their suffering is ideological. The jihadists of Boko Haram want to establish a caliphate, snuffing out such sins as Western-style education and imposing a harsh form of sharia (Islamic law) as the sole system of government. To this end, they torch villages, behead aid-workers and enslave or strap bombs to young girls.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Religious extremism is not the war’s only fuel. Poverty is another. Boko Haram would find it harder to recruit footsoldiers if hungry young men did not see picking up a rifle as an attractive career move, leading as it does to opportunities for pillage. Another factor is oppressive, ineffectual government, which gives locals little to cheer about and plenty of grievances against which to fight. All four countries are cursed with predatory, incompetent officials and security forces. But in addition to all these long-standing ills is an aggravating factor created far away, in industrialised countries: climate change.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">O</span>F ALL DONALD TRUMP’s beefs with the “mainstream media”, it may be the least likely. Those po-faced purveyors of fake news, claims the president, do not take him seriously as a comedian. “He has a great sense of humour that he doesn’t get credit for,” explains a White House official.</p>
<p>So, credit where credit is due. The expansive, largely unscripted, disquisitions with which Mr Trump entertains his rallies are less traditional “speeches” than a stand-up comedy routine. Instead of tedious policy pronouncements and fine phrasemaking, his audience is treated to an impromptu circus of gags, pouts, gibes, mimicry and put-downs: “Pocahontas” for Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator and candidate for presidential nomination (because of allegations that she exaggerated her native-American heritage); “One Per Cent” for another Democratic contender, Joe Biden (a wildly inaccurate summary of his poll ratings), and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>David Litt, who used to write jokes for Barack Obama, acknowledges that Mr Trump has a great feel for his audience and the “skill-set of a comedian”. In treating politics as a joke-filled prank, Mr Trump is, as so often, right on trend. Ukraine has just gone one better. On April 21st it elected Volodymyr Zelensky, a professional comedian and television star, as president.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[What Caster Semenya’s case means for women’s sport]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">F</span>EW ATHLETES have been as blessed and cursed as Caster Semenya. All that the 28-year-old South African has ever done is run as fast as her legs could carry her—fast enough to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals over 800 metres. But her remarkable body has also drawn ridicule, speculation and a decade of investigation.</p>
<p>In 2009, when she breezed to a World Championship title, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the sport’s governing body, began examining whether she might be intersex—an umbrella term for people with developmental conditions affecting the genitalia and gonads. To protect her privacy, the findings are unpublished. The IAAF has since been in a regulatory tussle about whether Ms Semenya must adjust her testosterone levels to compete as a woman. On May 1st the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), an international court for sports, ruled against her. Its decision covers only athletes with one of a group of syndromes known as 46,XY, which means that a person with a male Y chromosome and high testosterone does not develop male genitalia. The ruling has implications far beyond Ms Semenya’s sport—and indeed, beyond sport itself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CAS allowed the IAAF to impose a limit of 5 nanomoles of testosterone per litre of blood (nmol/L) on runners with 46,XY conditions. This threshold is far below...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Global meat-eating is on the rise, bringing surprising benefits]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">T</span>HINGS WERE different 28 years ago, when Zhou Xueyu and her husband moved from the coastal province of Shandong to Beijing and began selling fresh pork. The Xinfadi agricultural market where they opened their stall was then a small outpost of the capital. Only at the busiest times of year, around holidays, might the couple sell more than 100kg of meat in a day. With China’s economic boom just beginning, pork was still a luxury for most people.</p>
<p>Ms Zhou now sells about two tonnes of meat a day. In between expert whacks of her heavy cleaver, she explains how her business has grown. She used to rely on a few suppliers in nearby provinces. Now the meat travels along China’s excellent motorway network from as far away as Heilongjiang, in the far north-east, and Sichuan, in the south-west. The Xinfadi market has changed, too. It is 100 times larger than when it opened in 1988, and now lies within Beijing, which has sprawled around it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Between 1961 and 2013 the average Chinese person went from eating 4kg of meat a year to 62kg. Half of the world’s pork is eaten in the country. More liberal agricultural policies have allowed farms to produce more—in 1961 China was suffering under the awful experiment in collectivisation known as the “great leap forward”. But the main reason the Chinese are eating more meat is simply that they...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[How monarchies survive modernity]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">O</span>N APRIL 18th Akihito, the 125th emperor of Japan and descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, returned to a shrine the sword extracted by Amaterasu’s brother Susanowo from a vanquished monster’s tail and a necklace stolen by Susanowo from his sister, thus reuniting them with a mirror used to tempt Amaterasu out of the cave where she had hidden from her brother. This ceremony, pictured above, was one of nine required before the emperor’s abdication on April 30th, which will bring an end to the Heisei (“achieving peace”) era. The next day, his son, Naruhito, will ascend the throne, and a new era, Reiwa (“beautiful harmony”), can begin.</p>
<p>If monarchy did not exist, nobody would invent it today. Its legitimacy stems from ancient ritual and childish stories, not from a system based on reason and intended to achieve good governance. It transfers power through a mechanism which promotes congenital defects rather than intelligence. It is sexist, classist, racist and designed specifically to prevent diversity, equality and personal merit from creeping into its inbred ranks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 20th century seemed to herald its demise (see chart). Revolutions and a couple of world wars brought monarchies tumbling down across Europe; they clung on only in the southern, northern and western peripheries. Republican movements flourished, including in...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[How to predict when a despot will fall]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">T</span>HE REMOVALS in the same month of two presidents—Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria and Omar al-Bashir of Sudan—look like an unforeseeable coincidence. But they are also two more data points for analysts trying to turn the art of predicting political upheaval into something approaching a science. Some believe they have the tools to make an attempt.</p>
<p>Coups and revolutions present unique challenges for forecasters. They are both extremely rare and, notes Andreas Beger of Predictive Heuristics, a consultancy, by definition conspiratorial—they do not advertise themselves in advance. Perhaps the most rigorous quantitative forecast of political upheaval comes from One Earth Future (OEF), an NGO based in Colorado that publishes a predictive model, CoupCast. It reckons that the factors correlating most strongly with the risk of a coup include: the rate of economic growth; how long a regime has been in power; how long since a country’s most recent coup; and whether it has been hit by extreme weather, such as a flood or a drought (see chart).</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Sudan and Algeria overthrow despots but not their political systems]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">O</span>N THE STREETS of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, people are breathing a heady mix of fear and hope. Since April 11th, when a cabal of army officers pushed out the 75-year-old Omar al-Bashir, the country’s president for the past 30 years, Sudan has had two more of its bloodied leaders step down. On April 12th, just a day after taking control, Awad Ibn Auf, the defence minister and head of the self-appointed “transitional military council”, resigned. The next day, so did Salah Abdallah Gosh, the head of the much-feared National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).</p>
<p>On April 13th the latest military leader, Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan, announced his intention to “uproot” the military government, prosecute those guilty of killing protesters and reform the NISS. He has promised to hand power over to civilians within two years. The protesters camped outside the defence ministry over the past week have succeeded in changing their country.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet they have plenty to worry about. “There are so many militias, so many armed groups, it’s very scary,” says Hamid Murtada, an activist among those protesting. Fights have already broken out between soldiers affiliated with different parts of the Sudanese state. Gunfire is heard at night. The soldiers now in charge might concede more to the protesters, perhaps even allowing a...</p>]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Kidney donors are wanted, dead or alive]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><span data-caps="initial">M</span>ELISSA BENSOUDA, of Kansas City, Missouri, was 25 when she was diagnosed with late-stage kidney disease. She had to start dialysis, hooking up three times a week to a machine that filtered her blood. “It wipes you out,” she says. Queasy and fatigued, Ms Bensouda struggled to care for her children and to keep working full time. To secure a place on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, she had to tackle other health problems first. It took a year and cost $10,000 to treat dental problems, to which people with kidney disease are prone. In 2012, after nearly ten years on dialysis, Ms Bensouda was given a transplant. The new kidney lasted only five years. So she is back on the waiting list—along with 95,000 other Americans.</p>
<p>In a typical year just one in five of them would get a transplant. One in ten would die or become too sick and drop off the list. Europe struggles, too. In the European Union in 2013 more than 4,000 patients died while on a kidney waiting list.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And waiting lists are often just the tip of an iceberg. Many patients in Europe, for example, suspect that doctors prefer to keep them on dialysis—which is a big, lucrative business—rather than to get them fit for a transplant. In America many people who need a transplant never join the list because they cannot pay for the drugs they need to take afterwards...</p>]]></description>
