Biden, was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisjollyhale/status/1156753423309713408"&gt;an op-ed arguing against a tax credit that would help families pay for child care&lt;/a&gt;. Biden, then a senator representing Delaware, made the case that by encouraging more high-earning parents to send their kids to day care, such a tax credit would, among other things, lead to “the deterioration of the family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the debate stage, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/gillibrand-biden-women/595264/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Gillibrand insisted&lt;/a&gt; that this was evidence of Biden’s opposition to working mothers; Biden defended himself by focusing on his fiscal objections to the tax credit and by pointing to his own political record when it comes to women (which, coincidentally, Gillibrand has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenGillibrand/status/783455220768600068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;previously praised&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the document in question is a strange one—a perplexing collection of roughly 600 words that veers from fiscal critique to moral outcry, and pulls off on the side of the argumentative road to bemoan “the cancer of materialism” that convinces Americans that they need to send their kids to day care so that they can work more and buy more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 years after its publication, the op-ed is a bit hard to parse. What precisely did Biden mean when he asserted that it was a lapse of “personal responsibility” for couples to send their kids to day care so that they could both go to work? Was he talking about the shortcomings of working women, or of American parents in general? Biden’s op-ed could be interpreted in multiple ways, but situating it in the context of the early 1980s can shed some light on what he might have been trying to say, and what his blind spots were at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the headline, as Gillibrand did: “Congress Is Subsidizing Deterioration of Family.” That headline, like the rest of the piece, makes no mention of women or mothers—just of parents and the family unit. The wording of a sentence about “evad[ing] personal responsibility” refers to “a couple,” not “a mother.” Elsewhere, he speaks broadly of “Americans—especially members of my generation.” The responsibility-dodging parent is, in the op-ed, left ungendered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden did clarify, in &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-child-care-tax-credit_n_5d39fc3be4b004b6adbcee1f"&gt;comments to a newspaper reporter at the time&lt;/a&gt;, that he didn’t “care whether in a modern marriage you want the man or the woman to take that responsibility. That has to be resolved by each couple individually.” Which suggests that his omission of the words &lt;em&gt;mother &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;women&lt;/em&gt; in the op-ed was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems like the implication, in 1981, would have been assumed to be that the responsibility of looking after kids fell to mothers. The percentage of women who worked had &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2017/women-in-the-workforce-before-during-and-after-the-great-recession/pdf/women-in-the-workforce-before-during-and-after-the-great-recession.pdf"&gt;risen steadily in the preceding decades&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s not hard to read Biden as accusing them of abandoning their domestic post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I talked about the op-ed with Elise Chor, a political-science professor at Temple University who studies early-childhood education, she said she couldn’t tell whether Biden was being “pretty careful not to say ‘women,’” or whether he figured a reader at the time would have taken it as “an implicit assumption” that women were at fault. But of his clarifying comments to the newspaper reporter, she said, “At least he was thinking about [the issue of gender], which was probably a lot more than other people at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/campaign-funds-child-care-fec/594943/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The job of campaigning is extremely family-unfriendly&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also noted, however, that if he did have women in mind when he wrote the article, “it didn’t seem to quite occur to him that women might want to work to have a sense of achievement. But that being said, I don’t think this is a particularly odd [attitude], especially given the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden is probably the only person who can truly settle the question of what he meant, and my requests to his campaign for more information went unanswered. Meanwhile, Meredith Kelly, Gillibrand’s spokesperson, wrote to me in an email,“It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to read between the lines and understand which parent was most likely to stay out of the workplace in 1981—and even today—if affordable childcare isn’t available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting aside the issue of gender for a moment, Biden does separately make an interesting—in the sense that it is not often heard today—argument that American families should look after their own instead of paying others to do so for them. “The day-care centers and nursing homes blossoming across the American landscape are monuments to our growing unwillingness to accept personal responsibility for those to whom we owe the most—our children, our parents and our grandparents,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/normalize-parenthood-workplace-dont-hide-it/589822/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Emily Oster: End the plague of secret parenting&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this position makes more sense given the state of research on child care in the 1980s, according to Terri Sabol, a professor of human development and social policy at Northwestern University. “Right now, we sort of take it as a given that high-quality early-childhood education is good for children,” Sabol told me. “But … it wasn’t until the ’90s and early 2000s that we began to get to the rigorous evidence suggesting that child care is not only not bad for kids, but can be good for kids.” So that stance, Sabol said, “wasn’t out of left field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chor agreed that Biden’s op-ed in many ways is the product of its era. “But,” she said, “I wouldn’t say that we’ve completely changed how we view women’s place in the labor market, especially mothers’ place in the labor market. It’s just that it’s sometimes not vocalized [now].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Biden’s op-ed is vague on who should care for whom. It’s not clear, reading his article now, whether he thinks the responsibility to look after kin should fall equally on men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In truth, American society still hasn’t come to a consensus on this. “That was a long time ago,” was how Biden explained his op-ed to Gillibrand during the debate. It was a long time ago, and it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/QXrDAq68T4g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Pinsker</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/joe-pinsker/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTX71R75-1/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Lucas Jackson / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">About That Joe Biden Op-Ed From 1981</title><published>2019-08-01T16:26:53-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T16:57:36-04:00</updated><summary type="html">During the debates, Kirsten Gillibrand accused the former vice president of disparaging working women.

He was present at the post-World War II creation of a brand of boffo showmanship that came to dominate Broadway in the days when Broadway was still a dominant force—in some ways, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; dominant force—in American popular music and culture. Prince prevailed through changing tastes and times—the rise of rock and roll and the counterculture—and helped pioneer the creation of the “concept musical,” in which plot and character are subordinate to style or theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when he died at 91 on Wednesday in Iceland, Prince could claim more Tony Awards (21) than any other creator or producer, and bragging rights as the original director of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s &lt;em&gt;Phantom of the Opera&lt;/em&gt;, the longest-running musical in Broadway history. (It’s still sounding its “Music of the Night” in eight shows a week at the Majestic Theatre, 31 years after it opened on January 26, 1988.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shows Prince directed and produced, and that his longtime friend Stephen Sondheim wrote (including &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Follies, A Little Night Music &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sweeney Todd&lt;/em&gt;), are now regarded as canonical classics, though not all of them turned a profit in their day. His first collaboration with Sondheim (and Leonard Bernstein), &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt;, which Prince co-produced in 1957, lost the 1958 Tony for best musical to &lt;em&gt;The Music Man&lt;/em&gt;, a lesser work. &lt;em&gt;West Side Story&lt;/em&gt; became a widespread smash only after the popularity of the 1961 film version and its record-breaking soundtrack album, which spent 54 weeks at No. 1 on the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7271910/happy-birthday-billboard-200-chart-album"&gt;Billboard 200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all his commercial and artistic triumphs, Prince was deeply philosophical about the vagaries of success in the theater. “Until recently, I tended to think of &lt;em&gt;She Loves Me &lt;/em&gt;as a flop – because it lost money,” he wrote of the 1963 show, now widely seen as a perfect jewel, in his 2017 memoir &lt;em&gt;Sense of Occasion&lt;/em&gt;. “But a work is not necessarily measured in its own time properly. Success is not measured at the box office. The chances are, if you work often enough, consistently enough, some of your best work will be underestimated, some of your poorer work will get by. If you work consistently enough, it balances out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Prince’s case, it more than balanced out. He knew the theater from the ground up, getting his start as an office boy for the director George Abbott, fresh out of the University of Pennsylvania. He would later work as a stage manager and producer, before finally branching out into solo directing with &lt;em&gt;She Loves Me&lt;/em&gt;. Abbott was the past master of a fast-paced, wise-cracking, bubbling Broadway style for decades (he lived to be 107). But as Prince matured, he moved into far deeper, darker territory: Nazi Germany, marriage and divorce, the corruption of idealistic youth, the illusions and heartbreak of show business itself. A big reason for that is simple: Stephen Sondheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince’s recollection was that he and Sondheim met at the opening night performance of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s &lt;em&gt;South Pacific&lt;/em&gt; in 1949, introduced by Richard Rodgers’s daughter Mary. Sondheim’s memory placed their first encounter a few years later. But their meeting of minds was indisputable, electric and exciting, like that of the young theatrical collaborators in &lt;em&gt;Merrily We Roll Along&lt;/em&gt;, the 1981 flop that effectively ended their creative partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the characters in &lt;em&gt;Merrily&lt;/em&gt;, Prince and Sondheim were “opening doors.” &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;, the first show they did together with Prince as director in 1970, was an acid but ultimately fatalistic look at the compromises and disappointments of marriage, told in a series of episodic encounters between a 35-year-old bachelor and his married friends.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In a letter to Prince and Sondheim, Rodgers called the show “triumphant,” and concluded, “I think&lt;em&gt; Company&lt;/em&gt; is to cynicism what &lt;em&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt; is to sentimentality ... There’s room for both in the theatre.” The team’s next outing a year later,&lt;em&gt; Follies&lt;/em&gt;, was an elegy for Broadway itself, and the Golden Age of Abbott and Rodgers and Hammerstein that was even then passing from the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet in his own life, Prince was anything but a cynic or a pessimist. “I think maybe his greatest strength was his relentless optimism,” Mana Allen, one of &lt;em&gt;Merrily&lt;/em&gt;’s original cast members, told me via email. She continued:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the corporations took over Broadway, he always held the thought that making good theatre matters, that art can change the world, and [that] everything was possible. You always felt you were going in the right direction because Hal was flying the plane. He took the commercial failure of his projects very hard. He took the failure of &lt;em&gt;Merrily&lt;/em&gt; so hard. He felt he let us down, but we didn’t. We saw him never give up making the show better until it was impossible not to. And he never rested on his laurels nor licked his wounds. He just got to work on the next project the morning after opening night, no matter what the reviews were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says something about Prince’s talent and catholicity that his two biggest collaborators—Sondheim and Lloyd Webber—could hardly have had more different sensibilities. The appeal is fairly obvious: Sondheim stretched Prince’s artistic gifts and Lloyd Webber paid the bills. Prince could make a hit with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted Chapin, the longtime leader of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, who got his start in 1971 as a college-age “go-fer” for Prince on the original Broadway production of &lt;em&gt;Follies&lt;/em&gt;, calls Prince “the definition of a man-of-the-theater.” He told me via email, “His career was extraordinary, as everyone knows, but the fact that he never stopped searching for projects, never stopped thinking about Broadway and world theater, and never stopped encouraging future generations will be a large part of his legacy.” Driven, ambitious and manic in his youth, Prince mellowed as he aged, mentoring younger Broadway artists, including the composer Jason Robert Brown, just as Abbott had mentored him. (Disclosure: I can attest to Prince’s generosity. He contributed an enthusiastic jacket blurb to &lt;em&gt;Something Wonderful&lt;/em&gt;, my 2018 book on Rodgers and Hammerstein).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince’s list of credits as producer, director or both amounts to a history of modern Broadway: &lt;em&gt;The Pajama Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Damn Yankees, Fiddler on the Roof, Cabaret, Evita, Kiss of the Spider Woman&lt;/em&gt;. The performances he shepherded are indelible: Just think of Joel Grey’s in &lt;em&gt;Cabaret&lt;/em&gt;, Elaine Stritch’s in &lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;, Angela Lansbury’s in &lt;em&gt;Sweeney Todd&lt;/em&gt;. In 1994, he directed an acclaimed re-interpretation of &lt;em&gt;Show Boat&lt;/em&gt;, the 1927 Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II show that was the progenitor of the serious musical play. “He tossed aside his disinterest in revivals to create a modern way to experience the ‘grand old man’ of musical theater for modern times,” Chapin wrote to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Prince of Broadway&lt;/em&gt;, the long-germinating revue of Prince’s work that opened in New York to disappointing reviews in 2017, was not the ideal valedictory, Prince remained active in his Rockefeller Center offices as he passed his 90th birthday, consulting on projects and checking in on productions of his shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his long collaboration with Sondheim, Prince wrote in his memoir: “I never knew what I might say that would spark something in Steve, and that uncertainty was always stimulating. He writes in pencil—with an eraser. He doesn’t want to commit. I write in ink: I always like to think ‘this is final.’ Steve’s instinct is to keep challenging, and my instinct is to hope I solved it right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How lucky for the rest of us that they both kept at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/RCq9UJI3Pgk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Todd S.

It originated somewhere in Asia about 6,000 years ago, when a cell in the genitals of an unknown dog developed mutations that allowed it to multiply uncontrollably. That is, it became a tumor. But unlike almost every other cancer, which ultimately goes down with its host, this one did not. Somehow, it gained the ability to spread from one dog to another through sexual contact. And in doing so, it achieved a kind of immortality. The original dog is long gone, but its contagious cancer—known as canine transmissible venereal tumor, or CTVT—lives on, having hopped around the world on the junk of humanity’s best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To clarify, several cancers can be caused by infectious entities; cervical cancer, for example, is the work of HPV, a sexually transmitted virus. But in those cases, the cancer itself is not infectious and cannot spread. CTVT is different: Each cancer cell is a free-living parasite that can set up another tumor on another dog. Among wild animals, there are only eight known examples of such transmissible tumors. Two grow on the faces of the unlucky Tasmanian devils. Five spread between shellfish. None are as ancient, prolific, or successful as CTVT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team led by Elizabeth Murchison of the University of Cambridge has finished the largest study of CTVT yet, comparing the DNA of 546 tumors collected from dogs around the world. The team’s study reads like an epic biography of this unusual cancer, and it shows just how strange an entity CTVT really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/domestication-gave-dogs-two-new-eye-muscles/591868/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Why do dogs look so sad?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a typical tumor grows, it also evolves. New cells inherit the mutations of their parents, before picking up new ones of their own. This process of constant change means that cells at opposite ends of a tumor can be genetically different, as can those that spread (or metastasize) to other organs. By comparing these patterns of mutations and working backwards, scientists can identify which mutations arose when and where, and work out how a tumor originated, evolved, and spread. But they usually do this for samples collected from a single body. Murchison’s team did it for samples collected from six continents. “We mapped out a metastasis on a global scale, over thousands of years,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Her team calculated that CTVT arose 4,000 to 8,500 years ago, somewhere in Central Asia. It then stayed there for millennia, perhaps because it emerged in a population of dogs that were isolated from others. For whatever reason, that seclusion broke about 1,900 years ago, and the tumor slowly spread west through Asia to Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its movements accelerated about 500 years ago, when it hitched a ride to the Americas on the genitals of colonizers’ dogs and spread quickly once it arrived. In the 18th century, one particular lineage of CTVT made the return trip, and swept through Europe and Africa. Most of today’s CTVT tumors are descended from that American lineage. Colonization, globalization, and homogenization: The recent history of CTVT is not unlike our own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The tumor’s genes reveal not just the route of its travels, but also some of its encounters along the way. Many carcinogens mutate DNA in distinctive ways: Sunlight, for example, creates a very different pattern of mutations than cigarette smoke. Murchison’s team found that CTVT contains a lot of those sunlight signatures, especially at lower latitudes, where the sun is stronger. For example, CTVT in Mauritius has more sunlight-induced mutations than the same tumor in Russia. Based on that trend, the team could calculate how many sunlight-related mutations the original CTVT tumors would have had and, from that, the latitude at which the founder dog probably lived. “It points to China as a likely origin,” Murchison says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But one pattern of mutations was less clear-cut. Repeatedly, the team saw stretches of DNA where one particular quintet—GTCCA—had changed into GTTCA. (DNA is a chain of four building blocks that can be represented by the letters &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.) And that pattern has never been seen before, in any other cancer, from any other species. Weirder still, that signature accounted for a third of CTVT’s mutations during its early past, but hasn’t cropped up again in the past two millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very mysterious,” Murchison says. “This cancer was exposed to something that caused this very particular mutation, and has never been seen in any human cancer ever, and that seems to have stopped 2,000 years ago. We don’t know what that carcinogen is, and we’d love to. I guess it was probably something in the dogs’ environment? This is a very crazy idea and we don’t really believe it, but maybe ancient people who owned the dogs tried to treat [their tumors] with some kind of chemical?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/dog-neutering-health-risks-for-certain-breeds/594355/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The quietly changing consensus on neutering dogs&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the source of CTVT’s mutations, it has clearly accumulated a lot of them. Put it this way: Today’s tumors are about as genetically different from the founder dog as two distantly related dogs are to each other. “CTVT is like its own organism,” Murchison says. “It isn’t really a dog. Is it a cancer, still?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There’s good reason to think that the answer is no. Sure, it’s a tumor, but one that behaves in very strange ways. For example, one of the hallmarks of cancer is genomic instability. That is, it is constantly mutating, duplicating or deleting genes, rearranging entire chromosomes. To look at a cancer genome is to stare at chaos. CTVT, by contrast, is a picture of stability. Yes, it has a lot of mutations, but that’s because it’s been around for thousands of years. If anything, it acquires new ones at a slower rate than you’d expect for a cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Also, the majority of those mutations, including almost all of the recent ones, are neutral. They don’t seem to benefit the tumor in any way. Again, that’s very different from most cancers, which are constantly adapting to outfox their hosts’ immune systems, or to grow a little faster, or to spread to new areas. Not so with CTVT. “We think that the cancer is not adapting anymore,” says Adrian Baez-Ortega, who was one of the main researchers on the study. “Maybe it doesn’t really need to.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps, early on in CTVT’s history, it found such thorough ways of escaping the immune system and jumping into new hosts that no further tweaks were necessary. Or perhaps it no longer imposes enough harm on its hosts to warrant a counterattack. It’s rarely fatal, after all, and if dogs are otherwise healthy, it doesn’t grow very fast. “The tumor and the dogs aren’t competing against each other anymore,” Baez-Ortega says. “They’re coexisting. The cells behave like cancer cells, but the ecology of the tumor is that of a parasite.” And a fairly benign one at that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Doctors should take note. In lieu of aggressive chemotherapy, which drives the evolution of resistant and recurrent tumors, some researchers are looking at a strategy called adaptive therapy. Their plan is to treat cancers intermittently and gently, enough to control them, but not enough to trigger the rise of resistance. The goal is not to cure, but to tame—to turn a tumor into a long-term but manageable problem. And CTVT shows that “a tumor can be tamed by evolution,” Baez-Ortega says. It can evolve toward low-key survival instead of aggressive growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its future is uncertain, though. While failing to acquire beneficial mutations, CTVT is also failing to weed out harmful ones. That’s understandable, because much of its DNA comprises genes for building a dog. It can afford to let those mutate into obsolescence. But over time, the genes that it still needs will also take hits. Slowly, the tumor will become weaker and less efficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Evolutionary biologists have long predicted that purely asexual organisms—those that reproduce by cloning themselves instead of having sex—are doomed to this fate, which is why they’re incredibly rare. CTVT seems to be proving them right. “Is it an evolutionary dead end?” wonders Hannah Siddle of the University of Southampton, who studies contagious cancers. “Is it gradually becoming more unstable under its increasing random mutational burden?” Baez-Ortega thinks so: “I don’t see this surviving for millions of years,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Humans have sped up the tumor’s demise by treating it with chemotherapy—a surprisingly easy feat because, unlike most cancers, it doesn’t seem to evolve resistance to drugs. Indeed, almost all the 546 dogs sampled in Murchison’s study were cured, even when their tumors had metastasized. “That’s astounding,” she says. “CTVT is probably one of the most curable cancers we know of.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I wonder, when we talk about cure, do we really mean extinction? CTVT is a unique biological entity—not quite a cancer, not quite a dog, and not quite like anything else. There’s a growing movement to protect unglamorous parasites alongside more charismatic fauna. Is CTVT, with genetic collapse on its horizon, a case for conservation instead of cure? Would anyone seriously propose saving a tumor?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“I think you could make that argument, but not at the expense of dogs’ welfare,” Murchison says. “They do recover, but chemotherapy is not nice. I wouldn’t personally be concerned if CTVT was eradicated from the dog population, but if it was kept in a museum, that would be ideal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“It would be very sad if it disappeared from the planet,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/ZsFMSABHxDg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ed Yong</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_597243451/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jules Clark / Getty</media:credit><media:description>Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumor, a contagious cancer, first developed thousands of years ago.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Thousands of Years Ago, a Dog Gave Rise to an Immortal Entity</title><published>2019-08-01T14:02:43-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T15:06:05-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The story of CTVT—a contagious cancer that spreads from dog to dog—gets weirder all the time.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ZsFMSABHxDg/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/ctvt-tumor-broke-all-rules/595246/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595204</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the past three weeks, Donald Trump has alleged that Al Sharpton “hates Whites &amp;amp; Cops.” He’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/7/29/20746188/donald-trump-elijah-cummings-baltimore-rat-infested-racism"&gt;called Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, a majority-black city, a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,” and he’s attacked one of the city’s congressmen, Elijah Cummings. He’s sent racist tweets telling four congresswomen of color to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/send-her-back-trump-supporters-his-nc-rally/594268/?utm_source=feed"&gt;“go back”&lt;/a&gt; to the countries they came from. But for much of the first night of the Democratic debates this week, the president’s most recent stoking of the racial divide barely seemed to register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The glaring lack of racial diversity onstage Tuesday was a product of chance: The current field is the most diverse in history, and each candidate of color in the race was randomly chosen to appear the next evening. That may be one reason for the dearth of discussion about Trump’s recent comments, even though it was the first opportunity for candidates to challenge them in front of a national audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last night, however, the Democrats wasted no time calling out the president. The first debate roiled on for roughly an hour and 40 minutes before candidates began to meaningfully discuss issues of race. It took the second batch of candidates mere minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Donald Trump—from Charleston to Baltimore to the border—is using the tired, old language of demagogues, of fearmongers and racists, to divide our country against itself,” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said during his opening statement. “Mr. President, this is America,” former Vice President Joe Biden said at the close of his own opening remarks. “And we are stronger and great because of this diversity, Mr. President, not in spite of it … We love it. We are not leaving it. We are here to stay, and we're certainly not going to leave it to you.” Both statements were deliberate references to the chants of “Send her back!” that recently overtook a Trump rally, following the president’s attacks on Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/02/racial-divisions-exist-among-whites-blacks-and-hispanics/583267/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The racial divide is the political guide.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Across both evenings, the candidates competed to demonstrate their capability of defeating Trump and the racial animus he’s fanned so far in the 2020 election. One way that struggle revealed itself was in how straightforwardly the candidates talked about racial injustice and the legacy of slavery—and in how they failed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The first night, the 10 white candidates had substantive policy discussions on subjects such as health care and immigration, but they largely treated the task of addressing America’s racial divide as an aside. When directly asked about race in America, they by and large delivered answers that seemed divorced from the current moment. Though some of the candidates acknowledged Trump’s recent attacks, many leaned on time-worn platitudes about embracing the country’s differences, and pivoted to the same policy prescriptions they may have offered months ago, before the president ratcheted up his targeting of prominent people of color. Asked about white supremacy, for example, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts shifted quickly to her plans for free college and canceling student-loan debt. Asked about criticism of his handling of racial inequality in South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said his community is moving “from hurting to healing” after a police shooting, before highlighting his Douglass Plan, released early last month, which is aimed at tackling racial disparities nationally. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, responding to a question about the motivations of Trump voters, argued that “there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren't racist; they just wanted a better shake in the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One notable exception was a major moment from the author Marianne Williamson. After former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas brought up the subject of reparations, she described her plan to pay $200 billion to $500 billion to the descendants of slaves. Referring to reparations as “a debt that is owed” to black America, Williamson argued that anything “less than $100 billion is an insult.” Her response was effective on two fronts: in its specificity—she explained, in real time, how she’d come up with the sum, based on “40 acres and a mule.” And in its emotion—she framed reparations as the ultimate redress for the sin of slavery. “We need to recognize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with,” Williamson said. “That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery was followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last night, concern about race relations and inequities infused much of the conversation, with the candidates forcefully condemning Trump from the start and carrying out detailed policy debates on race-related issues. Like the first group of candidates, they offered a healthy dose of calls for America to mend its divisions, but they also worked to draw distinctions among themselves on proposals that would address past and present racial injustice. In total, they spent almost 30 minutes discussing race-related issues—more than double the time spent during night one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/new-litmus-test-2020-racial-wealth-gap/579823/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The racial wealth gap could become a 2020 litmus test.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Biden and Booker traded jabs about their records on criminal justice, with the former vice president challenging Booker’s stewardship of the Newark Police Department and the New Jersey senator calling out Biden for his championing of the controversial 1994 crime bill. Several candidates referenced Eric Garner, the unarmed black man choked to death by New York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in 2014, while discussing their plans for police accountability, and more than one candidate questioned New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio about his response to the officer skirting charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senator Kamala Harris of California was notably quiet for much of that discussion. But a moderator brought her into the fold by reigniting the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/06/kamala-harris-and-joe-biden-exchange-race-and-bussing/592921/?utm_source=feed"&gt;argument about federally mandated busing&lt;/a&gt; that she and Biden had in their previous debate—the most memorable discussion of race in that June round. Referring to the segregationist senators Biden once boasted about working with, Harris said: “Had those segregationists had their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate, Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate, and Barack Obama would not have been in a position to nominate [Biden] to the title he now holds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii did not let Harris’s silence during the criminal-justice conversation go unnoticed. “She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,” Gabbard said, referencing Harris’s career as a prosecutor and California attorney general. “She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California, and she fought to keep a cash-bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.” Harris responded that she’s proud of the work she’s done—“not just [giving] fancy speeches or [being] in a legislative body and [giving] speeches on the floor,” but working to reform California’s justice system. Gabbard’s rejoinder: “When you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people's lives, you did not … You owe them an apology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Other candidates engaged, too, in their own ways. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York offered to connect with suburban white women voters and to explain to them white privilege, how if “their son is walking down the street wearing a hoodie, his whiteness protects him from not being shot.” And Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado noted that “you can draw a straight line from slavery through Jim Crow through the banking and the redlining to the mass incarceration,” before arguing that the answer to the prison crisis might be fixing America’s schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Though it’s easy to see some of last night’s debate as a bevy of opportunistic attacks, the conversation on the whole telegraphed something meaningful about how candidates are prioritizing racial inequality. And with Trump showing no signs of letting up his racist attacks, the challenge for each of them is clear. Many Americans, especially voters of color, will expect them to strike a delicate balance: between acknowledging institutional racism within the framework of their own ideas, appropriately engaging with Trump’s bigotry in real time, and inspiring the country to imagine life beyond his presidency. Fortunately for them, they have six more weeks to practice until the next debates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Js6e76alY68" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Adrienne Green</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/adrienne-green/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/DEBATERACE/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Arsh Raziuddin / The Atlantic / Carlos Osorio / Charlie Neibergall / Joe Buglewicz / AP / Thos Robinson / Michael Kovac / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Two Nights, Two Very Different Ways of Talking About Race</title><published>2019-08-01T12:59:56-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T14:07:03-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The Democratic candidates who debated yesterday wasted no time in confronting President Trump about his racist attacks.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Js6e76alY68/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/democratic-debates-race-busing-trump-racist-tweets/595204/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595318</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Waterbury School District is quarantined within man-made, invisible walls, partitions that hug it on each side, forming taut, if unnatural, boundaries on the map. The school district, in Waterbury, Connecticut, is touched by eight other districts, each one whiter, more affluent, and receiving more dollars than Waterbury itself. Take the Wolcott School District, for example, where 87 percent of students are white, and which spends $2,000 more per student than Waterbury, which is 82 percent nonwhite; or the Plymouth School District, which has a racial makeup that’s comparable to Wolcott’s, and which spends $3,500 more per student. More wealth, more white students, more resources for those kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterbury is surrounded by what EdBuild, a nonprofit focused on equity in school funding, calls an isolating border; the group defines an isolating border as one that divides one school district from another that is at least 25 percent whiter and receives at least 10 percent more funding per student. What’s happening in Waterbury is not unique. Across the United States, in 42 states, there are 969 of these isolating borders, according to EdBuild’s &lt;a href="https://edbuild.org/content/dismissed"&gt;recently released report&lt;/a&gt;. The average disparity in funding along these borders was roughly $4,000 per student. Waterbury, the group found, is the most isolated school district in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterbury’s predicament points to an unstable aspect of the public-education system in the United States: The foundation of its funding comes from local property taxes. As a report from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy shows, &lt;a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/future-us-public-school-revenue-policy-brief_0.pdf"&gt;roughly 36 percent of K–12 funding&lt;/a&gt; comes from these taxes. That means inequality is often baked into district lines; wealthier communities will have more money to spend on their students. It’s an often mentioned but under-discussed problem, particularly among the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Senator Kamala Harris of California &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/05/kamala-harris-america-needs-fix-public-k-12-funding/589207/?utm_source=feed"&gt;took aim at the disparity&lt;/a&gt;. “It is completely upside down that we currently have a system where the funding of a school district is based on the tax base of that community,” she said during a town hall with the American Federation of Teachers. In March, it was Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who wanted to take a more national approach to fixing it. “We’ve gotta use our federal education laws to help supplement [local funding] so we can get real money into our public schools K–12,” Warren said. And as part of his Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public Education, the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont writes that he will “rethink the link between property taxes and education funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rethinking that link is important, Rebecca Sibilia, the executive director of EdBuild, told me, because micro-districting—the term for what is happening in Waterbury and elsewhere—handcuffs some of the tools the government might use to desegregate schools. In 1974, in the Supreme Court case &lt;em&gt;Milliken v. Bradley&lt;/em&gt;, the justices ruled that desegregation plans could not leapfrog school-district borders. That means the federal government could shuffle children between schools only in the same district in places like Waterbury. Interestingly, even as Democrats argued over the utility of busing as a method of desegregation during the first two rounds of debates, school funding only tangentially came up as a remedy. “We are still upholding a school system that is separate and unequal,” Sibilia told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A browse through other 2020 Democratic contenders’ websites does not turn up much when it comes to addressing the link between property taxes and public schools. And when I reached out to several campaigns—including those of Harris, Sanders, Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg—only Castro’s campaign responded with details about how he might address the gap. A spokesman for his campaign told me that his education plan would provide “full Title I funding that would direct federal investment into low-income and high-poverty communities that are often [under-resourced] at the local level, often as a consequence of how property taxes are structured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several candidates, for their part, have argued for increased funding for Title I, which provides federal grants aimed at helping students in low-income schools. But putting more money into Title I doesn’t fundamentally reform the funding disparities; school districts that are able to raise significant money from property taxes could still have an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibilia offered a possible solution. States could address the funding disparity by tweaking how property taxes are distributed. Perhaps all property taxes could get pooled within a county and then evenly distributed across districts—after all, there are about 4.5&lt;a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_098.asp"&gt; times&lt;/a&gt; as many school districts in the country than there are counties. Or maybe the tax dollars could be pooled statewide; then, regardless of where students lived in that state, they would receive the same amount of resources for their education. The federal government, she said, could incentivize states to pursue these tweaks with funding matches. It might be a long shot, but it could work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic presidential debates, when they have turned to education, have so far focused on busing, college affordability, and school safety. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/07/harris-biden-bennet-school-segregation-busing/595261/?utm_content=edit-promo&amp;amp;utm_term=2019-08-01T02%3A45%3A58&amp;amp;utm_source=feed&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic"&gt;veered away from busing&lt;/a&gt; to talk about modern segregation during the second slate of debates, but only for a moment. But the schools trapped within these isolating, segregating borders will require more sweeping solutions to break free of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/cac1AMTM9iI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Adam Harris</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/adam-harris/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_982189722/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Karl Tapales / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Whiter, Richer School District Right Next Door</title><published>2019-08-01T12:58:55-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T14:37:14-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Public schools’ dependence on local property taxes means some districts get isolated from the financial resources in their communities.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/cac1AMTM9iI/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/08/segregated-school-districts-trapped-their-borders/595318/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595219</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After two nights of spirited debate in Detroit, many Democrats may be feeling anxious: Their 2020 front-runner didn’t entirely mollify concerns about his political skills, and his three major rivals positioned themselves in ways that could leave the party vulnerable in the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden, under fire from virtually every other candidate on the stage, delivered a more vigorous performance at last night’s debate than he did in Miami in June. With only a few exceptions, Biden also held to his moderate positioning on the major issues dividing the field. But he served up enough rhetorical stumbles and moments of stammering uncertainty to sustain the concerns of those who worry about his capacity to handle a demanding general-election campaign against Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, over the two debate nights, the three candidates closest to Biden in the polls—Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Kamala Harris of California—reaffirmed their commitment to progressive positions, on issues from health care to immigration, that surveys show face opposition from a clear majority of Americans. The general consensus among most observers was that Warren turned in the most assured and energetic performance of any heavyweight over the two nights. But she did that in the service of ideas, such as decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings and eliminating private health insurance, &lt;a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1907190926.pdf#page=3"&gt;that polls show&lt;/a&gt; face broad resistance from the overall electorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that way, these debates may have underscored the structural imbalance at the center of the race: Warren, Harris, and Sanders are aiming their agendas primarily at the same group of liberal voters—many of them younger—while the former vice president has much less competition for more centrist and older Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden’s mixed performance yesterday highlighted his potential vulnerability, but the staunchly liberal positions that his principal rivals advanced during the debates could limit their ability to cut into the constituencies that have provided his lead: older and moderate whites, as well as African Americans, who tend to be more moderate than is commonly assumed. While the attacks on Biden from his left could further erode his position with the party’s progressive wing, his rivals may have simultaneously painted themselves more deeply into an ideological corner that constrains their capacity to grow among more centrist Democratic voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/cory-booker-democratic-debate-biden-criminal-justice/595255/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Cory Booker exposed a key Biden weakness&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2016 race, voters who identified as “very liberal” were the only ideological group in which Sanders ran evenly with Hillary Clinton. But they represented only about one-fourth of all primary voters, according to a cumulative analysis of 2016 exit polls by CNN. Voters who identified as “somewhat liberal” (just over one-third) or “moderate and conservative” (about two-fifths) cast a larger share of the vote. Likewise, voters over age 45 cast fully 60 percent of all primary votes in 2016, compared with about one-sixth for voters under 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, Biden could face competition for moderate and older voters from the other centrists in the field. But none of them have yet consolidated much support. And while some of the moderate candidates performed well over the two nights—particularly Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Montana Governor Steve Bullock—none of them had a breakout moment likely to dramatically improve their position. Meanwhile, several of the relative moderates, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, delivered low-wattage performances that may further hurt their standing in the polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So did former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who appears determined to try to bridge the party’s ideological divide. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who’s also aiming to span those differences, was, as always, crisp and articulate—but he also lacked a defining moment likely to raise his support, which has slipped well behind the top four heavyweights. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro delivered strong performances last night, but both are positioned well to Biden’s left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debates ended as they began, with no top-tier moderate alternative to Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former vice president used the debate to underscore his moderate positioning, even if that dynamic was frequently obscured by the crossfire of attacks he faced from rivals across the stage. Biden strongly made the case against a single-payer health-care plan that would eliminate private health insurance and instead argued for expanding the Affordable Care Act by creating a public option. He opposed treating unauthorized border crossings as a civil, rather than criminal, offense, and he said he would reopen negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership rather than scrap it entirely, as many on the left prefer. Compared with other Democrats, he took a relatively more restrained position on climate by indicating he wanted the economy to become carbon-neutral by 2050, well beyond the 2030 date specified in the Green New Deal. (Although it didn’t come up yesterday, his campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/2020-democrats-undocumented-health-care/593761/?utm_source=feed"&gt;clarified after the first debate&lt;/a&gt; that he would allow undocumented immigrants to purchase health insurance through the ACA with their own money, but would not provide them any public subsidies to do so.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As last night’s debate showed, Biden has moved left on some issues since announcing his candidacy: He made clear that he has renounced his earlier support for mandatory-minimum sentences, the death penalty, and the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions. But with those exceptions, Biden took pains to plant himself toward the moderate end of the party on most issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/biden-harris-attack/595210/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Joe Biden enters attack mode&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That created an especially stark contrast with his three principal rivals, who solidified their left-wing bona fides. Over the two nights, Harris, Warren, and Sanders all called for decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings. Harris endorsed the highly ambitious goal of decarbonizing the economy by 2030. Warren and Sanders were unwavering in their desire to eliminate private health insurance as part of a move to a single-payer system. And while Harris distanced herself from that position this week by &lt;a href="https://kamalaharris.org/medicare-for-all/"&gt;releasing a health-care plan&lt;/a&gt; that would maintain a role for private insurers, Biden sharply criticized her plan over its cost and elimination of employer-based insurance coverage. Warren, Sanders, and Harris have also indicated they would allow undocumented immigrants full access to health benefits under their plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1907190926.pdf#page=3"&gt;A recent NPR/PBS &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1907190926.pdf#page=3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NewsHour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1907190926.pdf#page=3"&gt;/Marist College poll&lt;/a&gt; underscores the challenge Democrats may face selling many of those ideas. In that survey, 54 percent of Americans opposed eliminating private insurance; 62 percent opposed covering the undocumented in any national health-care system; and 66 percent opposed decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even among Democrats who identified as moderate or conservative, nearly half opposed covering the undocumented, and a clear majority opposed decriminalizing border crossings, according to detailed results provided to &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;by Marist. A solid majority of those more moderate Democrats also rejected ending the death penalty, which every major Democratic contender has now embraced. In the survey, a national health-care system that eliminates private insurance did register support from a clear majority of both liberal Democrats and moderates. But, for Democrats primarily concerned about electability, the overall public’s opposition to that idea may still make them hesitant about supporting a candidate who advocates for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the determination of Biden’s main rivals this week to double down on positions that face such broad public resistance could solidify his principal asset in the race: the belief, especially among older and more moderate Democrats, that he would represent the strongest nominee against Trump (many of whose own positions faced majority opposition in the NPR/PBS/&lt;em&gt;Newshour&lt;/em&gt;/Marist survey).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3635"&gt;In a &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3635"&gt;Quinnipiac University poll released this week&lt;/a&gt;, 51 percent of likely Democratic-primary voters nationwide said Biden presented the party’s best chance against Trump—Sanders (at 10 percent) and Warren and Harris (both at 8 percent) all distantly trailed. Biden held a comfortable lead on that question over his rivals, even among voters younger than 50, but his advantage swelled among older Democrats: He is leading the next closest candidate by a factor of 10 among those 65 and older. Among Democrats who identified as moderate to conservative, more than six times as many picked Biden as the strongest candidate compared with any other contender. Among black voters, he led by a factor of 9, drawing 57 percent on that question, compared with Harris’s 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Biden’s &lt;em&gt;positioning&lt;/em&gt; at last night’s debate buttresses his advantage on electability, it seems unlikely that his &lt;em&gt;performance &lt;/em&gt;will do so. He displayed much more energy and fight than he did during the first debate, forcefully delivering well-rehearsed attacks on his rivals. But he also misspoke at several junctures (in his closing statement, he bungled a call for viewers to visit his website), frequently became tangled in his answers, and got so lost in the weeds of responding to the many attacks directed his way that, after his opening statement, he almost completely failed to communicate the larger themes animating his campaign or explain his goals as president. Biden survived, but few would likely say he thrived. “Biden basically stabilized,” Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor who worked with Biden during his stint as Obama’s chief of staff, told me. “I think he was good, not great.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats have been divided over and uncertain of whether the best pathway to beating Trump is to nominate an unapologetic liberal who promises to mobilize minority and younger voters, or a white centrist who might better attract college-educated whites recoiling from Trump and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/trumps-go-back-attacks-white-working-class-women/594805/?utm_source=feed"&gt;working-class white women expressing growing ambivalence about him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week’s debates, by highlighting the weaknesses on both sides of that divide, may only increase the party’s worry about which road is more likely to lead it back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/TlW9NkTL9q4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ronald Brownstein</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ronald-brownstein/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/CandidatesFOrNoraJohn/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Carlos Osorio / Paul Vernon / AP / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Joe Biden Is the Big Winner of the Democrats’ Leftward Shift</title><published>2019-08-01T12:50:45-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T16:05:40-04:00</updated><summary type="html">In the latest debates, Warren, Sanders, and Harris all vied for the party’s progressives rather than testing the front-runner’s support with moderates.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/TlW9NkTL9q4/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/biden-warren-sanders-moderate-voters/595219/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595303</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It started as a good day. As usual, Kevin Langergraber got up at dawn to follow and observe the chimpanzees of Ngogo, in Uganda’s Kibale National Park. An anthropologist from Arizona State University, he has been &lt;a href="http://ngogochimpanzeeproject.org/research/"&gt;studying the group&lt;/a&gt; for 19 summers. This year, food has been scarce, and so have the chimps. But yesterday Langergraber found a group of 30 adults playing and relaxing, with infants crawling all over them. “It was just me and 30 chimps,” he says. “I was so happy. And it just turned so quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, the chimps were on the move, traversing a familiar route between two stretches of forest. Shortly after they reentered the trees, Langergraber, who was right behind them, heard one of them scream. He thought they had stumbled onto a buffalo or an elephant, but when he ran up to them, he was shocked to see two people. Poachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langergraber ran at them, shouting. One angry scientist is hardly a threat, but he could have had more people, or armed rangers, behind him. The poachers fled. Their dogs didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poachers had brought a few dozen hunting dogs. Half of them were mauling a female chimp named Kidman and her 25-day-old infant. Another small pack was tearing at Jumbo, Kidman’s six-year-old son. Langergraber ran up and started kicking the dogs, to no avail. Then he realized that a spear was sticking out of Kidman’s back. He pulled it out and started spearing the dogs attacking Jumbo. The dogs and chimp tumbled down a hill, and Langergraber ran after them. Eventually he had killed or wounded enough of the dogs for Jumbo to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langergraber climbed back up the hill to find Kidman on the ground, bleeding out, still being mauled. Her adult son Elton and his close friend Hicks were trying to chase the dogs away, and Langergraber joined in. Hicks fled with Kidman’s wounded infant. “In the end, it was just me and Elton fighting off dogs,” Langergraber says. They eventually succeeded, but it was too late for Kidman, who died a few minutes later, either from the two spear wounds in her back or from the injuries inflicted by the dogs. Elton went up to her, sniffed her one last time, and fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/can-humans-understand-chimps/536826/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Can humans understand chimpanzees?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been 10 minutes since Langergraber heard the scream, and he was standing there surrounded by seven dead dogs, several wounded ones, a spear covered in both chimp and dog blood, and the body of a chimp he had known for 19 years. “It was just horrible,” Langergraber says. “You know chimps die, but when it happens right before your eyes, it’s so real. And it was hard having to spear all these dogs. I’m a dog lover. But it had to be done.” &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/NgogoChimps/photos/a.360431887334189/2591732864204069/?type=3&amp;amp;theater"&gt;He stayed with Kidman’s body for four hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, Langergraber’s colleagues found Hicks still with Kidman’s infant, carrying it on his stomach as mothers usually do, and as adult males very much don’t. Today the team learned that the infant is dead. Even if it hadn’t been mauled, it likely wouldn’t have survived without its mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="499" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/Kidman_and_infant/6a20329d2.jpg" width="383"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Kidman and her infant, in a photo taken three days ago (Kevin Langergraber / Ngogo Chimpanzee Project)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ngogo community is the largest known group of chimps, and researchers have been studying it—and trying to protect it—since 1995. Kidman, who was 42 and named after the actress Nicole Kidman, was one of the most beloved individuals there. After surviving a recent bout of respiratory illness, she developed a loud wheeze. Perhaps that made her easier to track. Relaxed and good-natured, she showed little fear of people, and would often fall asleep in front of researchers, cuddling her infants. Perhaps that made her easier to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of debate about whether animals grieve, and it’s easy to read human emotions into animal behavior. But it’s equally hard to argue that chimps don’t mourn or feel loss. Mothers have been seen carrying around the &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18818-how-chimps-mourn-their-dead/"&gt;mummified corpses&lt;/a&gt; of babies that died weeks ago. Daughters have been filmed grooming their dying mothers, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/04/chimps-grieve-over-dead-relatives"&gt;and keeping a sort of vigil as they die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Ngogo, a male named Ellington went missing in 2002. He might have been killed by poachers, or even other chimps, but whatever the case, his absence profoundly affected his closest companion, a male named Hare. Once sociable, Hare became withdrawn. He’d show up in big groups, walk around, and quickly depart. John Mitani, who leads the Ngogo Chimpanzee Project, wonders if he was looking for his friend. And Langergraber wonders if the other chimps will react to Kidman’s absence in the same way. “Unless you were one of those 25 chimps that were there, you’d just not see Kidman anymore,” he says. “You’d have no idea why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/we-are-destroying-chimpanzee-cultures/584146/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Chimpanzee traditions are disappearing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the chimps that witnessed the mauling were extremely close to Kidman. Harper, Hicks’s mother, is one of the oldest females in the group, and had been Kidman’s best friend for decades. Elton, Kidman’s son, is of the age when male chimps split off from their mothers, but he still stuck to her. Her other son Jumbo, who was also mauled, is still missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence is an inextricable part of nature, and chimpanzees both suffer from it and inflict it. They murder one another. They wage war. Those at Ngogo hunt red colobus monkeys for food. A civil war is also brewing, as the 200-strong group of chimps is fracturing in two and longtime allies are becoming enemies. A male, Basie, was killed by a former ally just this summer. “It’s tough, but you sort of accept it as natural chimp behavior,” Langergraber says. But the poaching “is just … I don’t know … It feels so much worse. It’s senseless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other parts of Africa, chimps are often killed for bushmeat, but in Uganda, there are local taboos against eating primates. Poachers more often go after bushpigs and forest hogs. But if they come across chimps, they will sometimes kill them and feed them to their dogs. That’s what the duo Langergraber scared away were likely doing. And they got away, too. Anti-poaching squads tracked them for miles, but their sniffer dogs lost the scent after running into a herd of elephants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This probably happens all the time, but this was a story where someone saw it,” Langergraber says. “And it happened to a chimp that people have studied since 1995. We know her family, her history. We have beautiful photos of her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langergraber has run into poachers in the field before, but never in the midst of killing chimps. More often, chimps are caught in snares that the poachers set for antelope and pigs; about a third of Ngogo’s chimps have snare-related injuries. Kibale now has &lt;a href="http://ngogochimpanzeeproject.org/conservation/"&gt;three anti-poaching teams&lt;/a&gt;, including armed rangers from the Uganda Wildlife Authority and snare-removal experts led by “Big James” Tibisimwa. He used to be a poacher himself, but gave up that life when Kibale became a national park. He worked as a cook and cleaner for the Ngogo research project before using his experience to train anti-poaching officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams are skilled and effective, and poaching declines in areas where they work. But they also have to cover 300 square miles of forest and grassland. “It’s a constant battle to &lt;a href="http://ngogochimpanzeeproject.org/how-you-can-help/"&gt;fund these anti-poaching teams&lt;/a&gt;, and we wanted to raise money to hire two more,” Langergraber says. “This has been a good kick in the butt to get that going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/5dIfzh0LNLs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ed Yong</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/Webp.net_resizeimage/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Kevin Langergraber / Ngogo Chimpanzee Project</media:credit><media:description>Kidman, a chimpanzee, now dead</media:description></media:content><title type="html">A Scientist Witnessed Poachers Killing a Chimp</title><published>2019-08-01T12:43:48-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T16:54:40-04:00</updated><summary type="html">When Kevin Langergraber heard a scream in the rain forest, he ran to see what was happening.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/5dIfzh0LNLs/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/death-chimpanzee/595303/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595309</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;As soon as I heard that Quentin Tarantino was making a movie about the Manson killings, I knew I would be there on opening night. As the release date neared, and the ravishing still photography of Andrew Cooper, Tarantino’s regular photographer, began to appear—beginning with a January &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/preview-quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;, which operated like an injection of Narcan on that slumbering magazine—I wondered whether I would be able to make it to July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I knew that the film would not be a biopic in any conventional sense, and that it would explore the sexually louche Hollywood of the late 1960s alongside the sinister element of the once-joyful hippie movement, an element that was hardly in its infancy before it crested in the Manson murders. (“Just in time,” everyone told Joan Didion when she went to San Francisco to report on depravity in the Haight in 1967; “the whole fad’s dead now, fini, kaput.”) And I knew that Sharon Tate—cipher, beauty, Texas pageant girl, and Euro sophisticate—was a character Tarantino could have invented. I assumed that the film would, in the director’s characteristic way, include digressions, set pieces, flights from narrative logic so prolonged they would bring the viewer to points of murderous rage, and that the director would reemerge in the third act, fully in possession of his narrative powers, to stick the landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; is a swoon of a movie. It’s full of so much beauty and menace and humor and intelligence that I couldn’t do anything but sit flattened while it rolled over me. In anyone else’s hands, the long middle section would have walked the room. In Tarantino’s, I just kept watching, helplessly. Eventually that long digression ends and you’re back in business, back in the place of childhood daydreams and nightmares. I was 7 years old when the Manson killings happened, a child up in Berkeley who, like all children at the time, heard words—&lt;em&gt;Manson&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the killings&lt;/em&gt;, something about words written in blood—before radios were switched off and mothers changed the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Every generation has its crime that looms over the children, its details slowly making their way into their nightmares. Leopold and Loeb in the 1920s, the Black Dahlia in the ’40s. For my generation—Tarantino’s generation—the Manson murders were the crime that had the children’s attention. In Berkeley, we lived through Patty Hearst’s kidnapping—which everyone had some small connection to, and which dominated the city’s life—but when it was over, we went right back to Manson. It’s deep in our imagination. The justice critics, the ones who want to count up every movie’s sins against approved sensibilities, say that the film is nostalgic, a term intended to damage it. Only another artist would understand the way that Tarantino has deployed that potent force. Guillermo del Toro tweeted that the movie was “[chock-full] of yearning,” that it was “a tale of another time that probably never was but feels like a memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-box-office-sony-disney/594961/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What Quentin Tarantino’s box-office success says about Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The justice critics aren’t interested in fictions that feel like memories. They want movies that adhere to their vision of the way the world should be. To them, the movie is too white, too violent toward women, and too uninterested in Margot Robbie, whose Sharon Tate has few lines. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s Richard Brody reviled the picture, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/review-quentin-tarantinos-obscenely-regressive-vision-of-the-sixties-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood"&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt; it “ridiculously white.” But Charles Manson was a white supremacist, a fact that does tend to put a lot of white people in a movie. The majority of these white people are drugged-out sadists who live in filth, and scrounge in garbage, entirely repellent. And the Hollywood of the time was a deeply insular place from which progressive values flowed easily, but that never stopped to examine itself as a racially exclusive enterprise. Depicting it as inclusive would give the lie to the decades of hard work that have gone into changing that fact, work that is finally beginning to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As to violence against women, what can I tell you? If you don’t like it, don’t go to a movie about the Manson killings. Say what you will about Charles Manson; he really empowered women to pursue excellence in traditionally male-dominated fields. From armed robbery to sadistic murder at knifepoint, he put women in positions from which they had been traditionally excluded, and ultimately helped them to break that hardest, highest glass ceiling, the one that makes death row such a male purview. The Manson crimes became famous because of the savagery of the killings, the killers became famous because so many of them were women, and the most famous of the victims was a very specific woman, so particularly feminine—and at the height of femininity, the peak of her young beauty, and eight-and-a-half months pregnant—that her slaughter instantly assumed a mythic importance. Moreover, without giving away the ending, for many of us the violent scene that the justice critics hate was something we’ve been waiting 50 years to see. As for me, I closed my eyes during part of it, an option available to any ticket holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sharon Tate doesn’t get many lines, a fact that may not make feminist sense, but which absolutely makes artistic sense. We didn’t know her. All we knew were the facts of her murder and of her impossible beauty. We created her from the endless publicity photographs that would appear and reappear in newspapers throughout our childhoods. She was living in the midst of the ascendant and dangerous new Hollywood, and yet she was also living a very conventional life. Two photographs in particular, both of them shot in the back seat of a limo, came to stand for those things. In one she is wearing a wedding dress and veil, orange blossoms in her hair, her groom beside her. In the other she’s holding up a tiny knit sweater, as though on her way home from a baby shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For a very brief moment it seemed possible to be a sexually free woman of the new era and also to round out that period of freedom with the old, square punctuation points. She was part of the new Hollywood royalty, at the height of the youth movement, and yet she was also a girl living out the dreams of Enid Haupt’s&lt;em&gt; Seventeen&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Because of this, and because of the blunt force of her beauty, she stood for two of the most powerful forces in history: sexuality and femininity. Hence the scenes of her dancing, first at the Playboy mansion and then in the sun-drenched privacy of her bedroom. In truth, even the most beautiful girls of 1968 didn’t spend much time putting on shorts and dancing alone in bedrooms while drenched in the golden light of a California afternoon—but we weren’t interested in sociological observations. We were deep into mythic territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/hr-workplace-harrassment-metoo/590644/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Caitlin Flanagan: The problem with HR&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tate was an interesting person, the daughter of an Army colonel, a pageant winner at six months—Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas—someone who moved regularly because of her father’s job and who was therefore lonely and shy. She went to her senior year of high school at the American School in Italy, already famous in her father’s world because a photograph of her in a bathing suit had been published in &lt;em&gt;Stars and Stripes&lt;/em&gt;. Margot Robbie’s evocation of her as a happy, sexy, beautiful girl who basked in the attention her beauty brought her brings to life exactly the dream girl we loved so fiercely. And Tarantino has paid Tate the ultimate compliment: When Robbie goes to a movie theater to watch herself in one of her few movie roles, he didn’t reshoot that film with the modern actress in the role. We’re watching Margot Robbie watching Sharon Tate, and the half century that separates those two real women looms over the scenes. Why are Robbie’s feet, slipped out of immaculate white go-go boots and slung over a movie seat in front of her, so filthy? That is between Quentin Tarantino and his God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;What’s really got the justice critics worked up, however, isn’t the violence or the nostalgia or the silencing of Sharon Tate. What’s rattling them more than they realize is that this movie is transgressive as hell. Only Tarantino would have the balls to make something like it, something that embraces values that have repeatedly been proved—proved!—to be dangerous, outdated, the thing that people don’t want anymore. Box-office poison. And only Tarantino could do it so skillfully that it’s not until you’re back in the car that you realize what he’s done: made a major motion picture in 2019 about a man with a code, a man who hews to the old values of the Western hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The movie is about Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Rick Dalton. But this is Brad Pitt’s picture, and he carries it so easily that you don’t realize it until the end. Rick is the washed-up star of a TV Western, whose career has wound down to guest-star appearances on other actors’ Westerns (in the career-killing role of villain), heavy drinking, and indulging in fits of crying. He’s weak. Pitt is Cliff Booth, Rick’s stunt double, the one who does all the dangerous things and who—literally—takes no credit. Rick is so dependent on Cliff that he has hired him as driver and houseman, a role that should diminish Cliff in our eyes—1968’s Kato Kaelin—but doesn’t. Cliff is cool, funny, laconic, and tough. His competence and emotional reserve make us more aware of Rick’s weakness. So it’s a depth charge of misgiving to learn that he’s not welcome on some television sets. He brings a bad energy, apparently, because many people believe he killed his wife. It’s an anvil dropping: Is he a threat? Did he do it? In the one flashback, the truth is never revealed. For most of the picture, we know we can’t trust him, and Pitt plays with us throughout, one moment charming, the next lost in something inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At the end of the movie, after he’s redeemed tenfold, we realize who he was all along and why we couldn’t help falling for him—a hero. Rick spent the movie trying to portray a hero; Cliff spent it being one—and like all heroes, he didn’t spend any time bringing attention to the fact. The beautiful teenager who keeps trying to get him to give her a ride finally succeeds, but when she tries to seduce him, she doesn’t have a chance. He spares her feelings by telling her that it’s because she doesn’t have a photo ID to prove she’s over 18, but that’s not the reason. He doesn’t need “affirmative consent.” He has a code: A man doesn’t sleep with teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-movie-review-tarantinos-best-in-years/594535/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Quentin Tarantino has made his best movie in a decade&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Cliff faces great danger at the Manson compound to make sure an elderly man of his slight acquaintance is safe. He doesn’t start fights, but if he gets into one, he’ll lay out the challenger. His dog loves him, he doesn’t like to see a man crying, and he’s got his passions under control. One afternoon, he climbs to Rick’s roof to fix his television antenna, a potent symbol of Rick’s failing television career, but also one more reminder of their relationship: Rick’s things are broken, and Cliff repairs them. In the bright sun, he takes off his shirt (heaven help us) and then he hears music from the house next door. It’s Tate, alone in her room. He glances over—does he see her? Maybe. But he’s not a man who climbs on roofs for a peep show, and he turns back to his work. Most of all, he’s loyal—even when Rick might not deserve that loyalty. In the end, he’s Gary Cooper facing Frank Miller all by himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We can’t have a movie like this. It affirms things the culture wants killed. If men aren’t encouraged to cry in public, where will we end up? And the bottom line is the bottom line: Audiences don’t want to see this kind of thing anymore. The audience wants the kind of movies the justice critics want. But the audience gave &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; the biggest opening of Tarantino’s career. The critics may not get it, but the public does. Is Tarantino making a reactionary statement at a dangerous time? Or does the title tell the truth, that the whole thing—including those old masculine values—was always just a fairy tale, a world “that never really existed, but feels like a memory”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the sexiest scene in the movie, Cliff roars out of Rick’s driveway up in the canyons in his rusted blue Karmann Ghia, Bob Seger blaring—“I was born lonely, down by the riverside”—taking mountain turns at impossible speeds, racing across the old L.A. freeways late at night, bound for Van Nuys and sliding across lanes with ultimate cool. But in a TMZ video clip, you see Pitt surrounded by a large crew, trying to make the easiest part of the journey—the three-point turn out of Rick’s driveway—at about five miles an hour and falling short every time, despite a closed road. Over and over the crew pushes the car back up the driveway, while Pitt sits in it miserably, much more Rick than Cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What’s real? Who knows?

Global warming, he said, could send the world economy spiraling into another 2008-like crisis. He called for central banks to act aggressively and immediately to reduce the risk of climate-related catastrophe, taking the warming planet as seriously as they would a cooling economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Adam Tooze, a history professor at Columbia University, knows quite a bit about central banks—and the Great Recession. Last year he published &lt;em&gt;Crashed&lt;/em&gt;, an award-winning account of the 2008 collapse and its aftermath. In that book, he argues that the U.S. Federal Reserve was the pivotal American institution in stopping a second Great Depression. Its actions were “historically unprecedented, spectacular in scale,” he writes, and widely understood by experts to be the “decisive innovation of the crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/20/why-central-banks-need-to-step-up-on-global-warming/"&gt;in an article this month in &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tooze asserts that the Fed needs to battle climate change in the same way. “If the world is to cope with climate change, policymakers will need to pull every lever at their disposal,” he writes. “Faced with this threat, to indulge in the idea that central banks, as key agencies of the state, can limit themselves to worrying about financial stability … is its own form of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, would not call himself a climate-change denier. Indeed, he is probably the most powerful person in the American government who affirms climate science. Yet he has taken a subdued approach to mitigating climate change. In April, &lt;a href="http://www.schatz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Chair%20Powell%20to%20Sen.%20Schatz%204.18.19.pdf"&gt;in a letter to Senator Brian Schatz&lt;/a&gt;, Powell wrote that “addressing climate change is a responsibility that Congress has entrusted to other agencies.” The Federal Reserve, he added, is using its tools to “prepare financial institutions for severe weather.” In England, by contrast, Carney has convened 33 central banks to investigate &lt;a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en/financial-stability/international-role/network-greening-financial-system/press-events"&gt;how to “green the financial system.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/jerome-powell-fed-federal-reserve-climate-change-5d70a03e-cad4-4983-8426-f054998b0fae.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, every powerful central bank is working with him—except for Banco do Brasil and the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I talked with Tooze last week about whether climate change could really cause another global crash, how to think about climate policy in history, and what the Fed could do to decarbonize the economy. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robinson Meyer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/20/why-central-banks-need-to-step-up-on-global-warming/"&gt;In your &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt;, you draw an analogy between the financial crisis of 2008 and what’s happening now with climate change. You describe a crisis in a near-term future, one where climate change has taken hold but where much of the economy is still tied up in oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I will say: I’m a little skeptical. I’m not sure you could get the kind of sudden financial stop through climate change that you got in 2007 and 2008. What’s the right way to think about that analogy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; That skepticism is perfectly warranted. I’d say that in some sense, I’m here writing with my historian’s hat on, and all I’m really observing is that Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, &lt;a href="https://www.bis.org/review/r151009a.htm"&gt;in 2015, in a speech which has subsequently received massive coverage&lt;/a&gt;—and he is a man, after all, absolutely &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; the global financial establishment—coined the idea of a climate Minsky moment. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/04/the-minsky-moment"&gt;A Minsky moment&lt;/a&gt; is when an asset’s price suddenly collapses after a long period of growth.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So the point, to me, is not so much the realism of that prospect, of the fact that we could have some kind of subprimelike scenario. For me, the significant thing is that the argument is actually going on inside the establishment, in the network of financial regulators and central-bank thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Are we likely to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a financial Minsky moment? I think that is a reasonable question mark. We would need [fossil-fuel assets] to be on the balance sheet of actors who were under huge pressure in a fire-sale situation and who couldn’t deal with a sudden revaluation. We would need an entire network of causation to be there, which is what produced the unique crisis of 2007 to 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: What would cause that kind of sudden revaluation? Would there need to be a policy shock, such as the United States suddenly imposing a climate policy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; That would be one way in which this could be sudden. So imagine that we stay on our current path, and we’re headed toward 3 or 4 degrees’ [Celsius] temperature change. And then imagine some of the nonlinearities kick in, which the climate scientists tell us about, and we face a Fukushima-style event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What happens next? You then get nervous democratic politicians—and not necessarily those who are known for their populism, but just nervous democratic politicians—suddenly deciding that we have to stop doing one or another part of our carbon-based economy. It has to stop, and it has to stop immediately. And then you get big shocks. Then you get sudden revaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That, I think, is the sort of scenario that the Bank of England people are working with. In other words, the success of the delaying tactics of the carbon lobby create a situation in which we’re then faced with the possibility of a sudden regulatory shock, something that really inflicts major losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/why-little-ice-age-doesnt-matter/594517/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: No climate event in 2,000 years compares to what’s happening now&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;You quote this astonishing statistic: “One-third of equity and fixed income assets issued in global financial markets can be classified as belonging to the natural resource and extraction sectors, as well as carbon-intensive power utilities, chemicals, construction, and industrial goods firms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Who is in that group? Are those the oil majors such as Exxon, or does that encompass every construction firm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; It isn’t just the oil and gas majors, because they wouldn’t get you to 30 percent. Exxon isn’t big enough to get you to that kind of percentage. It’s Exxon, and [the major automakers] Daimler and BMW, and the entire carbon-exposed complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In Germany right now, there’s a very serious conversation about whether BMW and Daimler are too big to fail. Americans don’t have that sense of a manufacturing industry anymore—except, of course, we did end up bailing out GM in 2008. But Germany is far, far more exposed. A huge slice of their economy is basically all about internal combustion engines, and so that number includes all of those stocks, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;And just to get back to the financial-crisis point, if there were some kind of immediate crunch, and all those stocks tanked …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. If we saw a huge shock to, say, European equity [exchange-traded funds], which were heavily in German automotive, that’s the sort of trigger that we might be looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="441" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/RTX6ZZ4F/dbb7ddf30.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, believes that climate change threatens the global financial system. He spoke with Jerome Powell during a summit in France in July. (Pascal Rossignol / Reuters)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;In your view, what do you see as the goal of climate policy? Is it only to reduce carbon emissions? Do you see any benefits to the economic transition that we scientifically have to make, beyond mitigating climate change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean, that’s been the green-modernization agenda of climate politics, certainly in Europe, since the 1980s, right? This is not simply a zero-sum game; this is a structural transformation that has many very attractive properties. There’s loads of excellent jobs that could be created in this kind of transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There’s no reason why, even by conventional GDP-type metrics, it need even be associated with the kind of feel-bad factor of slow GDP growth. Then [you could] also link it to a revival of social democracy for the United States. From a progressive political point of view, that’s obviously extremely attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whether that will, in fact, ease the formation of majorities in Congress is another question. Because, after all, it does somehow have to get through the Senate, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, well, welcome to the life of a climate-change reporter. You get to talk about lots of ideas and policies, but then it’s all about what will survive the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Exactly. I mean, ever since the 1990s that’s been the logjam on any serious American commitment. So …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;I think part of what I’m asking is: When you look at a third of securities tied up in the carbon economy and the evidence for &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/12/08/decoupling-economic-growth-from-emissions-growth/"&gt;decoupling&lt;/a&gt; GDP growth from carbon emissions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X18305831"&gt;maybe not being as strong as we’d like&lt;/a&gt;, do you think the change that needs to happen is realistic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Realistic? No. I mean, depends what you mean by realism. The scale of the challenge requires a boldness of action for which there is no precedent. That’s the only good purpose that the war analogies serve, in my mind. I think in many ways the war-emergency analogy is terribly unhelpful because [climate change] is not that kind of challenge at all really, but at least that gives you some measure of the scale and urgency of what’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario/579700/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Are we living through climate’s worst-case scenario?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: In your piece, you write: “Those in the United States who call for a Green New Deal or a Green Marshall Plan are, if anything, understating the scale of what is needed.” Do you think climate action needs to be larger&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;than, say, the U.S. mobilization for World War II?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, less large in absolute terms. Because even the U.S. was spending almost 40 percent of GDP on World War II. And if you’re the Soviet Union, you’re spending 55 to 60 percent in 1940. We don’t need to do anything like that. It needs to be much bigger than the New Deal, which in fiscal-policy terms was really quite trivial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Crucially, what makes it totally unlike the war is that there’s no happy end. There’s no moment where you win and then everything goes back to the way it was before, but just better. That’s a misunderstanding. This isn’t crash dieting; this is a permanent change in lifestyle, and we need to love that and we need to live it and we need to own it and we need to reconcile ourselves to the fact that this is for us and for all subsequent generations of humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And furthermore—and much more fundamentally than any of those things—this isn’t really about America. I mean, America can be an obstacle and get in the way, but none of the really hard choices needs to be made by America, and all the really hard choices need to be made by people like China and India and Pakistan and Bangladesh and Indonesia. Our choices are all trivially easy, because for all the assets that we’re going to lose, we need to create $5 trillion worth of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;What’s the closest analogy to what needs to happen? Is there a single historical analogy that we could think of—of a broad transition with no happy victory parades at the end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t think I’m uncomfortable with saying that this is unprecedented, so I’m not sure that looking for analogies is all that helpful, to be honest. I don’t write lessons-from-history-type pieces, because I really buy the hockey stick. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The “hockey stick” graph shows &lt;a href="https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/01.html"&gt;that economic growth over the past 300 years&lt;/a&gt; has been unprecedented compared with human history before it.] In other words, we have never had to fundamentally rethink the energy basis of our way of life. I mean, we never have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;Industrialization has only happened once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Exactly. And furthermore, it has turned out to be exponential—a hockey-stick-style process. So no, it’s not obvious to me that [analogies are] a terribly helpful way of thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It strikes me, perhaps, as an indication of the poverty of our democratic imagination right now that we go backwards so much. One of the striking things about the American left is its nostalgia. There’s always some moment that you can handily pick up, a lesson you can learn from the New Deal. Or if not the New Deal, then the Progressive era. Or if not from the Progressive era, then the Homestead Strike. Like there’s some heritage of struggle that you want to draw on. And that backwards move is—even among the smartest, smartest people on the American left—is a compulsion, almost. It seems to me, in some sense, a mirror image of the strange practice of originalist interpretation of the Constitution. The sheer fact of the continuity of the American political argument, back to the founding, sucks people into this line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You don’t have that very much in Germany. There isn’t anyone in Germany saying, “Which bit of mid-20th-century history is this most like?&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;mercifully. The one analogy that has popped up in Germany is reunification, which I actually think is quite a good one, because that’s still an ongoing problem. So in the American case, it would be civil rights and Reconstruction, which isn’t a particularly optimistic comparison to draw. It’s an ongoing problem, it’s a deep historic problem, it only happened once, we still haven’t fixed it, and we’re not at peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a kind of shallow view of climate change: that it is something we need to avert or stop. And that’s somewhat true. But there’s also a deeper view: that climate change is the situation within which all other politics will happen for the next several generations, at least. That like Reconstruction or the civil-rights movement, it needs to be something that people take on like a moral commitment, in the same way they take on genocide prevention as a moral commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not sure quite why you go to moral commitment here. I can see the attraction of that. But I would take a more functionalist line. Like, morals aside, mass incarceration, the destruction of the lives of millions of African American men—it is clearly a moral issue. But that isn’t, to me, the thing which should give it urgency. The crisis that African American men suffer in the United States is extraordinarily acute and oppresses them every single day of their lives, from cradle to grave. Anyway, this is the point where I think this analogy becomes problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I do like your point that this is a forever problem—at least for all conceivable futures—like working through that problem of racism and the legacies of slavery is a forever problem in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;And there’s a degree to which it also increases the functional load on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. Because problems that we thought we’d fixed, like the Green Revolution and the feeding of the world population, for instance—totally not obvious that those fixes cope with the next 20 years of what’s ahead of us. The food problem that was such an oppressive issue globally in the 1970s may resurge in an absolutely dramatic way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/green-new-deal-economic-principles/582943/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: A centuries-old idea could revolutionize climate policy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;Given all that, if Jerome Powell decided that he wanted to intervene on the side of climate action, what could he do? What could the Fed do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; What I think the Fed should announce is that it enthusiastically supports the idea of a bipartisan infrastructure push focused on the American electrical network, first and foremost, so that we can actually hook up the renewable-generating capacity—which is now eminently, you know, realistic in economic terms. Setting a backstop to a a fiscal-side-led investment push is the obvious thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;So basically it should say: If the government were to issue a bunch of new debt to fund green investment and no one was buying it, then the Fed would?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze: &lt;/strong&gt;And there isn’t the slightest evidence [it wouldn’t sell], because the U.S. Treasury is issuing unprecedented quantities of debt right here and right now. But the Fed would view [the issue of new debt tied to infrastructure] as in no way alarming. It is indeed a highly appropriate response to an environment of extremely low interest rates, and [former Treasury Secretary] Larry Summers &amp;amp; Co. would argue that it might help, as it were, to suck us out of the state of secular stagnation that we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Then you could get into the technicalities of thinking how the Fed addresses issues of finance and green bonds. That would be another avenue to go down—for the Fed to take a role in helping develop a classification of green bonds, of green financing, with a view also to rolling out comprehensive demands for disclosure on the part of American firms, for climate risks to be fully declared on balance sheets, and for due recognition to be given to firms that are in the business of proactively preparing themselves for decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;One idea that you mention in particular is that if there were some kind of green bond, it would count in some greater way against the amount of capital that banks are required to hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, exactly. Where it would really matter is that the Fed could work to modify &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp"&gt;Dodd-Frank regulation&lt;/a&gt; in such a way as to be supportive of that kind of lending, and the Fed could proactively work through &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basel_accord.asp"&gt;the Basel process&lt;/a&gt; [which governs international bank rules] to make changes at the global level. You could, for instance, declare that the Fed views with disfavor the role of several large American banks in continuing to fund coal investment. Some of the carbon-tracking NGOs have done very good work showing and exposing the way in which some of the largest, the most reputable American banks are still in the business of lending to Big Coal. Banking regulation could be tweaked in a way that would produce a tilt against that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer:&lt;/strong&gt; Has the Fed ever done something like this before? Where it’s said, “We need to move the economy in this direction, so we’re going to treat certain asset classes favorably?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, this idea of neutrality comes up: &lt;em&gt;Isn’t the Fed supposed to be neutral?&lt;/em&gt; It’s an attractive idea, and goes along with the idea of Fed independence—except it’s completely ahistorical. I mean, the classic role of the Fed is to support government-issued debt. Insofar as the Green New Deal is a government-issued business, the Fed has just an absolutely historical warrant for supporting fiscal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It hasn’t historically done that—and there’ve been moments where the Fed acted as a goad, notably in the early stages of the Clinton administration. But with regards to the broader economy, the entire federal-government apparatus essentially stood behind the spread of home ownership in the United States and the promotion of suburbanization through the credit system. And kind of what we need is a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: But without the crisis at the end of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became vehicles for truly toxic modes of leverage and intermediation. But if the question is, Is there historical warrant for the financial agencies of government in the United States biasing the property structure in the economy in a certain way?, the answer is emphatically yes—all the way down to the grotesque role of the New Deal financial apparatus in enshrining the racial segregation of the American urban space, with massive effects from the 1930s onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The idea of neutrality should not even be allowed in the room in this argument. It’s a question of where we want to be biased. If you look at QE, especially in the U.K. and the EU, it was effectively fossil-biased. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp"&gt;Quantitative easing&lt;/a&gt;, or QE, is when central banks buy stocks and bonds to boost the economy.] The assets that were bought as part of the asset-purchasing program had heavy carbon contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That’s not surprising: The bonds of the European energy majors have very high ratings, and so they tend to be part of the process of asset purchases. So in the same way as QE is believed to have an effect on inequality through the way in which it drives asset-market prices, it also underwrites the existing biases of the financial system toward fossil fuels. So monetary policy is not neutral with regards to the environment. There’s no safe space here. The only question is whether you’re going to lead in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer:&lt;/strong&gt; Last question. With any of this, is there a role for interested Americans to play if they are not particularly tied to the financial- or monetary-policy elite?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Support your congressperson in doing exactly what AOC did in the hearings with Powell a couple of weeks ago. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Powell &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-10/ocasio-cortez-trump-adviser-unite-to-trash-the-phillips-curve"&gt;whether inflation and unemployment are still closely connected&lt;/a&gt;, as the Fed has long argued.] Applaud, follow with interest, raise questions. That’s exactly what needs to be happening. The politicization of monetary policy is a fact. I mean, I write these pieces because I personally think this is eminently suitable for political conversation. If we don’t raise these questions, the de facto politics is, more often than not, conservative and status quo–oriented. So this, like any other area, is one where citizens—whether they’re educated and informed or not—need to wise up, get involved, and follow the arguments and develop positions. So applaud your congresspeople when they do exactly what AOC was doing in that situation. In many ways, I thought it was one of the most hopeful scenes I’ve seen in that kind of hearing in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/TTCjA6ZVsLw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTS2LUEE/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Leah Millis / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has promised to finish his term even if President Donald Trump demands his resignation.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">How Climate Change Could Trigger the Next Global Financial Crisis</title><published>2019-08-01T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T14:44:33-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The Federal Reserve should act aggressively to reduce that risk, a leading economic historian argues.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/TTCjA6ZVsLw/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/how-fed-could-fight-climate-change-adam-tooze/595084/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595225</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;DETROIT—There’s an elevated train here, in the city’s downtown, called &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/11/detroit-people-mover-elevated-train-transit-boonboggle/574660/"&gt;the People Mover&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t cost much to ride. It goes in a loop every 15 minutes or so. It moves only in one direction, around and around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s a lot like the Democratic primary, after two rounds of formal debate and seven months of campaigning. There have been flashes of dynamism in the campaign so far, candidates who’ve popped for a news cycle or two. But take a step back, and the race has barely changed since before the weather grew warm. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the front-runner in every poll, but he’s a weak front-runner, without a commanding lead or evidence of deep attachment among the voters surveyed. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is holding on to his core voters, but he doesn’t seem to be expanding their ranks. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Senator Kamala Harris of California; and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are always in the mix in third or fourth place. And then there’s everyone else: the candidates who sometimes grab as much as 4 or 5 percent but rarely more, and rarely for more than a few days. The only major change is that former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, a onetime front-runner, is now firmly a part of the latter tier.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/democrats-want-have-it-both-ways-barack-obama/595270/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David A. Graham: The Democratic candidates are deeply ambivalent about Obama&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last night’s debate represented, in many ways, what a presidential-primary debate should be: strong, polished candidates having a sharp, substantive discussion about crucial issues facing the country. Biden showed much more energy than he did with his Rip Van Winkle impression at the previous debate. Harris had another scrap with Biden, which is what she seemed to want. And several candidates who’ve been eager for more public attention got what they were looking for: Senators &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/gillibrand-biden-women/595264/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Kirsten Gillibrand&lt;/a&gt; of New York and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/cory-booker-democratic-debate-biden-criminal-justice/595255/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Cory Booker&lt;/a&gt; of New Jersey, for example, had two of the biggest moments onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But I couldn’t find almost anyone at the debate site who was confident that the night would change the dynamics of the race. Most of the campaign staffers and other Democratic operatives I spoke with were confident it wouldn’t. The exception was Booker’s aides, with his campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, telling me after the debate that “we have fresh eyes on us now, and I think that’s important.” (He said Booker raised more money online during the 10 p.m. ET hour, following the debate, than he usually does in three days.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After the previous set of debates, in June, the polls scrambled briefly. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro’s numbers jumped for the first time, while Harris’s shot up significantly. But both candidates’ polling quickly settled back to what it had been before, and Biden’s numbers climbed once again. Around and around, in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The resiliency of our numbers is because voters know this guy. They know him at a different level than some of the other candidates,” a Biden-campaign official told reporters at a briefing ahead of the debate, speaking to us on the condition of anonymity. “You see where his vote is today, and it’s exactly where it was pre–[first] debate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Still, Biden, who has near-universal name ID, rarely receives more than 25 percent in any primary poll. His campaign argues that ceiling isn’t a problem. “With 20 candidates, it’s hard for anyone to get more of the vote,” the official told me. “It’s just physics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For Biden, last night was crucial: He wasn’t likely to put away a primary race that still has many candidates in the running and months left to go. But if he was caught “off guard” again, as another Biden-campaign official put it a few hours before the debate, recovering may have been difficult. Overall, however, the vice president seemed to survive the night just fine, despite some trouble spots defending the details of his record and policy proposals. That likely means other candidates won’t have much room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Biden staffers, for their part, said they were satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, told me afterward that the former vice president had “answered wholeheartedly” for any leftover concern from the first debate “about his ability to take on Trump, his ability to push back.” So, I asked her, does that mean she expects Biden will start to consolidate support and launch himself over 40 percent in the polls? “I think the debates, fundamentally, are flash points in the race,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/cory-booker-democratic-debate-biden-criminal-justice/595255/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Cory Booker exposed a key Biden weakness&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One Democratic operative, who is unaffiliated with any campaign but watched the debate, offered a blunt take, on the condition of anonymity, that’s popular among many Democrats outside of Biden HQ: “We have a lot of great candidates, and the more people see them, the more a weak front-runner looks weak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told me that he sees the current moment as “mile eight in a marathon,” and that he doesn’t think the race—or the candidate tiers—is set in stone. Hopeful candidates echoed that assessment in interviews last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are so many candidates right now that people are kind of grouping folks: ‘Here’s my top three’; ‘here’s my top five,’” Castro told me. “Once we get to a field that is a little bit smaller, then I think people are going to make decisions about who they’re going to support.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I still believe there’s only about 24 people in America who know who they’re going to vote for,” said Washington Governor Jay Inslee. “And they’re all the candidates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Several Democrats I spoke with, who work for a range of presidential candidates, agreed that the person most likely to benefit from last night wasn’t even onstage: Warren, who had a strong performance Tuesday night but whose campaign is less dependent than others on breakout moments in the debates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now the campaign is on to the next stop: The candidates won’t all meet again for six weeks, when the next debate gets under way in Houston in September. Less than half of the field is expected to qualify. More than a few candidates are expected to run out of money. Chances are, the race will finally get thrown off the loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/I7fo06POoAY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Edward-Isaac Dovere</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/edward-isaac-dovere/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/Loop/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Lucas Jackson / Reuters / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Democratic Primary Is Right Back Where It Started</title><published>2019-08-01T09:31:24-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T09:31:24-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The debates haven’t come close to upending the race.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/I7fo06POoAY/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/biden-harris-democratic-debates/595225/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595123</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;People tend to build themselves on family history, yet the myths that multiply within every family reveal that history’s malleability. Two recent novels—Juliet Grames’s debut, &lt;em&gt;The Seven or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna&lt;/em&gt;, and Leah Hager Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;Strangers and Cousins&lt;/em&gt;—illustrate this dynamic, the families within each grappling with a matriarch who has lost her memory. Though the characters’ attempts to piece together the stories of their elders read in part as a way of recognizing these forgetful and forgotten women, the process affirms the identities of the younger generations even more, by endowing them with a history—whether imagined or not—that can guide their present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Seven or Eight Deaths of Stella Fortuna&lt;/em&gt;, the act of telling a story on a relative’s behalf raises questions about a person’s right to define her own legacy. As the novel begins, an accident has not only disabled Stella, the narrator’s grandmother, but also scrambled her memories; she now believes that her sister, Tina, has always envied her, cursing her with a lifetime of bad luck. Most of the family dismisses Stella as old and resentful, so the narrator takes it upon herself to interview Tina about Stella’s life and write the story as “the disinterment of Stella Fortuna, an explication of her too-strange life and a restoration of her besmirched good name.” Backboned by a familiar immigration narrative, the novel follows Stella through her near-death experiences from southern Italy to suburban Connecticut, revealing a woman who, to her family’s frustration, has always been fiercely headstrong and independent. Having grown up with an abusive father, she views the affections of men as threats to her freedom, and sex as subservience. Her resistance to being “mastered” permeates the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, though, the novel itself is in some ways an act of mastery. It’s a chronicle of Stella’s life that is mediated and controlled by the narrator, who not only bookends Stella’s saga with present-day scenes, but also occasionally inserts herself into the story to offer commentary or flash forward. When recounting Stella’s father’s immigration to the United States, for example, the narrator jumps in to reference Italy’s current refugee crisis, noting that “history marches on, and names and destinations change, but not the injustices we let one another suffer.” This interruption, while it may feel heavy-handed for a novel, mirrors the way an elder may interrupt her own story to note its lesson for the world today. The novel reads like a fable, its language often formal and overdramatized, as if to convey a sense of timelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, the novel’s focus on establishing meaning for Stella’s life—and, moreover, for the narrator’s—comes to outweigh its stated goal of reclaiming the older woman’s reputation. The narrator, whose mother was the only one of Stella’s children to move out of their Italian neighborhood, sees herself as “a quasi-outsider” whose distance from the family enables her to tell their story. At the same time, she understands how her life is indebted to Stella’s, admitting that “my relationship with her misery is nuanced, because I am a product of it.” Sympathy yields gratitude; for instance, after describing how Stella’s husband didn’t immediately choose to save her life during a traumatic childbirth, the narrator reflects: “How lucky I am that I can’t imagine being married to a man who wouldn’t immediately pick me.” This retelling of Stella’s story becomes an effort to contextualize and validate the narrator’s life. In the long run, sharing the details of her grandmother’s biography serves to bring the narrator closer to her family and cement her own place within their history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strangers and Cousins&lt;/em&gt;, Cohen’s sixth novel and 11th book, doesn’t position itself as an account of family history the way &lt;em&gt;Stella Fortuna &lt;/em&gt;does, but the intergenerational relationships it portrays similarly show how such legacies work as a tool for younger generations. In upstate New York, the chaotic Blumenthal family prepares for 22-year-old Clem’s wedding to her college girlfriend, Diggs. Cohen takes the role of the omniscient narrator to a humorous extreme, diving into the minds of not only the family members, but also the mouse family that has lived within their house’s walls for as many generations as the Blumenthals. This device, like the elaborate language in &lt;em&gt;Stella Fortuna&lt;/em&gt;, draws attention to the artifice involved in the stories the Blumenthals tell themselves. As they experience a slew of changes (a wedding, new neighbors, Clem’s mother’s pregnancy, the impending sale of the house), the family members reflect on their own lives and their place in family history, often looking toward Aunt Glad, the family matriarch, and her past for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Stella, Glad is not “besmirched” in the family’s opinion, but she is dismissed. Her relatives politely nod when she repeats things, an indifferent response that sends her “floating down the current of irrelevance.” The last of her generation, she moves in and out of lucidity as she flashes back to a traumatic early life—including her younger brother’s death in a fire—that the family knows little of but has long imagined. Their speculation becomes a form of self-awareness and, moreover, self-affirmation. Clem, for example, wonders if Glad, who has always been single, is gay, and then applies this newly written history to herself: “Clem, at once genuinely moved by these musings and rather pleased by being thus moved, plucks a black-eyed Susan and slides its stem behind her ear. She vows never to lose a sense of gratitude. How fortunate she is to be able to marry her beloved!” Like the narrator of &lt;em&gt;Stella Fortuna&lt;/em&gt;, Clem understands her ancestors’ lives as a way of appreciating her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this approach could seem self-serving at times, the novel’s earnest tone buffers such a perception. Family history is “a privilege,” as Diggs reminds Clem; her own ancestors were enslaved, making their life stories largely untraceable. Accordingly, Cohen recognizes the Blumenthals’ efforts, even when clumsy, to know what they can of Glad’s past and present. When Glad begins to die, Walter, Clem’s father, tries to pay his respects by thinking “of her whole life. To hold in his mind the enormity of one human existence.” However, Walter’s thoughts of Glad soon become a sounding board for his own concerns about newcomers in his life, as he thinks back to what “doddering” Glad had told him out of the blue: “We must have those new people over.” Though it’s unclear whether she was actually referring to the new neighbors, Glad influences Walter to be more welcoming. The effort to interpret Glad’s intentions is really a search for her legacy, and for lessons that the family members can apply to their own lives. It’s a self-focused effort, but a noble one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Grames’s and Cohen’s novels, the very uncertainty of the past gives these legacies their power. Old stories acquire new meaning when their narrators change; as Cohen writes, “One generation’s unforgivable error becomes the next generation’s act of grace.” The gaps in these accounts become as meaningful as the facts, the process of searching for history coming to shape the present and future for Glad’s and Stella’s descendants. By piecing together the “truth” of their forebears’ stories, these characters come to better understand themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/O5OgO-YOgJc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Rachael Allen</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/rachael-allen/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/shutterstock_435973405/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>fantom_rd / Shutterstock</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Reconstructing the Memories of Aging Matriarchs</title><published>2019-08-01T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T10:04:57-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Two recent novels attempt to unearth the pasts of forgetful family members, weighing the benefits of storytelling for older and younger generations.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/O5OgO-YOgJc/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/stella-fortuna-strangers-and-cousins-review/595123/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595276</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How should Democrats even debate climate policy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a harder question than it may seem. Climate change is a sprawling, scary, cinematic problem, and its remedies involve the less-than-inspiring technical undergirding of society: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/why-cities-flood/538251/?utm_source=feed"&gt;stormwater management&lt;/a&gt;, the electrical grid, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-winning-climate-strategy/576514/?utm_source=feed"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;. And dirt management will never be as engrossing as, say, Medicare for All. The party may also benefit, in a sort of shallow but undeniable way, from its monopoly on climate concern. Since any Democrat would do more to fight climate change than the current president, what’s the point of airing dirty laundry about it in public?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have all put out highly similar visions on climate,” South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday night. “We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are lots of reasons to talk about it. Debates can inform the public about vital issues, as much as about the candidates, and on this topic, the Democrats running for president have real disagreements. This primary has taught them how to talk about those disputes in a way that is accessible, useful, and urgent. (And Buttigieg’s claim that they share “highly similar visions” on climate, for instance, is more than a little self-serving: His campaign has been less specific about its own climate plans.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest fissure last night had former Vice President Joe Biden on one side and Washington Governor Jay Inslee on the other. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/bidens-climate-plan-mini-green-new-deal/591046/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Biden’s climate proposal&lt;/a&gt; aims for a “100 percent clean-energy economy” by 2050. It asks Congress to spend $1.7 trillion on new climate-friendly programs. Inslee’s plan, by contrast, requires &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/jay-insles-climate-plan-keeping-it-100/588652/?utm_source=feed"&gt;most of the economy to go 100 percent clean by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, and it calls for &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/6/24/18715163/jay-inslee-climate-plan-phase-out-fossil-fuels"&gt;$9 trillion in investment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/controversial-study-asks-do-renewable-energy-standards-work/588823/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Do renewable-energy standards work?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to have a bold plan. And mine has been called the gold standard,” Inslee said last night. (Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, specifically, called his plan the gold standard.) “Middle-ground solutions like the vice president has proposed or sort of average-sized things are not going to save us. Too little, too late is too dangerous,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden, who has proposed a legitimately ambitious climate policy, seemed thrown. The United States is responsible for only 15 percent of global carbon emissions, he said. For the other 85 percent, the world needs something that “I helped negotiate … the Paris climate accord.” He promised to “rejoin that accord, and I would make sure we up the ante. I would be able to bring those leaders together that I know and convene them in the White House, and I would raise the standard.” His plan would also spend $400 billion on clean-energy R&amp;amp;D and build half a million charging stations for electric cars by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the candidates onstage then sided with Inslee. “I have to agree with Governor Inslee,” Senator Kamala Harris said at the start of her answer. She then quoted a line from his stump speech. A few minutes later, Senator Cory Booker made the same move. “I want to take a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee,” he said. “Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords. That is kindergarten.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booker then argued that every aspect of the U.S. government, from its trade deals to its economic policies, must center on climate change. (Inslee has already proposed plans advancing similar ideas.) “The majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we’re going to deal with this is if the United States leads,” Booker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/democrats-try-to-resurrect-the-paris-agreement/585982/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Democrats try to resurrect the Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pursuing ambitious climate policy would have repercussions, and across the two evenings of debate, one of the clearest disagreements was about the right status for the fossil-fuel industry. Inslee argues that the oil and gas industry is the primary obstacle to taking climate action. Any attempt to reduce carbon emissions, he says, must address Big Oil’s power head-on. Siding with him most clearly are Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Sanders went even further than Inslee on the first night of the debates. “What do you do with an industry that knowingly—for billions of dollars of short-term profits—is destroying this planet?” asked the senator from Vermont. “I say that is criminal activity. That cannot be allowed to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone was won over by that antagonism. Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, warned that demonizing fossil-fuel companies could also demonize their employees. John Hickenlooper, Colorado’s governor, was skittish too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden, meanwhile, seems like he’s trying to split the difference. A moderator asked, “Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?” Biden quickly replied: “No.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he immediately amended that answer. “We would work it out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/qqpHFewuTXs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_1165425370/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Scott Olson / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">‘Nobody Should Get Applause for Rejoining the Paris Climate Accords’</title><published>2019-08-01T07:00:55-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T10:29:40-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Democrats have figured out how to talk about climate change with urgency and air real differences among the candidates’ ideas for dealing with it.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/qqpHFewuTXs/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/pretty-good-democratic-debate-about-climate-change/595276/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595273</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There was a post-superpower quality to this week’s Democratic debates. On both nights, foreign policy came up near the end, and the discussion focused mostly on the need to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, avoid war with Iran and, in Michael Bennet’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/01/transcript-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.f5d3cbb0d626"&gt;words&lt;/a&gt;, “invest in America again.” That’s fine, as far as it goes. But there was strikingly little discussion about America’s role in upholding a particular balance of power in the world. It was almost as if these Democratic candidates were running for prime minister of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That’s a problem, because the United States &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; trying to uphold a particular balance of power, even as the economic and military might of China keeps growing. Washington is now pursuing roughly the same grand strategy that ended in war with Japan in 1941: preventing any single Asian power from dominating the Western Pacific. China is challenging that effort. And unless the world’s two superpowers accommodate each other, that challenge could lead to war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What kind of accommodations would Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, or Joe Biden make to avoid that? Would they fight for Taiwan or for American access through the South China Sea, the two places where World War III is most likely to break out? No debate watcher would have any idea. China came up 16 times during Tuesday night’s debate—every time in the context of trade. But in the section of the evening devoted to national security, it wasn’t mentioned once. Things were much the same on Wednesday night: eight mentions of China, seven about trade and one stray reference by Tulsi Gabbard to “nuclear-armed countries like Russia and China and North Korea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To treat great-power competition as an afterthought is irresponsible, even dangerous. In 2015, Graham Allison, a longtime student of American foreign policy, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/?utm_source=feed"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “War between the United States and China in the decades ahead is … much more likely than recognized at the moment. Indeed, judging by the historical record, war is more likely than not.” His analysis emerged from a historical &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Destined-War-America-Escape-Thucydidess-ebook/dp/B01IAS9FZY"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of interactions between established and rising powers, two-thirds of which have ended in military conflict. In 2016, Steve Bannon &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/02/steve-bannon-donald-trump-war-south-china-sea-no-doubt"&gt;put&lt;/a&gt; it more unequivocally: “We’re going to war in the South China Sea in the next five to 10 years … There’s no doubt about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since Donald Trump took office, he has made Bannon’s prediction more likely. The United States has officially designated China a “&lt;a href="https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf"&gt;strategic competitor&lt;/a&gt;.” American warships are sailing &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/us-military-support-taiwan-whats-changed-under-trump"&gt;more frequently&lt;/a&gt; through the Taiwan Strait even as Beijing warns &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-takes-aim-at-us-taiwan-in-new-military-blueprint/2019/07/24/38168b14-adbf-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html?utm_term=.2dd308b5892e"&gt;more forcefully&lt;/a&gt; that it is willing to use force to reintegrate the island into China. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/world/asia/us-china-navy.html?module=inline"&gt;Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/22/us/politics/china-sanctions-russia-military.html?module=inline"&gt; between&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/world/asia/china-us-security-mattis.html?module=inline"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/world/asia/us-china-rimpac-military-exercise-tensions.html?module=inline"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; militaries has &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/u-s-china-relations-is-it-time-to-end-the-engagement/"&gt;largely collapsed&lt;/a&gt;. Beijing is increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/business/american-businesses-china.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%2520Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;harassing and detaining&lt;/a&gt; American citizens. And the U.S.-China economic relationship, which once kept hostility between the two superpowers in check, is now contributing to the animosity. Last month, some of America’s leading China scholars published an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/making-china-a-us-enemy-is-counterproductive/2019/07/02/647d49d0-9bfa-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html?utm_term=.844a145e8e58"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the president and Congress warning of a dangerous “downward spiral in relations” between the two most powerful nations on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s easy to see why Democrats don’t talk much about America’s political and military relationship with Beijing. Trade with China directly affects ordinary Americans. East Asian geopolitics, by contrast, sounds remote and obscure. But the two issues are deeply intertwined, as the Obama administration recognized when it negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership to deepen America’s Asian alliances and prevent China from creating regional blocs that exiled the United States. The current Democratic debate doesn’t recognize that. This week, for instance, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rolled out her trade policy, which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/29/8933825/elizabeth-warren-trade-economic-patriotism"&gt;would require&lt;/a&gt; that any new trade deals meet high standards for labor, environmental, and human rights. Those are wonderful aspirations. But Beijing is extremely unlikely to meet them, which means Warren is prepared to make the current trade war with Beijing permanent, thus removing the economic guardrails that have helped keep military competition in the Pacific from spiraling out of control. That’s the problem with unveiling a trade policy when you don’t have a broader China policy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While Democrats ignore the growing cold war with China, Republicans are embracing it. For younger Republicans like Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton, who want to fuse Trump’s populist rhetoric on trade with their own hawkishness on military matters, China is the perfect answer. It’s the place where Trumpism and neoconservatism meet. Bannon earlier this year helped reconstitute the Committee on the Present Danger, first created to scare Americans about the Soviet threat in the 1970s, in order to do the same about China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the Cold War with the Soviet Union stayed cold in part because in central Europe, where it really mattered, the Soviet Union lacked the will to fundamentally challenge the division of Europe that ran through Berlin. In Eastern Europe, the U.S.S.R. already had its sphere of influence and lacked the economic vigor to try to expand it. China, by contrast, is a rising power that doesn’t yet have a military sphere of influence. It’s trying to create one in places like the South China Sea, where Chinese and American warships came within &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-chinese-warship-reportedly-threatened-a-us-navy-destroyer-in-the-south-china-sea-2018-11"&gt;45 yards&lt;/a&gt; of colliding last September. And it sees reacquiring Taiwan as its national destiny, even as Rubio and Cotton propose ever closer military ties between Taipei and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the past, Allison has &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/?utm_source=feed"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding war between established and rising powers “required huge, painful adjustments in attitudes and actions on the part not just of the challenger but also the challenged.” Republicans want to do exactly the opposite: Ensure that America doesn’t give China an inch. The Democrats onstage Tuesday and Wednesday, for their part, said almost nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That might be okay if the United States were Canada. But the next president will make decisions that could determine whether there’s a World War III. And right now an American watching the Democratic presidential campaign would have no idea there’s any risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Ydu8VX1vN7U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Peter Beinart</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/peter-beinart/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/china/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Paul Sancya / AP / The Atlantic</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">But What About China?</title><published>2019-08-01T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T11:12:28-04:00</updated><summary type="html">To treat great-power competition as an afterthought is irresponsible, even dangerous.

Why won’t this drive even more people to come to the U.S. illegally?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we’ll have strong border protections,” Sanders responded, later adding, “When I talk about health care as a human right, that applies to all people in this country. And under a Medicare for All single-payer system, we could afford to do that.” But Montana Governor Steve Bullock countered him. “This is the part of the discussion that shows how often these debates are detached from people’s lives,” he said. “We’ve got 100,000 people showing up at the border right now. If we decriminalize entry, if we give health care to everyone, we’ll have multiples of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The back-and-forth was the continuation of an argument from the last &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/2020-democrats-undocumented-health-care/593761/?utm_source=feed"&gt;round of debates&lt;/a&gt;—so many candidates, so much debate—and an encapsulation of something known as the “welfare magnet hypothesis.” The hypothesis is a deeply intuitive one: If you provide migrants with generous benefits, more of them will come. But it does not seem to be true. Migrants do not seem to be swayed by the generosity of benefits, or at least not heavily swayed by them; the prevalence of social networks and the availability of jobs are far more important factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The welfare magnet hypothesis was developed in the late 1990s by George Borjas, a Harvard economist and a &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w6813"&gt;major influence&lt;/a&gt; on right-of-center immigration policy. He reasoned that people arriving in the United States would respond to welfare incentives differently than native-born citizens or already settled immigrants. New immigrants need to make a choice about where to live, making welfare generosity more salient to them than to residents for whom moving would be an expensive, difficult hassle. Lo and behold: “Immigrant welfare recipients are indeed more heavily clustered in high-benefit states than the immigrants who do not receive welfare, or than natives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigrants were particularly attracted to California, Borjas found. But was that because the state offered the second-most-generous welfare benefit package at the time? Or because many of those immigrants were refugees placed in California by the agencies sponsoring them? Or because of California’s location on the Mexico border? Or because it had such a strong economy and significant job opportunities? Or because of its generally immigrant-friendly politics? Or because of the prevalence of speakers of Spanish and other languages? Or because many new, lower-income immigrants had social ties to the state? Borjas said he detected strong suggestive evidence that welfare generosity was at work, but never proved causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might be because there was nothing to prove: Welfare is just not that strong a magnet. The Clinton administration’s 1996 welfare-reform law created a natural experiment demonstrating this fact. The bill barred immigrants from receiving cash welfare, but some states opted to use their own funds to provide it. If those benefits were a big draw, more single-parent families would have headed to the states offering them. But that did not turn out to &lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/425433"&gt;be the case&lt;/a&gt;. Another influential study looked at poor single women with children moving across state lines, and found &lt;a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/article/sprjopoec/v_3a12_3ay_3a1999_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a391-409.htm"&gt;much the same&lt;/a&gt;: “We find little evidence indicating that welfare-induced migration is a widespread phenomenon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sociological studies and surveys of immigrants help illuminate why: People tend to move for jobs and social networks, more so than for government benefits. The big &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IF11151.pdf"&gt;push factors&lt;/a&gt; spurring families to leave places such as the Northern Triangle include violence, political persecution, natural disasters, and poverty; the big &lt;a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R45489.pdf"&gt;pull factors&lt;/a&gt; drawing them in include the availability of work and the possibility of family reunification. It makes sense. If you are a Honduran family fleeing horrific poverty and miserable crime, what is going to be more appealing to you: moving where your cousins live and have found work, where they can help you get an apartment and help you put your kids through school, or moving where there is the option of enrolling in a health program for indigent workers regardless of immigration status? (To be clear, the United States bars legal immigrants from enrolling in the major federal benefit programs for years, and bars undocumented immigrants from ever participating.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of specific immigrant populations also show that most newcomers to the country are not interested in &lt;a href="https://thecorrespondent.com/6307/more-than-anything-refugees-want-to-work-for-a-living-so-why-are-they-getting-so-little-help/420285866-3edb3f47"&gt;living on the dole&lt;/a&gt;. “Cultural repertoires incline Mexican immigrants to utilize welfare not primarily to avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of dependency, but rather mostly to minimize employment discontinuities,” one &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260063065_Explaining_Mexican-Immigrant_Welfare_Behaviors_The_Importance_of_Employment-Related_Cultural_Repertoires"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examinations of Europe’s immigration policies help cement the case. Evidence “of a welfare magnet in European countries is weak or nonexistent,” one &lt;a href="https://wol.iza.org/articles/welfare-magnet-hypothesis-and-welfare-take-up-of-migrants/long"&gt;review of the literature&lt;/a&gt; concluded. “The ‘magnet effect’ of the welfare program is rather low compared with the role played by the receiving country’s macroeconomic fundamentals, such as the unemployment rate and average wages. For example, some of the estimates show that the effect of wages is ten times larger than that of benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the United States were to start offering health benefits to immigrants—a dramatic policy change—it is possible that more people might want to come. But would they migrate for the health benefits, or because they understood the benefits as a sign that the country was becoming more welcoming to immigrants and that they had less to fear from the American state? It seems impossible to separate the two motivations cleanly. An America that offered immigrants health care would be an America far more humane than it is now, with its white nationalism and institutionalized xenophobia and cages for babies and &lt;a href="https://res.mdpi.com/societies/societies-08-00083/article_deploy/societies-08-00083.pdf?filename=&amp;amp;attachment=1"&gt;welfare chauvinism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underpinning Bash’s question, of course, is the implication that migrants come to the United States to suck up scarce resources, and that non-native families are takers rather than makers. This is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/09/are-immigrants-drain-government-resources/571582/?utm_source=feed"&gt;also untrue&lt;/a&gt;. The math of immigration is never zero-sum, and the country’s resources are never finite. Over the long run, immigrant and refugee families do not just make the economy bigger, but also pay more in taxes than they &lt;a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/en/research/papers/2017/~/media/documents/research/papers/2017/wp1704.pdf"&gt;take in benefits&lt;/a&gt;. They make the country stronger and richer, and its finances more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given those dynamics, it is worth asking the inverse of Bash’s question: If we want to pay for health care for all Americans, why don’t we let a lot more immigrants in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/YwRX5NS0nIc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Annie Lowrey</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/annie-lowrey/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTX71Q3Z/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Loren Elliot / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Migrant families walk to a humanitarian center after being released from federal detention in Texas.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Conservatives Are Wrong About What’s Driving Immigration</title><published>2019-08-01T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T10:48:37-04:00</updated><summary type="html">It’s jobs and social networks that bring immigrants to America—not government benefits.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/YwRX5NS0nIc/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/immigrants-arent-coming-for-our-health-care/595240/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595231</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;She mistreated me. I mistreated her. But we loved each other, we’d proclaim time and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I’d listened for “I love you,” as if listening for a sign of life, like a doctor listening for a beating heart. I had been led to believe “I love you” is that beating heart of love. Say it, love lives.

The desire to be in something I thought was loving drove me back time and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I was fragile, and insecure. Oh, I wanted to hear her heart beat those three sweet words, wanted to say them time and again. Hearing them and saying them made me feel so good. Love, I thought, was all about feelings. Certainly not growth. Love, I thought, was supposed to make me feel good.

He has built his political project on the fraught and popular philosophy that love is said, love is felt—that love is a noun. Listening to Trump’s soundtrack of hate, it is easy to miss that he considers the songs on his MAGA soundtrack to be love songs. Trump’s central political message: “I love America—and want to give back—so we can MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp;amp; GREAT AGAIN, TOGETHER,” as he &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/photos/a.488852220724/10157602078260725/?type=3&amp;amp;comment_id=10157603485680725&amp;amp;reply_comment_id=515436595333030&amp;amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; before the 2016 election. “I AM FIGHTING FOR YOU” against those who hate America, he promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/residents-of-baltimore-and-other-democrat-run-cities-are-living-in-hell-trump-declares/"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, “Those people are living in hell in Baltimore,” and when he tweeted on Saturday that majority-black Baltimore is such “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” that “no human being would want to live there,” he considers those statements to be love. “They really appreciate what I’m doing,” he said. He considers Representative Elijah Cummings to be hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1009071403918864385?lang=en"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; on June 19, 2018, that Democrats “don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,” that is what he considers love. He &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/politics/donald-trump-state-of-the-union-2019-transcript/index.html"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; Americans during his State of the Union address earlier this year “to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To the red-hats, Trump himself embodies love, and his critics, especially the antiracist critics of color, embody hate. Al Sharpton “Hates Whites &amp;amp; Cops,” as Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1155787721576779776"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/trump-makes-reasons-stoke-racial-fears/594973/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Peter Beinart: Trump is making up reasons to stoke racial fears&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In advance of Trump’s Fourth of July event in Washington, Trump opponents and supporters squared off all the way from the White House to the expanse of the National Mall. At one point, the red-hats &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/nothing-america-cant-do-donald-trump-touts-us-military-strength-in-4th-of-july-speech/ar-AADRHYQ"&gt;chanted&lt;/a&gt;, “I love America, I love America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For many Trump supporters, to love Trump is to love white people is to love America. To hate Trump is to hate white people is to hate America. This love-hate duality is essential to understanding Trumpism, and essential to the mind game Trump and his lieutenants have been playing with white Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/majority-of-every-segment-of-white-voters-approves-of-trump-except-one-poll"&gt;Fox News survey&lt;/a&gt;, Trump still retains majority approval from every segment of white voters except college-educated white women. White people, too, are victims of his domestic assaults, his alternative facts, his dalliances with Vladimir Putin, his tariffs, and his tax cuts for the super-rich. But while many white voters break up and make up with Trump, most never leave. Their &lt;em&gt;white fragility&lt;/em&gt;, to use Robin DiAngelo’s &lt;a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780807047415"&gt;term&lt;/a&gt;, makes them crave the security of Trumpism. He loves them. They love America. He is America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He is them. They are him. Whiteness all told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The red-hats don’t like being told that their pro-life label is bogus when they are not fiercely opposing the march to war with Iran; that their defense of American Jews is a charade when they join forces with anti-Semitic white nationalists; or that their Christian identity is a sham when they worship a man who is the antithesis of Jesus Christ. Trump makes the red-hats feel good by telling them he loves them, and by telling them they are not racist—their antiracist critics are the real racists. He makes them feel good when he says that they are the real patriots, that their “civilization” is superior, and that they have more because they work harder and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/malleability-american-identity/594508/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Juliet Lapidos: The day I learned I was American&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At his &lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/donald-trump-maga-event-speech-transcript-north-carolina-rally"&gt;campaign rally&lt;/a&gt; in Greenville, North Carolina, on July 17, Trump said of his kind, “We love our nation.” He said that four congresswomen of color are “hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down.” They “never have anything good to say.” He suggested that children “should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.” Which is to say, children should always say good things about Trump. “Love it,” or rather him, or “leave it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Before Trump attacked congresswomen of color, he attacked the Obama administration in similar terms. “Americans love their country,” Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-state-union-address/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in his first State of the Union address, in 2018, “and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.” To Trump, love means loyalty. No, not loyalty. Obligation. No, not obligation. Submission. Complete submission. No criticism, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;No matter all the women who’ve &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/list-trumps-accusers-allegations-sexual-misconduct/story?id=51956410"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; him of sexual misconduct. No matter all the brutal bigotry falling from his lips. No matter the natural disasters getting worse under his watch of climate denial. No matter the crimes against humanity along the southern border that we will all one day have to atone for. No matter his desire to spend billions on a border wall when America’s infrastructure is collapsing. No matter all the high crimes and misdemeanors described in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And he loves America? He is demanding submission.

I felt I loved her, almost at first sight, when we met outside the Richmond Coliseum. I felt I loved her because I had such a strong emotional attachment to her, because I didn’t want to let her go. I felt I loved her because I ignored my rational relatives and friends and thoughts telling me to let myself go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Masters of love&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After a while, when the mistreatment deepened, I could not reconcile the love she said she had for me with the love she did not give. I could not reconcile the love I said I had for her with the love I did not give. I finally let myself go from this unhealthy relationship, but I struggled to leave my unhealthy relationship with love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;My emotional attachment to her paled in potency to my emotional attachment to the popular conception of love as a noun, of love as a feeling, of love as something that is said. Insecurity bound us together. Wanting to be loved kept the shackle locked. But I recognized myself as being shackled, a recognition that keyed my freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I decide to change my relationship with love not through entering another serious relationship. I entered the library, searching for books that could free me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I found bell hooks’s books on love, which formed her “love song to the nation,” and devoured them. But it was the first of those four volumes, &lt;em&gt;All About Love&lt;/em&gt;, that made the deepest impression. “The word ‘love’ is most often defined as a noun, yet all the more astute theorists of love acknowledge that we would all love better if we used it as a verb,” she &lt;a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780060959470"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Love is about nurturing one’s own growth or another’s growth, she told me. Love is not instinctual. We choose to love a romantic partner, a relative, a friend. “Love and abuse cannot coexist.” What about feeling? “When we feel deeply drawn to someone, we cathect with them; that is, we invest feelings or emotion in them.” Cathexis is different from love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It was painful to admit that the relationship I had just left was rarely love. Painful to admit that I had not known regular love, had not been regularly loving to people I claimed to love. But with that admission came more freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I felt free to grow through critique. I started reevaluating relationships and people and myself. Who had been a constructive force in my life? Who had been a destructive force in my life? Was I a constructive force in my own life, or in the lives of others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We can ask the same questions of America: Who is a constructive and destructive force in America’s political life? Who is wounding America? Who is putting Band-Aids on problems that need surgeries?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/racism-campaign-strategy/593962/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David A. Graham: Trump goes all in on racism&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Growth necessitates deep-seated, fundamental critiques. But radical critiques can hurt feelings. Asking these questions hurt me to my core. But no longer was I equating simply feeling good with love, or feeling bad with hate. Instead, I was starting to think of love as a constructive act, and hate as a destructive one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Trump says he loves America, and he whispers sweet somethings that sound so good to his red-hatted supporters, but is he really nurturing their growth? Trump has shattered America in two: those who love him, whom he can abuse, and those who hate him, whom he can fight. How is that love? How is he being caring, affectionate, respectful, trusting, and honest—what hooks considers the active ingredients of love—to his supporters, let alone to the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If love is a verb, then hate is also a verb. Trump hates America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Racists can’t possibly love America. They are anti-growth, only talking about what they and America and Trump are not: not racist. They can’t look past their own hierarchal worldview to see that the problems afflicting them are not caused by other races, but by power and policy. Racism is hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Antiracists must practice love. Antiracists must nurture themselves and America no matter the pain that is essential to healing. They must construct antiracist ideas that say there’s nothing wrong with our race or any other. They must nurture their communities and institutions by constructing antiracist policies that yield racial equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The beating heart of love is nurturing, is constructing, is pumping out growth, like a person striving each moment to be antiracist. Doing it, love lives. Not doing it, love dies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Love (of America) is a verb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/gRnrTDnsHtM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Ibram X.

This is the recurring theme within the new movement of “national conservatives” attempting to reshape the American right. One of their most controversial thinkers is the University of Pennsylvania law professor Amy Wax, who recently drew controversy by saying the United States should consider “cultural distance” in deciding which immigrants to admit or reject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The premise, as Wax &lt;a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/07/26/heres-amy-wax-really-said-immigration/"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt; during the inaugural &lt;a href="https://nationalconservatism.org/"&gt;national conservatism&lt;/a&gt; conference earlier this month, is that “many, indeed most, inhabitants of the Third World don’t necessarily share our ideas and beliefs; others pay lip service, but don’t really comprehend them. There are exceptions, of course, but most people are not exceptional.” Based on that premise, she concludes that “embracing cultural distance, cultural-distance nationalism, means, in effect, taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites. Well, that is the result anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Wax is making a major assumption: that people from European countries hold the same “ideas and beliefs” Americans do. When President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/01/12/577673191/trump-wishes-we-had-more-immigrants-from-norway-turns-out-we-once-did"&gt;states a preference&lt;/a&gt; for Norwegian immigrants over those from developing countries, he is—by a very charitable reading of his remarks—presuming the same thing. Yet there are two basic problems with this assumption: First, Americans don’t even agree on what American culture is. Second, the United States and European democracies have historically defined their national cultures in rather different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Wax’s remarks became public, other conservatives have defended her against accusations of prejudice. Yet the debate over whether what she said technically qualifies as racist obscures the bigger issue: What she said was incoherent, even on its own terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In European democracies, the idea that immigration presents unique challenges for cultural solidarity has the attraction of being somewhat coherent. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something called “&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/islam-as-a-floating-signifier-right-wing-populism-and-perceptions-of-muslims-in-denmark/"&gt;Danish culture&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-biggest-problem-in-the-netherlands-understanding-the-party-for-freedoms-politicization-of-islam/"&gt;Dutch culture&lt;/a&gt;” that cuts across partisan divides and that mainstream center-left and center-right parties accept as broadly representative. This usually involves some commitment to liberal ideals such as gender equality, sexual freedom, and a neutral or “rational” public space. Accordingly, right-wing populist parties—and mainstream parties to various degrees—ask recent or prospective immigrants to accept, and even embrace, this national culture. Restrictionists in western Europe have, for instance, portrayed Muslim immigrants as hostile to gay people and sought, in the name of women’s rights, to limit a woman’s right to wear the head scarf. This aggressive, sometimes even coercive, insistence on liberal values leads right-wing populists to adopt illiberal positions—a sort of &lt;em&gt;illiberal liberalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, conservatives see a liberal political order—privileging nonnegotiable rights, personal freedom, and individual choice—as a threat to a historically imagined culture that no longer exists. If anything, the only consensus is that there is a &lt;a href="https://americanmind.org/features/the-crisis-of-american-national-identity/"&gt;lack of consensus&lt;/a&gt; over how to define the American creed. This complicates any new approach to immigration: In the absence of a shared understanding of American culture, whose conception of it would we privilege?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many national conservatives are either &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/liberalism-trump/553754/?utm_source=feed"&gt;illiberal or anti-liberal&lt;/a&gt;. If the United States is a liberal country—in the classical sense of elevating a liberal constitutional tradition—then should we make it more difficult for supporters of right-wing populist parties, such as Italy’s &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/muslims-in-the-west-and-the-rise-of-the-new-populists-the-case-of-italy/"&gt;League&lt;/a&gt; or Austria’s &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-new-right-austrias-freedom-party-and-changing-perceptions-of-islam/"&gt;Freedom Party&lt;/a&gt;, to immigrate to the United States? Across Europe, whites, being an ethnic majority, are more likely than nonwhites to hold to an ethnonationalist conception of the state. Accordingly, under a “cultural distance” immigration regime of the sort that Wax proposes, a Democrat could reasonably argue that white Europeans are &lt;em&gt;more likely&lt;/em&gt; to believe in things that are contrary to American ideals. One of those ideals is unrestricted birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the Constitution and, I &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/amy-chua-political-tribalism-book-overcome"&gt;would argue&lt;/a&gt;, is central to Americanness and the American idea. If a white European says he or she doesn’t support birthright citizenship—not a single European country currently has birthright citizenship—should that affect his or her chances of immigrating to the United States? Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony is that even supporters of Donald Trump would acknowledge that he is somewhat outside American cultural norms. For many, his flouting of norms and traditions is crucial to his appeal. (For opponents such as myself, it is perhaps his &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/muellers-no-collusion-conclusion-good-thing/586909/?utm_source=feed"&gt;only appeal&lt;/a&gt;.) He is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;like most of the Americans they know. Conservatives stress the importance of cultural cohesion, and pluralism, taken to extremes, can in fact undermine trust and produce civil conflict. But if a hypothetical white Swedish male with Trump’s exact views on Islam (“I think Islam hates us”), the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-defends-muslim-plan-by-comparing-himself-to-fdr/"&gt;internment&lt;/a&gt; of Japanese Americans, and sending minority congresswomen “back,” then that person would be more of a threat to U.S. cultural cohesion than, say, a nonwhite Ghanaian with views closer to those of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Or, to put a finer point on it, if Trump himself tried to (legally) immigrate to the United States, an immigration policy prioritizing culture—or, at least, what is currently the dominant culture—would probably have to reject his application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/public-policy-journal/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2018/11/16-S-Debating-Immigration-Restriction.pdf"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, Amy Wax favorably cites the late Samuel Huntington’s book &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Who-Are-We/Samuel-P-Huntington/9780684870540"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who Are We?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a sort of founding text for nationalist conservatives, but one that was pilloried upon its release in 2004. In &lt;a href="https://academy.wcfia.harvard.edu/publications/culture-matters-how-values-shape-human-progress"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Culture Matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a volume that he co-edited, Huntington defines culture “in purely subjective terms as the values, attitudes, beliefs, orientations, and underlying assumptions prevalent among people in a society.” Culture &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; subjective, which is part of the problem. We know cultures change, but less exactly how they change. Americans still do agree that Americanness is important. But they no longer agree, if they ever did, on what American culture or the American idea entails. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to measure any potential immigrant’s “cultural distance.” We cannot be a “who we are” nation if we don’t agree on who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/2kd8EqUD8jk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Shadi Hamid</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/shadi-hamid/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTX71Q30/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Loren Elliott / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Europeans Don’t Necessarily Share American Values</title><published>2019-08-01T05:45:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T09:07:18-04:00</updated><summary type="html">If Trump were an immigrant, the U.S. might not let him in.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/2kd8EqUD8jk/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/would-european-trump-share-american-cultural-values/595237/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595234</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;EDINBURGH—One afternoon in the early 1990s, the vice president of the European Parliament sat down to a congenial lunch at a Brussels restaurant with a young reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The parliamentarian was David Martin, a Scot and a member of the Labour Party who held his seat for 35 years, a run that &lt;a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/17666401.scotlands-longest-serving-mep-david-martin-loses-seat-after-labour-collapse/"&gt;finally ended&lt;/a&gt; in elections this past May. A Europhile, Martin neither questioned Scotland’s place within the United Kingdom, a formation that had held for hundreds of years, nor the U.K.’s place within the European Union, a newer alliance but seemingly an iron-cast certainty. Across the table sat Boris Johnson, who was assigned to cover the European Union for &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, acquiring on the way a reputation for concocting stories of overzealous Brussels administrators bringing in nonsensical regulations on matters such as the maximum size for condoms or the allowable curvature of a banana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Martin remembers finding Johnson a mildly amusing character. “I used to laugh at the kinds of stories Boris wrote,” he told me. “I assumed people would simply see the bent bananas in the shops and they would believe what their eyes were telling them. But they didn’t.” Instead, Johnson’s ascendancy continued almost unabated, with him eventually winning election to Parliament and the London mayoralty, and, most recently, becoming prime minister. Along the way, he led the campaign to pull Britain out of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Martin could hardly have foreseen how profoundly his own vision—one of a Scotland that flourished both within the U.K. and the EU—would be undone by his lunch companion, and the politics he came to embody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, many of the old certainties of Scottish politics no longer hold. It is a fraught, uncertain, and confusing period for politicians and voters alike, in which a landscape that once broadly divided along class lines has been reconfigured around two overlapping and profoundly polarizing constitutional questions: Scottish independence and Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/whats-the-worst-that-could-happen-if-scotland-leaves-the-uk/458118/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What's the worst that could happen if Scotland leaves the U.K.?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Martin, a widely respected figure and a pillar of Scotland’s involvement in the EU, is the latest casualty of this dilemma. He has long supported Scotland having a strong degree of autonomy from the British Parliament in London, but opposed outright independence. Now, with Britain due to leave the EU on October 31, remaining part of the U.K. and holding membership in the EU have begun to look more and more like mutually exclusive options for Scotland, rather than complementary ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The political calculus is shifting, and people like Martin are grappling with the fallout. “I have been in favour of the European Union and I have also been in favour of the U.K. union,” he &lt;a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scottish-labour-mep-calls-nicola-14198000"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Scottish tabloid, in March. “But I am just wondering if that U.K. union is worth saving anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The politics of Brexit are inseparable from the politics of what in Britain is referred to as devolution, or legislating powers away from London and to assemblies in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Scotland has its own legal, education, and health-care systems. In the three years since Britain voted to leave the EU, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/02/brexit-threatens-peace-northern-ireland-remain-eu/582970/?utm_source=feed"&gt;much of the focus&lt;/a&gt; has centered on Northern Ireland, a part of the U.K. and so destined to leave the bloc, and what will happen to its relationship with the Republic of Ireland, a separate state that will remain in the EU. There is no hard border between the two on the island of Ireland, and an arrangement between Brussels and London to safeguard peace by ensuring that the U.K. abides by EU customs arrangements until a permanent trade deal is made (meaning the border in Ireland could function as it does now) has been fiercely opposed by hard-line Brexit supporters who hold the balance of power at Westminster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The effect of Brexit on Scotland’s continued membership of the U.K. may be less pressing—Scotland has no land border with an EU member state, and has not experienced sectarian conflict on anything like the scale Ireland has—but the lingering question of Scottish independence has been completely reframed by the prospect of a meaningful border with England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/04/scotland-sturgeon-may-brexit-britain-independence/523623/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Brexit has brought the idea of Scottish independence back from the dead&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Scottish support for the EU has not always been so strong. The Scottish National Party (SNP) opposed Britain’s membership in the bloc during &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/07/31/the-referendums-of-1975-and-2016-illustrate-the-continuity-and-change-in-british-euroscepticism/"&gt;a previous referendum in 1975&lt;/a&gt; and the other major party here, Labour, did not take an official position, but from then on, Scots began to change their views. The Margaret Thatcher–led government in London carried out an intense period of privatization, leading to widespread closures and significant job losses in heavy industry. At roughly the same time, the EU began investing in Scotland, offering what the bloc calls “structural funds,” or money to poorer parts of the EU to help them catch up with richer areas, to areas where coal mines and steelworks had closed. The EU built infrastructure and industrial estates, and funded training programs. This was true not only in Scotland’s urbanized central belt, but in remote parts of the country such as the Highlands, too. Ewan Gibbs, a historian at the University of the West of Scotland, told me the EU provided “the means to navigate deindustrialization and transition to new forms of economic activity.” This was as much a question of identity as it was of economics: The term &lt;em&gt;industrial citizenship&lt;/em&gt; is used by scholars to describe the common bond felt by the many Scottish workers employed directly by U.K. state-owned institutions such as the National Coal Board and British Steel in the mid-20th century. As the government sold off these assets, the ties that had long held industrial working-class communities in Scotland to the broader U.K. began to fray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By the time of the 2016 referendum, every single council area in Scotland voted to remain in the EU. Overall, 62 percent of Scots &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results"&gt;favored&lt;/a&gt; continued EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Over the period from the 1970s onward, the twin factors of the EU’s greater role in Scotland and the devolution of powers to Edinburgh have helped bolster Scottish nationalism, which has gained in popularity. Martin sees this clearly. “Scottish nationalism is in part due to the strength of the EU,” he told me. “It weakens commitment to the U.K.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Scotland &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/results"&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of 55–45 to remain part of the U.K. in a 2014 independence referendum, a result that was supported by all of Britain’s political parties except the SNP and the Greens. But in allying with the Conservatives to oppose Scottish independence, Labour alienated a vast swath of its traditional supporters, and by the following year’s general election, it &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871"&gt;lost all but one&lt;/a&gt; of its 41 seats to the SNP. The Scottish nationalists have married a cautiously progressive policy platform and a technocratic style of government with a commitment to gaining independence. This has attracted support from a broad range of the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;How these various factors interact—from the terms on which Britain leaves the EU (still in doubt) to levels of support for Scottish independence (higher than in years past, but &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/scotland/boris-victory-will-end-union-lbmrc09vt"&gt;by no means&lt;/a&gt; an overwhelming majority) and the future status of Scotland’s border with England—will be crucial for determining the shape of Scotland’s relationship with its U.K. and European neighbors in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The long-running Brexit process has unraveled to the point where favoring a “no-deal” Brexit, one in which Britain leaves the EU without any agreement on the terms of its withdrawal, is no longer a fringe position. Johnson’s campaign for the Conservative party leadership was built on the promise of leaving without a deal on October 31 if no compromise is reached, and he has stacked his cabinet with hard-line euroskeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;All of this presents Scots with a litany of difficult choices. Trade and movement of people between Scotland and England, the most populous nation in the U.K., dwarfs that between Scotland and the rest of the EU. But leaving the EU would cause Scotland major difficulties, particularly in terms of trade. “As an exporting country,” Martin said, “any failure to have open access for goods like fresh seafood, food, and drink will seriously damage the Scottish economy. If there’s paperwork that gets it stuck for a couple of days, we’re in trouble.” The EU also provides Scotland with &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/felipeschrieberg/2019/01/16/no-deal-brexit-would-be-really-bad-for-scotch-whisky/#6a908e481920"&gt;legal protections for Scotch whisky&lt;/a&gt;, a key export and a distinct brand in international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Between the prospect of Brexit on the one hand and independence on the other, Scottish politics is mired in hypotheticals concerning what could happen were one or both of the major constitutional questions to be clearly resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-eu/594841/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: A new British prime minister faces the same old Brexit problem&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/20/nicola-sturgeon-make-scotlands-place-in-single-market-integral-to-talks"&gt;Proposals&lt;/a&gt; published by the Scottish government as early as 2016 outlined the possibility of a distinct form of Brexit for Scotland that could keep it within the European single market and the U.K. These proposals were largely ignored by Westminster, and Theresa May, Johnson’s predecessor as prime minister, kept consultation with devolved administrations to a bare minimum. The most resonant phrase in Scottish politics right now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicolasturgeon/status/1085264057299599361"&gt;repeated everywhere&lt;/a&gt;, is that Brexit will see Scotland &lt;em&gt;dragged out of Europe against our will&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;On the one hand, if the U.K. is able to leave the EU while retaining close alignment with the bloc on standards and regulations, this paradoxically makes it easier for Scotland to leave the U.K., because it could do so confident in the fact that it could join the EU and easily retain strong ties with the rest of Britain. But it would weaken the argument that Scotland needs to be independent in order to retain the benefits of EU membership. And if the U.K. were to leave without a deal, as Johnson has threatened, Edinburgh would then have to choose between maintaining close links with England (likely preserving the U.K.’s unity) and giving in to the political pressure the SNP would be under to push for full independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Scottish government has sought to build a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44237956"&gt;watertight case for independence&lt;/a&gt;, but has yet to push the button on another referendum for fear that a poorly timed poll could damage the nationalist cause for a generation. Brexit means that arguments for and against independence at any future vote will sound substantially different from those put forward in 2014, and the political battle lines may look different too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The constitutional chaos is a far cry from any scenario Martin could have envisioned over lunch with Johnson a quarter century ago in Brussels—he had been the European Parliament’s rapporteur on treaties that had laid down the legal basis for the future of the EU. Now, he must grapple with what is, for him, as a unionist and a Europhile, an impossible paradox. “If we have a hard Brexit,” he told me, “independence becomes more desirable but less achievable … If we have a softer Brexit, it becomes less pressing to leave the U.K., but more achievable to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/coO3q9nayWE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Elliot Ross</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/elliot-ross/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTX5B53R/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Russell Cheyne / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Demonstrators in Edinburgh protest against Brexit during a rally in March 2018.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Is Brexit Worth Scotland’s Independence?</title><published>2019-08-01T02:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T12:55:29-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Leaving the EU presents difficult choices for those on both sides of the Scottish-independence question.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/coO3q9nayWE/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/08/scottish-independence-and-brexit/595234/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595267</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the primary debates, Democratic candidates repeatedly accused each other of using “Republican talking points.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was Andrew Yang who actually deployed a hyper-conservative argument on Wednesday night—albeit one that had somehow time traveled from the year 2080.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked in very general terms about his climate-change plan, Yang, a former technology executive, made a few points. Almost all of them were terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The important number in this is 15 percent of global emissions,” Yang began, referring to the U.S. share of overall carbon pollution. “We like to act as if we’re 100 percent. Even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the Earth is going to get warmer. The last four years have been the four warmest years in history. We are too late. We are 10 years too late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Okay, let’s stop there. Yang is correct about a number of facts here. The United States does emit about 15 percent of the world’s carbon pollution. Even if the U.S. cut emissions now, the world would keep getting warmer. (That would be true even if the entire world cut carbon emissions, by the way—the thing about filling the atmosphere with &lt;em&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/em&gt; is that they will keep mindlessly capturing heat until they are absorbed or dissolve.) Yang is also right that some climate change is already baked in: The planet has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/how-climate-change-could-remake-every-biome-on-earth/569038/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: No ecosystem on Earth is safe from climate change&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang sees those facts, collectively, as a condemnation. “We are too late,” he intones. “We are 10 years too late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;With some due respect: What the hell? Yang has taken several nominally true sentences and strung them together into a dangerous argument. Sure, we’re too late to avoid some amount of climate change taking hold. We will need to adapt to climate change—and frankly, few leaders talk enough about adaptation. (Several candidates onstage last night, including Washington Governor Jay Inslee and former Vice President Joe Biden, have adaptation plans.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the game is not &lt;em&gt;lost. &lt;/em&gt;The planet could still follow a range of emission outcomes, including a not very bad one and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario/579700/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a catastrophic worst-case scenario&lt;/a&gt;. The worst, fastest sea-level rise seems like it may kick in between two and three degrees Celsius—and extraordinary action could yet hold that off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nor is the United States’ 15 percent share of global emissions reason for despair. First of all, the U.S. is the second-largest producer of carbon emissions. Second, there is a good response available to America’s emissions—and Yang, a former tech worker, should know it. The United States must develop decarbonization technologies here that can be sold or transferred to the rest of the world. That is why so many candidates stress the importance of R&amp;amp;D and why Inslee and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have talked about green manufacturing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was not the end of Yang’s argument. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction,” he continued, “but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground—and the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/climate-change-damaging-american-democracy/573769/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Climate change is already damaging American democracy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe I’m overreacting. Maybe Yang is just very good at staying on message. He is, after all, referring to his signature proposal, a universal basic income that would assure every American $1,000 a month. And, like, … sure … I guess. It is true—it is &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; true—that people who have more money will be less vulnerable to any one disaster. And people who are facing disaster should have more money. Protection from vulnerability is basically &lt;em&gt;what wealth is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But handing out money is not an adaptation policy. And $1,000 a month is not a good response to losing your house to higher sea levels, which is the malady Yang seems to be implying. It is certainly not &lt;em&gt;a collective adaptive approach to the challenge of climate change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Think about it this way. Asked about climate change on national television, Yang said that climate change is an inexorable problem, that the U.S. can’t do much of anything about it, and that if the seas take your house—that is, if a problem outside your control deprives you of your most expensive asset—then the government shouldn’t do anything specifically to help you. That is quite an argument. It does not strike me as one well chosen for a party whose voters care about climate change and who are moving to the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/WTakiADLtf4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_1158920676/lead_960.mpo"><media:credit>Jim Watson / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Andrew Yang made a surprisingly conservative argument about climate adaptation.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Andrew Yang Is Not Your Climate Friend</title><published>2019-08-01T00:05:19-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T09:14:22-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Fleeing to “higher ground” isn’t an adaptation policy.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/WTakiADLtf4/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/andrew-yangs-horrific-debate-answer-climate-change/595267/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595270</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Joe Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president? In case anyone watching the Democratic debate somehow forgot that fact, Biden repeatedly invoked Obama, and has elsewhere taken to referring to the “Obama-Biden administration” and “Obama-Biden Democrats.” But during tonight’s Democratic debate in Detroit, the ambivalence about the 44th president lurking within his party broke through. Although Democrats still love Obama, they now question central parts of his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clearest indication of this ambivalence came during an exchange about immigration. Biden had spent the first segment of the debate touting the Affordable Care Act and his role in creating it. Now he was facing tough questions about Obama’s record of deportations. Biden tried to squirm out of it, but he was eventually forced to answer. “I was vice president,” he said. “I’m not the president. I keep my recommendation in private.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was too much for Senator Cory Booker, who seemed to have been lying in wait for just this moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t have it both ways,” Booker said, turning to Biden. “You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can’t do it when it’s convenient and dodge it when it’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booker had a point, but Biden was hardly the only Democrat onstage to want it “both ways.” The candidates were all quick to praise Obama the man even as they seemed to be running against certain Obama policies—almost more than they were running against Trump. (Obama has avoided taking sides in the primary.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/obama-2020-election/590056/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Waiting for Obama&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On health care, for instance, the common denominator was dissatisfaction with the Affordable Care Act. Nearly every candidate agreed it did not go far enough or fast enough. They simply disagree on how fast to go and how best to get there in superseding it. When Senator Kamala Harris boasted that Kathleen Sebelius, an architect of the ACA and former secretary of health and human services, had endorsed her plan, Representative Tulsi Gabbard attacked Sebelius as a shill for the health-care industry. Even Senator Michael Bennet, staking out a moderate view, pressed for the public option for insurance that Obama rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden also conceded that the ACA needs updating. “Obamacare is working,” he said, adding: “The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and take back all the things that Trump took away and provide a public option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the former vice president sought to use Obama as a shield against attacks from rivals on racial-equality issues, including criminal-justice reform and school integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find it fascinating, everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues,” Biden said. “Barack Obama knew exactly who I was. He had 10 lawyers do a background check and everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties and he chose me and he said it was the best decision he made. I’ll take his judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Harris sought to weaponize Obama against Biden. Citing Biden’s praise for segregationist Democrats with whom he served early in his Senate career, Harris said, “Had those segregationists [had] their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate, Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate, and President Obama would not have been in a position to nominate him to the place he holds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julián Castro, who served as secretary of housing and urban development under Obama, also praised his old boss. “We have had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history,” Castro said. “Eighty months was due to President Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question to Biden about deportation—first asked by a moderator, but then pointedly brought up again by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio—was the closest that anyone onstage would get to criticizing Obama directly. Still, the candidates’ statements on health insurance and border security show that the critical consensus among Democratic presidential hopefuls has moved significantly to the left of Obama since he left office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History, and party policy, pass every former president by eventually. Bill Clinton might be willing to commiserate—if he’s gotten over Obama &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/05/05/bill-vs-barack"&gt;criticizing him in just the same way in 2008&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s surprising to see Obama almost discarded as a party asset, given that it’s been less than three years since he left office, and that he remains very popular—63 percent of Americans approve of him, Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/226994/obama-first-retrospective-job-approval-rating.aspx"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. More to the point, almost &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-legacy-2020-biden-poll_n_5cd32d5ee4b0a6cb31bc6113"&gt;nine in 10 Democrats approve of Obama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/democratic-voters-move-leftward-range-issues/574834/?utm_source=feed"&gt;is moving leftward&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a vocal faction in the primary in favor of more progressive policies. But it’s probably not a coincidence that the candidate who is tying himself most closely to the former president—Joe Biden—continues to lead the polls. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2008/01/likable-enough-005097"&gt;To borrow a phrase&lt;/a&gt;, it may be that Obama is still likable enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/jojg8Ji32hU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>David A.

The CNN moderators of tonight’s Democratic presidential debate had asked a question about fining companies that don’t fix pay inequities between men and women. When it was her turn to answer, the senator from New York turned to former Vice President Joe Biden and effectively accused him of being sexist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/joe-biden-op-ed.html"&gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt; a proposed expansion to the child tax credit. According to Gillibrand, Biden argued that&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“women working outside the home would ‘create the deterioration of family,’” and that “women who were working outside the home were ‘avoiding responsibility.’” She had always been a working woman, Gillibrand said, and the primary income-earner for her family. She demanded an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a long time ago,” Biden replied. He said he voted against the measure because he had opposed an expanded credit for high earners, but wanted to see a higher child tax credit now. “I support making sure that every single solitary person needing child care gets an $8,000 tax credit,” he said, claiming that would allow 700,000 women to reenter the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillibrand didn’t yield. This attack was planned: Days before the debate, she &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020.html"&gt;started alluding&lt;/a&gt; to an unnamed opponent in the presidential race who opposed women working outside the home. “Mr. Vice President,” she said, “you didn’t answer my question. What did you mean when you said, when a woman works outside the home, it’s resulting in ‘the deterioration of family’?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Biden hit back. “I wrote the Violence Against Women Act,” he said, citing a number of other legislative efforts he has worked on over the years to promote women’s advancement. Gillibrand had applauded him in the past, he said: “I don’t know what happened, except you’re running for president.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Biden had a point. Although Gillibrand was trying to intimate that Biden wasn’t a good-faith supporter of women, her own Twitter feed betrays her. “Thank you VP Biden,” she wrote in October 2016, “for your unwavering commitment to combating violence against women!” There’s even a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VP&lt;/a&gt; Biden for your unwavering commitment to combating violence against women! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsOnUs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ItsOnUs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCvXfTsVIk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCvXfTsVIk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/2020-democrats-abortion/590701/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Gillibrand led the attack against Biden’s longtime support for the Hyde Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits federal funding for most abortion procedures. (Under pressure, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/biden-abortion-hyde/591241/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Biden recently reversed his stance&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Progressive women voters have been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/the-2018-midterms-belong-to-women/575140/?utm_source=feed"&gt;key players&lt;/a&gt; in mobilization efforts against President Donald Trump, whom they see as dangerously sexist. Tonight Gillibrand tried to paint Biden as similarly regressive. This time, her attack didn’t work so well. But this likely won’t be the last time Biden has to defend his record on women’s issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/b9c-iuMbpyM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Emma Green</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-green/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GillibrandBiden/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jim Watson / AFP /Getty</media:credit><media:description>Kirsten Gillibrand made Joe Biden answer for a past op-ed on women in the workplace.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Kirsten Gillibrand Targets Biden’s Views on Women</title><published>2019-07-31T23:02:08-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T12:53:19-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The senator from New York tried to paint the former vice president as regressive, tapping into bigger questions about the Democratic Party’s identity heading into 2020.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/b9c-iuMbpyM/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/gillibrand-biden-women/595264/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595261</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was never really a question whether busing would come up during night two of the second round of Democratic presidential&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;debates in Detroit. Senator Kamala Harris of California and Vice President Joe Biden stood next to each other for a redux of the confrontation they had the last time they shared the debate stage. The exchange went as expected. Biden demurred, arguing that his record was not what Harris suggested it was, and that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing/593623/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the two had views on busing&lt;/a&gt; that weren’t far apart. Harris countered, saying that Biden worked with segregationists on legislation that was harmful to black children when it mattered most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Biden and Harris were cut off by the moderator, the conversation veered away for a moment. Then Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado spoke up and pulled the conversation out of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the weeds. “This is the fourth debate that we have had, and the second time that we have been debating what people did 50 years ago with busing, when our schools are as segregated as they were 50 years ago,” Bennet said. “We need a conversation about what’s happening now, and when there’s a group of kids in this country that don’t get preschool through no fault of their own and another group does—equal is not equal,” he exclaimed. “We’ve got a group of K–12 schools that are good because families can spend a million bucks, and you got the Detroit public schools that are as segregated as they were.” He repeated the mantra—&lt;em&gt;Equal is not equal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is ironic that the Democratic candidates would be onstage, once again, discussing school desegregation in Detroit a week after the 45th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Milliken v. Bradley&lt;/em&gt;, the Supreme Court decision that has limited the tools the federal government can use to desegregate America’s schools. The case dealt with the desegregation of the public schools in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democratic debates, in showy fashion, have highlighted school segregation—not only its past, but its present. But anyone searching for substantive details about the candidates’ plans for desegregating America’s schools will be left wanting. At least one candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has offered a plan—what he calls the Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public Education—to address school segregation, but it is the exception, not the rule. Both Biden and Harris are wary of federally mandated school desegregation by way of busing. And neither Bennet, Biden, nor Harris has a plan listed on their campaign website to deal with segregated schools. The acknowledgment that &lt;em&gt;equal is not equal&lt;/em&gt; today in the United States is an important step. But to make equal equal would take more than talk.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/CvdVmlAQNUI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Adam Harris</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/adam-harris/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_1165427677/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Scott Olson / Getty</media:credit><media:description>Senator Michael Bennet onstage at the Democratic presidential debates in Detroit, Michigan</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Bennet Steals the Moment From Harris and Biden on School Segregation</title><published>2019-07-31T22:45:56-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T12:52:34-04:00</updated><summary type="html">But it will take more than just talk to fix America's schools.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/CvdVmlAQNUI/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/07/harris-biden-bennet-school-segregation-busing/595261/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595255</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Senator Cory Booker has been waiting for this chance for six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Democrat, despite having a bigger national profile than many of his rivals in the Democratic primary, has languished in the polls—starved for attention, outshone by competitors both older and younger, and grasping for any kind of traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During tonight’s second primary debate, he finally got a clear shot to capture America’s attention, courtesy of former Vice President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like others trying to knock Biden out of his top spot in the race, Booker has criticized his competitor’s authorship of the 1994 crime bill, which progressives blame for exacerbating mass incarceration in the United States. He’s also faulted Biden’s more recent proposals for criminal-justice reform as inadequate. Tonight Biden tried to minimize his differences with Booker, saying his plan was “similar” to the senator’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booker wasn’t having it. “This is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws,” he told Biden, who stood next to him onstage in Detroit. “And you can’t just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden, in fitting with his feisty style, escalated his critique by calling out Booker’s record as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. He accused Booker of overseeing a police department that engaged in stop-and-frisk, a tactic that’s been widely denounced as racial profiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booker beamed, waiting for his turn to respond. “If you want to compare records—and I’m shocked that you do—I am happy to do that,” he said, drawing laughter from the crowd. “Because all the problems that he is talking about that he created, I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damages that your bills” created. “You were bragging,” Booker added, “calling it the ‘Biden crime bill’ up until 2015.” Booker was referring to the First Step Act, a bipartisan prison-reform bill that President Donald Trump signed last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/biden-harris-attack/595210/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Joe Biden enters attack mode&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duel was a mismatch—a contest between two students who had done the class reading but with only one who was quick on his feet. When Biden tried again to hit Booker for his record in Newark, Booker essentially called him out for reciting a talking point from an opposition-research briefing book and speaking about a subject he didn’t fully know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a saying in my community that you’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor,” Booker snapped, again drawing laughs. “You need to come to the city and see the reforms we put in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten-person debates are a poor format for fully litigating policy disputes and historical records, and whether it’s fair or not, visuals and delivery often matter more—at least in the moment. And on that score, Booker clearly prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had already cut Biden down once before, accusing the front-runner of having it “both ways” by clinging to Barack Obama’s legacy while disavowing the former president’s heavy-handed use of deportations early in his first term. “You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign,” Booker said. “You can’t do it when it’s convenient and dodge it when it’s not.” (He then shocked the Fox Theatre crowd by invoking Trump’s infamous description of African nations as “shithole countries”—demonstrating in the process that CNN was not broadcasting with a seven-second profanity delay.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Booker’s well-landed parries and punches, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/biden-harris-attack/595210/?utm_source=feed"&gt;had a stronger performance tonight&lt;/a&gt; than he did in June, and whether Booker can translate this debate into a substantial rise in the polls is as yet unknown. But these early debates are far more important for the long shots than the front-runners. Biden has already secured his spot in the next round of debates in the fall, and he’s likely ensured a place onstage until voting starts next year. Booker’s position is considerably more precarious, and for his own immediate prospects, the strength he showed tonight could be that much more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/H76w6dlM88s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Russell Berman</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/russell-berman/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/BookerBiden/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jim Watson / AFP /Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Cory Booker Exposed a Key Biden Weakness</title><published>2019-07-31T22:28:51-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T22:54:11-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The senator from New Jersey finally got a clear shot to capture America’s attention tonight by going after the former vice president’s criminal-justice record.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/H76w6dlM88s/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/cory-booker-democratic-debate-biden-criminal-justice/595255/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595216</id><content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;Democrats know they’re against President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, which have included crackdowns on illegal crossings at the southern border, and his rhetoric, which has demonized people from other countries. But the top 2020 Democratic candidates at tonight’s debate could not agree on how to approach the most fundamental question about American immigration: whether the government should be able to enforce its borders at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden, the current Democratic front-runner, was the clear target for a series of attacks from the more progressive candidates onstage tonight. Throughout his campaign, Biden has played up his association with President Barack Obama, seeing it as his best advantage. But in this case, Biden’s opponents cited Obama’s immigration policies, which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/opinion/sunday/trump-deportations-immigration.html"&gt;included a significant hike in deportations&lt;/a&gt;, as a black mark. “You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign,” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said, addressing Biden. “You can’t do it when it’s convenient and dodge it when it’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/trump-debate-democrats-detroit/595066/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: The Democrats’ visceral fear of losing to Donald Trump]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of tonight’s candidates endorsed a change in the way illegal crossings are treated under the law, arguing that they should be civil violations rather than criminal ones. “The criminal courts [are] giving Donald Trump the ability to violate the human rights of people coming to our country,” Booker said. Processing illegal crossings in civil courts would eliminate the need for the “awful detention facilities that I’ve been to, seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children,” he added. Several of his colleagues in the Senate, including Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California, agreed with this approach—and pointedly called out Biden for his role in an administration that took a far tougher stance on enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden became defensive. “The fact of the matter is, when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they’re seeking asylum,” he said. “People should have to get in line.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Later, when other candidates pushed him to say whether he had encouraged Obama not to pursue deportations, he effectively pleaded the Fifth, saying that his counsel to the former president was private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/democratic-debate-moral-issues/595072/?utm_source=feed"&gt;[Read: Democrats make the case that they’re the moral party]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions about immigration pose a difficult challenge for Democrats as they approach an election cycle in which Trump will likely double down on his opposition to illegal immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the debate tonight, Trump tweeted about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;The cages for kids were built by the Obama Administration in 2014. He had the policy of child separation. I ended it even as I realized that more families would then come to the Border! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156742970105892864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;This claim is not true: &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/10/trump-digs-false-claim-that-he-stopped-obamas-family-separation-policy/?utm_term=.500d6e3fee45"&gt;Family separations were rare under Obama&lt;/a&gt;, while the Trump administration actively pursued a separation policy. And &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/migrant-family-separations.html"&gt;separations have continued&lt;/a&gt;, despite the Trump administration’s claims that it had suspended the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, and his Republican allies, have painted Democrats as effectively supporting open borders, with no limits on how many immigrants should be admitted to the country, and no enforcement against those who have entered illegally. These kinds of policies may be popular among progressive activists, but Democratic voters &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/wisconsin-democrats-immigration-policy.html"&gt;tend to hold more moderate views&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s position—that immigration is generally good, but it should happen legally—has been common among Democrats even in recent years. His progressive opponents, however, are pushing a far more expansive view of how immigrants should be welcomed to America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue will require a tricky balance for whichever Democrat tops the ticket in 2020. The party, including longtime leaders like Biden, is united in its condemnation of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/send-her-back-battle-will-define-us-forever/594307/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Trump’s rhetoric against immigrants and asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt;. While that moral stand is clear, the way it should translate into policy is much more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the intra-party debate is already ugly. Progressive candidates for president are arguing that any kind of criminal enforcement against illegal immigration is effectively siding with Trump. As former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro said to Biden, “It looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/4WfBbBpKvhc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Emma Green</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-green/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/Castro/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jim Watson / AFP / Getty</media:credit><media:description>Julian Castro (left) had strong words for Joe Biden (far right) about immigration policy.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Democrats Battle Over the Past and Present of Immigration</title><published>2019-07-31T22:10:31-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T22:37:24-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The 2020 presidential candidates know they’re against Donald Trump, but they are sharply divided over what kind of enforcement should be used at the border.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/4WfBbBpKvhc/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/castro-biden-immigration-debate/595216/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595252</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you ask the Democratic candidates for president who is to blame for Americans’ health-care predicament, they swiftly jab their fingers at health-insurance companies. Sure, pharmaceutical companies have received some mention (mostly negative) in the Democratic debates, but so far, insurance companies have been painted as greedy money-grubbers that just don’t want Americans to have health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Senator Kamala Harris blamed insurance companies for Americans going bankrupt. “Insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long,” she said. “American families have [been] held down by deductibles and co-pays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/hospital-bills-medical-debt-bankruptcy/584998/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Americans are going bankrupt from getting sick&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, Senator Elizabeth Warren said, “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/31/transcript-first-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.f70ad132a202"&gt;The basic profit&lt;/a&gt; model of an insurance company is taking as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health-care coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In last month’s debate, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/27/transcript-night-one-first-democratic-debate-annotated/?utm_term=.8efc72fe7c57"&gt;Mayor Bill De Blasio said&lt;/a&gt;, “Private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out-of-pocket expenses.” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand blamed “the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies,” and Senator Bernie Sanders proclaimed, “The function of the health-care system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Biden has even threatened to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/what-biden-said-during-democratic-debate/592906/?utm_source=feed"&gt;jail insurance executives&lt;/a&gt;—twice, at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/06/what-biden-said-during-democratic-debate/592906/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Biden’s odd slip of the tongue&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s true that high-deductible plans are one reason people get high medical bills in the first place. And it’s also fair to say that insurers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/05/25/613685732/why-your-health-insurer-doesnt-care-about-your-big-bills" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;don’t always negotiate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for the lowest prices they can, and that they make healthy profits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in fact, the types of medical bills that lead to medical bankruptcy most commonly stem from out-of-network emergency-room visits and planned surgeries, not co-pays and premiums, experts told me &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/hospital-bills-medical-debt-bankruptcy/584998/?utm_source=feed"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Insurance companies do have networks, and services that are out of network are billed a higher rate. But doctors and hospitals decide whether to participate in certain insurers’ networks, and whether to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/05/the-agony-of-surprise-medical-bills/393785/?utm_source=feed"&gt;bill patients&lt;/a&gt; for the balance of their bills (and, later, whether to &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/methodist-le-bonheur-healthcare-sues-poor-medical-debt"&gt;sue patients&lt;/a&gt; for that balance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentiment behind the anti-insurance talk is understandable. The most frustrating part of many Americans’ interactions with the health-care system is trying to get their insurance claims paid. No one enjoys hearing that something isn’t covered or will cost more than anticipated, and insurers are often the bearers of that news. And certainly, insurers &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16906558/anthem-emergency-room-coverage-denials-inappropriate"&gt;also have money-saving tricks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.statnews.com/2019/06/17/ghost-networks-psychiatrists-hinder-patient-care/"&gt;up their sleeves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the profits of health insurers are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-health-insurance/2017/06/30/0136f34e-5cd2-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html?utm_term=.72490f830c9b"&gt;not that exorbitant&lt;/a&gt; compared with other parts of the health-care system. And in fact, many scholars suggest that American health care &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89"&gt;is so dysfunctional&lt;/a&gt; because it simply costs too much. That’s the fault of doctors, drugmakers, and hospitals, too, not just insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are Democrats so focused on insurers, rather than providers and hospitals? Perhaps it’s because &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000021819&amp;amp;year=2018"&gt;America’s Health Insurance Plans&lt;/a&gt;, the health insurers’ trade group, is not as big of a lobbying spender as the &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000116&amp;amp;year=2019"&gt;American Hospital Association&lt;/a&gt;. In a less cynical interpretation, doctors and hospitals at least appear to &lt;em&gt;do stuff&lt;/em&gt; in exchange for their fees, while health insurers can more easily be written off as pure middlemen. Or maybe it’s just because so many Democrats are pushing Medicare for All, which would effectively eliminate insurance companies. It’s easier to do away with something you’ve already painted as a useless money-grubber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/Mkcox2dkWaI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</content><author><name>Olga Khazan</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/olga-khazan/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_1158920769/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jim Watson / AFP /Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Why Won’t Democrats Blame Hospitals?</title><published>2019-07-31T22:09:54-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T08:09:14-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Democratic presidential candidates paint insurers as the health-care bogeymen, letting providers off the hook.</summary><link href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/Mkcox2dkWaI/" rel="alternate" /><feedburner:origLink>https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/07/kamala-harris-blames-health-insurers-she-right/595252/?utm_source=feed</feedburner:origLink></entry></feed>
