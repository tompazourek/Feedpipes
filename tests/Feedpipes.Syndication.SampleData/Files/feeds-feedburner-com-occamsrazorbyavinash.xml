								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everything a company does works out.</p>
<p>(That is different from everything that a company is doing not working out. :))</p>
<p>If you are in the <em>data business</em> &#8211; my bread, butter and tofu – you often carry the burden of being the bearer of bad news.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><em>The conversion rate is down 30% at launch.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal was to deliver a 30% increase in revenue, the team delivered 1.7953%.</em></p>
<p><em>During 2019, our Net Promoter Score has dropped 15 points.</em></p>
<p><em>The average length of our video ads is 30 seconds, less than 10% of the audiences watches beyond 5 seconds and 90% is exposed to less than 1 second.</em></p>
<p><em>Our Market Share in the 2-ton truck market shrunk by 1.5% (= -$3 bil).</em></p>
</div>
<p>Negative data.</p>
<p>Accurately collected. Intelligently analyzed. Factually presented.</p>
<p>Sadly still, negative data to the person/team receiving it.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">Why be hurtin’?</font></strong></p>
<p>A decade ago, <em>data people</em> delivered a lot less bad news because so little could be measured with any degree of confidence.</p>
<p>In 2019, we can measure the crap out of so much. Even with the limitations of tools, government regulations, and the astonishing fragmentation of everything (attention, devices, consumption sources, identities and more).</p>
<p>Companies have also evolved to be significantly more complex beings, who have to do so much more than what they did 50 years ago. Think of all P&amp;G had to do to sell soap 50 years ago, and now reflect on the baffling array of things they have to do today to sell a bar of soap. Add on top of that, where P&amp;G could sell soap, the purposes it could sell soap for, and imagine both of those things now. It is a lot of stuff!</p>
<p>When you do that much stuff, and you can measure almost everything… The result is that our ecosystem of <em>data people</em> are returning a lot more negative data when measuring performance of <strong>Marketing, Sales, User Experience and Customer Service</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me repeat this one more time: It is not that companies have slowly over the last decade started to suck more (well, maybe some). It is that we are able to analyze and identify bad performance with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>While that change has occurred, two things have obstinately stayed the same:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><strong><font color="#008000">1.</font></strong> Company cultures are rarely open to hearing anything negative.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">2.</font></strong> The top leaders in your company grew up, succeeded, and were promoted during the era of no data (and hence a ton less negative news). They are not natively wired to receive data-delivered reality checks.</p>
</div>
<p>The combination means no red carpet for negative data. It is not hard to see that a modern large corporation is likely missing out on the benefits of all they should know about their business through data. It also results in a depressing existence for <em>data people</em>.</p>
<p>Short-term, this <em>let’s not listen to the negative data </em>strategy sometimes actually works. No one is telling the Emperor he is naked, and the Emperor is delighted everyone loves his clothes so much.</p>
<p>Long-term…. : (</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">Four <em>Negative Data</em> Leadership Archetypes.</font></strong></p>
<p>The solutions to this big opportunity have many dimensions. </p>
<p>I want to focus on the massive “make or break” dimension: #2 above, with Extremely Senior Leaders (ESLs).</p>
<p>Through their words and actions, ESLs can quash data&#039;s <em>learn to improve</em> spirit, or they can nurture that spirit and deliver a transformative, positive impact on the company&#039;s culture + profit.</p>
<p>In my work with clients around the world (all continents except Antarctica), I’ve encountered a whole host of reactions to when I have shared negative data with ESLs. From the patterns in those reactions, I’ve developed four archetypes of leaders. </p>
<p>While people are never starkly black and white, they typically have a dominant archetype – the one they most frequently demonstrate.</p>
<p>I’ve also observed cultural implications that each leader-type ends up creating from their reactions to negative data. For three of the four, I’ve seen individuals successfully navigate the leader-type – never without scars though – and individuals emotionally burn-out due the environment the leader creates. </p>
<p>Today, I want share the four leader archetypes with negative data as the lens. Included below is my accumulated wisdom, with the hope that you’ll fall in navigate category and not the crushed one.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Archetype #1: The Bubble King (/Queen).</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #1:<strong> How they react:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>This individual lives in a bubble, so their reaction to any data is… Nothing. Data, unless it is super-positive, never makes it to them. Bubble Kings are comfortable making decisions that <em>sound good</em> – decisions just as likely to be informed by their long experience as the quest for shiny objects.</p>
<p>Bubble Kings most commonly reside in organizations where there is little to no accountability (or misplaced accountability, ex: celebration of vanity metrics).</p>
<p>Their most common reaction to negative data, if it makes it through, is to try to discredit it by asking analytically-nonsensical questions: <em>What are the p-values of your multi-channel attribution model applied to performance of my strategy?</em></p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #1:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>Cultural implications:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>In small or medium sized companies, Bubble Kings (/Queens) have short reigns. Not all that hard to imagine why – you don’t listen to data, ignore reality checks, and the transparently oriented accountability loop ensures there is nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>In large companies, or teams with massive budgets, Bubble Kings (/Queens) have long reigns. The accountability loops are larger, less transparent, and the natural large-company multi-layer organization complexity does not help. Typically a change in the C-Suite layer above will transition them out of the company (fresh eyes, sunshine … call it what you will).</p>
<p>However, while they still reign &#8211; since feelings matter more than data &#8211; sycophantic behavior is common and often encouraged.</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #1:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>How to deal with them, their org:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Data will never play any impactful role on strategy. Since Bubble Kings live in a, well, bubble, you can often form relationships and influence at lower levels in a Bubble King’s org, and you can have a positive influence on tactics. Absolutely take advantage of it.</p>
<p>If you want to get promoted, give up the quest to identify factual real-world performance and focus instead on proving that the Bubble King&#039;s decisions deliver excellent results. Don&#039;t compromise on your ethics. But on this blog and in my newsletter I’ve shared enough strategies you should not use to slant data – use them.</p>

</div>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Archetype #2: The Attacker.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #2:<strong> How they react:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>They attack.</p>
<p>They attack the data. They attack your knowledge. They attack your intent. They bring up that one time in 2013 when your analysis missed an important assumption. They attack your personal attributes.</p>
<p>In the face of factual negative data related to their decisions, they will counter-attack. At times, harshly. Sometimes they counter-attack, in a twist of irony, by trying to drown you in enormous detail and minutiae.</p>
<p>You will be branded Ms. Bad News or Mr. Not A Team Player or some such ugly moniker.</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #2:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>Cultural implications:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>In extremely senior positions, Attackers fuel the creation of a culture where no bad news ever filters through. When business performance is non-positive, every employee, at every level, will work super-duper hard to look at every dimension of data to find any semblance of good news (no matter how small). Only this good news will make it to the top (Attacker ESL).</p>
<p>A typical example: The entire house is on fire but the analysis of that situation will focus on the one unsinged rose in the font lawn and how beautiful the rose is.</p>
<p>Attackers lead can last for a surprisingly long time in an organization, for a whole host of strategic reasons (as I’m confident you’ve observed as well).</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #2:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>How to deal with them, their org:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>If you are a <em>data person</em> and you are in a <strong>small organization</strong> lead by an Attacker, you need to update your resume and find a way out. There is no hope for your career (or emotional positivity).</p>
<p>If you are a <em>data person</em> and you are in a <strong>large organization</strong> lead by an Attacker, also update your resume. If, for any number of valid reasons, you are stuck there my advice is to focus your analytical efforts exclusively on the Attacker&#039;s biggest fears. It might take a little bit of effort to discover them, but it is so worth it. Even an Attacker has a point at which their instinct for self-preservation kicks in, in those rare (often hidden) situations they’ll be open to negative data.</p>
<p>And this is key: If you can provide solutions and not just data, you might even become a trusted adviser. This will do nothing to advance your acquired negative branding of Ms. Bad News, nor will this change the broader team/company culture… But…You&#039;ll have an impact with data, providing a pretty decent existence in an Attacker created culture while you look for a way out. </p>
</div>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Archetype #3: The Rationalizer.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #3:<strong> How they react:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Their trigger instinct in face of factual negative data is to make excuses. To provide <em>context</em>. To identify <em>circumstances to blame</em>. To poke holes in the data/methodology (regardless of the Rationalizer’s analytical competence). To create enough uncertainty to fuzzy up any negative &#8211; or remotely negative &#8211; data.</p>
<p>If we were stack rank the four types, the Rationalizer would come on top as the most undesirable leader (often corrosive for the institution).</p>
<p>You might think it would be the Attacker. It is the Rationalizer because their approach to dealing with negative data is not as overtly corrosive. A Rationalizer subtly sows doubt. They dilute the analysis with non-facts. They force the inclusion of non-related nonsense in the quest to<em> paint a fuller picture</em>. At their worst, they commonly turn diamonds into coal.</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #3:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>Cultural implications:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Everything <em>data people</em> do to highlight reality, to bring truth to the fore, to identify positive solutions from negative data, will be discounted, buried, and compete for impact with faith. Questionable analysis and slanted views will have equal footing with the most factual and intelligent analysis.</p>
<p>When people say &quot;this team’s culture runs on BS,&quot; they are describing an organizations run by a Rationalizer.</p>
<p>Status quo will rule the day in such organizations, unless there is a big external force that creates change. The operative instinct is to maintain mediocrity with just enough <em>reality massaging</em> flowing upstream to ensure existing mediocrity is not utterly obvious.</p>
<p>One identifying attribute of Rationalizer organizations is the overwhelming abundance of data pukes. Why? Data pukes do nothing to make an organization intelligent, while providing the feeling of competence and productive output.</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #3:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>How to deal with them, their org:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Rationalizer org’s are hardest to deal with because you are not obviously being ignored (Bubble King) nor are you being openly challenged (Attacker). You are just constantly being undercut to the point where the data represents a watered down version of an adjacent reality.</p>
<p>If you are a <em>data person</em> full of courage and determination, find the largest element of the business&#039; strategy and unpack the power of strategic analysis to present factual data. Lead with as many things as you can find that are going right, then follow that with the <strong>most material two</strong> things that are factually not going right. Present the collection directly to the Rationalizer if you can.</p>
<p>On that note… Since the Rationalizer is an ESL (Extremely Senior Leader), it is quite possible that you have to work through many layers of people in-between you, my peer <em>data person</em>, and them. In a Rationalizer’s culture, every layer you go through will instinctively take the <strong>material two </strong>negative news and will try to kill it or <em>fuzzify/massage </em>it. In these cases, if you can make cosmetic changes to pass each layer, do so. Don&#039;t give up on the core of the positive and negative stories. </p>
<p>When you are in the presence of a Rationalizer, bring overwhelming analytical competence – there is no better way to deal with their reactions (see above). A Rationalizer never gives up trying to rationalize every small bit of negative data, persistence is a virtue that’ll come in handy.</p>
<p>Keep in close contact with your soul. At some point you’ll find it is sapping, it’ll be your clue that you need to find it a different professional environment.</p>
</div>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Archetype #4: The Curious One.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #4:<strong> How they react:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>In face of negative data, the Curious One asks you questions to understand the <em>why </em>behind <em>what </em>you are presenting.</p>
<p>If a period has elapsed where the <em>data person </em>has demonstrated competence, the Curious One does not question the analytical approach of data collection methodologies (they trust you to have applied fanatical quality control). The Curious One demonstrates, well, curiosity about what biases might be in the data or what assumptions you might have made.</p>
<p>They have two critical attributes:<strong> 1.</strong> They demonstrate open mindedness in the face of negative data. <strong>2.</strong> Their posture is not to instinctively blame (backwards looking), but rather the posture is to identify and fix (forwards looking).</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #4:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>Cultural implications:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Due to the demonstrated behavior at the top, open mindedness is usually encouraged in organizations led by Curious Ones.</p>
<p>Negative data is never a delightful experience, but the trust fostered amongst senior leaders results in a lot more truth telling, and is as good of a welcome mat as will ever be provided to the <em>data people</em>.</p>
<p>It might seem odd that in such a positive posture to negative data that there is still accountability, but incredibly in my experience it exists in spades in such organizations. It flows down from the clear measurable goals, an empowered data organization, and a close and direct partnership with different leadership levels (VPs, Directors, Sr. Managers).</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#3e802b">Archetype #4:<strong> </strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>How to deal with them, their org:</strong></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Pinch yourself every day.</p>
<p>Don&#039;t take your position for granted. Invest in self-learning every week &#8211; even couple hours a week &#8211; to ensure you can keep pace with the demands for sophisticated analysis which will be expected at an agile pace.</p>
<p>You know my <strong>Care-Do-Impact</strong> model for analysis and storytelling. Organizations led by the Curious Ones are the very best places for you to slowly migrate your sophistication in <strong>Do</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong>. This, in turn, means that your demonstrated sophistication will open up new career options, for example becoming a business line leader or moving on to the strategy side of the house. Joyous outcomes for you, your company, and your company&#039;s customers.</p>
</div>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">Two Inspiring Examples | Curious One Archetype.</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Paul Polman.</font></strong></p>
<p>One person who demonstrated Curious One behavior to me was the recently ex-Global CEO of Unilever, <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulPolman">Paul Polman</a>. I had an opportunity to spend time with him and his leadership team. My role was to be a challenger, to share stories about what Unilever did well and focus on the challenges faced by vividly demonstrating things they did not do well. The latter part of the story qualifies as <em>negative data.</em></p>
<p>It would be normal CEO behavior to be defensive, to pick the story apart, to make excuses. But, no. Through his words and actions to me and his brand CEOs, Mr. Polman demonstrated every attribute of the Curious One. This opened mind share required to re-imagine the future.</p>
<p>As with inspiring leaders, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Polman">there is a whole ton lot more</a> as to why I admire Mr. Polman.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Alan Mulally.</font></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Mulally’s stewardship of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally">Boeing and Ford is legendary</a>. I want to share one story that Mr. Mulally shared with us in a meeting (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Icon-Mulally-Fight-Company/dp/0307886069/?tag=occsrazbyavik-20">and in his book</a>).</p>
<p>When he got to Ford he instilled the same <em>colored charts</em> approach to identify what&#039;s working and what needs more attention. All the charts Mr. Mulally got were color coded green (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#everythingisawesome</a>). The problem was that Ford was on track to lose $17 billion dollars that year. Ford&#039;s culture was such that business leaders would hide problems, therefore making issues &quot;disappear.&quot; Mr. Mulally set a different tone of honesty and looking at negative data as an opportunity to improve/change/fix (classic Curious One approach). In next meetings, things slowly started to turn Red… and Yellow… and some real Green.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to Mr. Mulally&#039;s turnaround of Ford. Eleven principles actually (buy the book!). But in this anecdote you can see the central reason that I adore him, and the leadership skills that can turn even the most intractable business problems in some of the largest companies on the planet.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">A Plan for Action.</font></strong></p>
<p>Humans are complicated beings.</p>
<p>No individual is just one black and white type.</p>
<p>Yet, humans, at least professionally, tend to demonstrate a dominant type. It is what they are natively comfortable with.</p>
<p>With that in mind, a suggestion for a plan of action…</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Leader.</font></strong></p>
<p>Introspective is in order. Assume you are doing this only for your own selfish benefit reasons, no one else has to know.<font color="#3e802b">*</font> </p>
<p>Take a quiet moment.</p>
<p>Reflect on what your dominant type is: Bubble King or Attacker or Rationalizer or Curious one.</p>
<p>Once you do that, consider the impact that your leadership posture is having on your team, on your <em>data people</em>, on the ability of negative data (or negative anything) to help stop/rethink strategy, and indeed on the corporation.</p>
<p>The global maxima is that you consider a personal shift towards exploring the benefits of evolving to become the Curious One type (if you are not there already).</p>
<p>An incentive is that at some point in a long career, one does tend to reflect on the personal impact of one&#039;s professional accomplishments. In that moment, on that day/week/month/rest of your life, realizing the heart-breaking impact you delivered by being a Bubble King, Attacker or Rationalizer does deliver a heavy emotional burden and a personal crisis. So. Not. Worth it.</p>
<p>There is a meme that people can&#039;t really change who they are. You&#039;d be surprised how untrue that is.</p>
<p><font color="#3e802b">* </font>Your team already knows what type you are. You might as well be honest with yourself for all the benefits that will come.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800040">Individual.</font></strong></p>
<p>Self-reflection is in order for you as well.</p>
<p>Set some quiet time aside so that you can consider the <em>how they react</em> and <em>cultural implications</em> demonstrated by the leader who has the biggest influence your personal work. (Sometimes this is your direct manager. Other times it is someone a few levels above yours.)</p>
<p>In your mind only, assign the archetype (BK, A, R, CO) to the leader. That act will bring clarity as you ask yourself these three questions I recommend&#8230;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>What is your behavior in response to that dominant leader?</p>
<p>Is it as suggested in the <em>how to deal </em>with it section of each leader type?</p>
<p>What will it take for you to change your behavior to <em>optimally deal with</em> the situation you are in?</p>
</div>
<p>Make a specific plan.</p>
<p>Act on it. Life is short.</p>
<p>It is always better to be on a path chosen after careful self-reflection and planning, even if you find yourself in an undesirable situation. It might not deliver world peace, but it will reduce your emotional burden.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">Bottom-line.</font></strong></p>
<p>We&#039;ve used leader reaction to negative data as a vehicle to discuss creating an optimal professional path for ourselves (as leaders or as individuals).</p>
<p>The framework I&#039;ve shared, <em>how they react</em>, <em>cultural implication</em>, and <em>how to deal with it</em>, can be applied to multiple dimensions of our professional ecosystem. Give it a try.</p>
<p>If you are a leader, if you have a choice, be the Curious One. Here are a recap of the benefits: <font color="#3e802b"><strong>1.</strong></font> Lighter personal emotional burden. <font color="#3e802b"><strong>2.</strong></font> Cultures where the goal is not blame, it is making progress. <font color="#3e802b"><strong>3.</strong></font> People who love you (yes, love, in a workplace!) and will help you deliver transformative results – in good times and bad. </p>
<p>So. Worth. It.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>As always, it is your turn now.</p>
<p>What archetype identifies the most influential leader in your organization? If you are a leader, what archetype is reflective of your impact? If you’ve successfully worked inside organizations lead by a Bubble King (/Queen), Attacker, Rationalizer… What worked, what did not work? Have your seen a leader transform into a different archetype – do to an HR-induced or personal induced change? What worked, what did not work? Is there an archetype you would have created, if we are looking through the lens of negative data?</p>
<p>Please share your reflections, critique, culture-shifting strategies, and tips for individuals or leaders via comments.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some moments in time are perfect to reflect on where you are, what your priorities are, and then consider what you should start-stop-continue. In those moments, you are not thinking of delivering incremental change… You are driven by a desire to deliver a <em><strong>step change</strong></em> (a large or sudden discontinuous change, especially one that makes things better – I’m borrowing the concept from mathematics and technology, from “step function”).</p>
<p>In those moments – common around new years or new annual planning cycles – the difference between delivering an <em>incremental change</em> vs. a <em>step change</em> is the quality of ideas you are considering. In this post, my hope is to both enrich your consideration set and encourage the breadth of your goals.</p>
<p>My professional areas of interest cover Customer Service, User Experience and Finance, though here on Occam’s Razor my focus is on influencing incredible Marketing through the use of innovative Analytics. To help kick-start your 2019 <em>step change</em>, I’ve written two “Top 10” lists, one for Marketing and one for Analytics – consisting of things I recommend you obsess about.</p>
<p>Each chosen obsession is very much in the spirit of my beloved principle of the <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/aggregation-marginal-gains-recession-busting-analytics/">aggregation of marginal gains</a>. My recommendation is that you deeply reflect on the impact of the 10 x 2 obsessions in your unique circumstance, and then distill the ten you’ll focus on in the next twelve months. Regardless of the then you choose, I’m confident you’ll end up working on challenging things that will push your professional growth forward and bring new joy from the work you do for your employer.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>First… The Analytics top ten things to focus on to elevate your game this year…</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">The Step Change Analytics Obsessions List.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A1.</strong> Improve the Bounce Rate of your top 10 landing pages by 50%. </font></p>
<p>(Improving Bounce Rate results in reducing it. :))</p>
<p>You&#039;ll be surprised by the steep drop in Cost per Acquisition.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/" target="_blank">Google Optimize</a> will be one of your BFFs in this quest. You’ll know you’ve moved beyond basic improvements when you start <a href="https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/7018998?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6197696#custom-objectives" target="_blank">setting Custom Objectives</a> – they require deeper thinking, which is a good sign.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>2.</strong> Eliminate 40% of the numbers from your dashboard. </font></p>
<p>Take the newly-created white space to explain <em>what to do</em> based on performance of 60% of the numbers that remain.</p>
<p>What your boss wants most this year, more than love, is to be told what the data wants her to do. Don&#039;t leave her guessing.</p>
<p>(Bonus, with actionable ideas: <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/smart-analytics-dashboard-modules-insightful-dimensions-best-metrics/">Smart Dashboard Modules.</a>)</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#3e802b"><strong>3.</strong> Take your first steps towards unlocking smart algorithms.</font></p>
<p>Learn what <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7303153?hl=en">Session Quality</a> is in Google Analytics, then learn how to use it in your campaigns to improve conversions. In the Audiences section, go to the Behavior folder.</p>
<p>Learn what <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882?hl=en" target="_blank">Smart Bidding</a> is in Google Ads, then learn how to use it in your campaigns to improve outcomes. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-implications-marketing-analytics/#mlmarketing" target="_blank">Machine Learning algorithms</a> will make our data smarter in unparalleled ways; Session Quality and Smart Bidding offer early clues about the scale and type of intellect. In both instances, it is immensely valuable to really understand how a smart algorithm uses billions of data signals to calculate likelihood of a conversion.</p>
<p>Across all your analytics data, algorithms will take you places humans simply can&#039;t. This should be the year you invest in an expansion in skills and practice to take advantage of these possibilities.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>4.</strong> Take a class in data visualization. It will save your life.</font></p>
<p>Anyone can make a complicated visual, it takes someone very special (you!) to draw out the essence of the story data is trying to tell.</p>
<p>My recommendations: </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em"><strong>Free Courses:</strong> <a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507">Data Visualization and D3.js</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-and-visualization--ud404">Data Analysis and Visualization</a> at Udacity.     <br /><strong>Affordable:</strong> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pwc-analytics">Data Analysis and Presentation Skills</a> at Coursera.     <br /><strong>Occam’s Razor</strong>: Start with this one: <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/data-last-mile-gap-visualizing-for-impact/" target="_blank">Closing Data&#039;s Last-Mile Gap: Visualizing For Impact</a>. And, there are five more <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/data-last-mile-gap-visualizing-for-impact/#comment-1211815" target="_blank">linked to here</a>. </div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">&#160;</div>
<p>Through all these courses remember the most important thing about data visualization: <em>It’s not the ink, it’s the think</em>. Obsess about improving the <em>think,</em> just as much as I’m encouraging you to improve the <em>ink</em>. </p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>5.</strong> Obsess about what happens after campaigns end.</font></p>
<p>In our analytics practice we tend to celebrate victory too early (at the end of the campaign) or with insufficient breadth (the full scope of impact).</p>
<p>Did you get customers with high lifetime value? How long did the brand lift &#8211; say Awareness &#8211; last? What was the average order value of the second purchase by people you acquire via Search, compared to those via Retail? </p>
<p>Is there a difference in behavior between people who signed up for email over the last year vs those who did not? What the cost of getting a retail customer to make subsequent purchases over mobile apps lower?</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>6.</strong> Understand your personal impact, obsess about improving it. </font></p>
<p>Grab the revenue number for the company. Now work out how much of it is influenced by you directly. Make a note of what it is (likely to be a couple percentage max).</p>
<p>Double that number this year.</p>
<p>What are the first five things on your list? </p>
<p>None of them will be easy, but converting insights into action via influence rarely is. But, you don&#039;t have to stretch too far to see how amazing it would be for you (and data too!) if you double your impact.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>7.</strong> Run one super-large controlled experiment.</font></p>
<p>To prove what your Executives believe purely from their gut. Or, to disprove it.</p>
<p>Does Facebook advertising really work better than TV? Can you create premiumness for your brand using digital? Is a 15% coupon now better than 20% off the next purchase? Does swapping out male model posters for cute animals triple sales? </p>
<p>Does sponsoring a fashion show lead to an increase in brand equity? Does free pickup in store result in higher attach rates?</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>8.</strong> Identify four relevant micro-outcomes to focus on in 2019 </font></p>
<p>(In addition to the macro-outcome of revenue).</p>
<p>Businesses win when you optimize for a portfolio, because at any given time only a tiny fraction of people want to buy. Solving for <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/google-analytics-setting-goals-and-goal-values/" target="_blank">micro and macro-outcomes</a> is directly connected to the holy grail of solving for short-term AND long-term success.</p>
<p>Employees also become smarter when they have to optimize for more than one thing. :)</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>9.</strong> Throw away your custom attribution model. Embrace <em>data-driven attribution</em>.</font></p>
<p>For some things, humans are already less smart than machines. Trying to guess what might be happening across millions of touchpoints on and off site, on and offline, is one of those things.</p>
<p>Skip the first five steps of <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-attribution-ladder-of-awesomeness/" target="_blank">attribution’s ladder of awesomeness</a>, jump to DDA. From the tens of hours saved per week, figure out how to feed offline data into your <em>data driven attribution</em> model.</p>
<p>With an obsession with data-driven attribution, you are also solving for a portfolio rather than a silo. Super cool, super profitable.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>10.</strong> Hire an experienced statistician to be a part of your analytics team.</font></p>
<p>There is too much goodness in modeling that you are not taking advantage of. From segmentation models to identifying incrementality to predictive modeling to survival analysis to clustering to time series to… I could keep going on and on.</p>
<p>2019&#039;s the year you get serious about serious analytics.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>A</strong></font><font color="#008000"><strong>11.</strong> Bonus: Reporting kills, analysis thrills.</font></p>
<p>If that is true, and it is, :), then what % of time are you personally spending between <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/create-analysis-ninjas-data-driven-cultures/#dcdrda">Data Capture &#8211; Data Reporting &#8211; Data Analysis</a>?</p>
<p><img alt="data_capture_data_reporting_data_analysis" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Marketing-and-Analtyics_139D2/data_capture_data_reporting_data_analysis_thumb.png" /></p>
<p>Outsource or eliminate half of your data capture and data reporting responsibilities, and allocate it to data analysis and driving action. </p>
<p>You&#039;ll be surprised at the increase in your salary and bonus (oh, and the company will benefit too!).</p>
<p>In context of Analytics are you aiming for something special in 2019 that I&#039;ve not covered above? Will you please share that with me by adding a comment? Thank you.</p>
<hr color="#800080" size="5" width="75%" noshade="noshade" />  </p>
<p>Switching gears, here are ten things to obsess about to collectively deliver a step change via your Marketing game this year…</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">The Step Change Marketing Obsessions List.</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M1.</strong> Improve the Bounce Rate of your top 10 landing pages by 50%. </font></p>
<p>(Improving Bounce Rate results in reducing it. :))</p>
<p>Same as the #1 on the Analytics list. :) Far too many Marketers ignore this simple strategy to make lots more money. You work so very hard to earn attention, why then let your ads write checks your website can’t cash?</p>
<p>An additional delightful benefit: I find that getting Marketers to obsess about landing pages forces them to audit the user experience, something worth its weight in gold.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M2.</strong> Put up or shut up time for your social media strategy.</font></p>
<p>99.999% of corporate social media participation yields nothing.</p>
<p>Your CMO wants people to love your brand and <em>organically</em> amplify its goodness. It genuinely is a good thought. Except, a cursory glance at your social contributions show nothing of that sort over the last three years.</p>
<p>So, why are you spending all that money?</p>
<p>I recommend using that money to buying your team iPhones every Friday, I assure you that&#039;ll have a positive ROI.</p>
<p>Or. Focus on social media primarily as a paid media strategy. Bring the same discipline to the application of accountability to social media ads that you bring to your Display or Video ads anywhere on the web.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/stop-organic-social-media-marketing-solve-for-profit/#paidsocial">Here are five brand and five performance metrics</a> that&#039;ll be your BFFs in 2019, as you social strategy lives up to that now famous mantra: <strong>Show me the money!</strong></p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M3.</strong> Keep control of creativity, give up control of the creative.</font></p>
<p>Machines are much better at optimizing the latter for short or long term. </p>
<p>(For now) You are still better at the former &#8211; do lots of it, then hand it over to smart algorithms.</p>
<p>It is hard, especially for creative types who confuse creativity with creative. But, with every passing day you are harming your bottom-line more if you don’t follow the formula above.</p>
<p>Also consider the <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/artificial-intelligence-opportunity-camel-to-cars-moment/">Machine Learning opportunities for Marketing</a> beyond creative.</p>
<p>Aim to shift 25% of your marketing budgets in 2019 to opportunities that are powered by ML algorithms and rejoice at the boost in profits that results.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M4.</strong> TV works, solve for each factor that drives success.</font></p>
<p>Most TV campaigns are sold and bought based on reach (GRPs FTW!). </p>
<p>In my experience you should optimize for reach AND one overarching story AND creative consistency AND ensure each successfully tested creative has enough frequency to <em>wear-in</em>.</p>
<p>And, if you can&#039;t solve for three ANDs… Shift money to max out the Performance Digital opportunity, then with the left over money buy every person in your team &#8211; and at your agency &#8211; a new car. Your TV budget is big enough , and trust me when I say that giving out a new car will have very high motivational and bottom-line ROI.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M5.</strong> Seek to understand the customer journey.</font></p>
<p>What drives the first purchase? What drives the second? What drives the support calls in between? What does using the product really, really feel like? What drives advocacy?</p>
<p>All advertising that fails does so because the Marketer behind it understands only one sliver of the experience, then solves for that sliver with heart-breaking short-term focus.</p>
<p>When the Marketer understands the answers to the above questions, it influences the creative, it influences targeting, it influences retail store displays, it influences frequency, it influences product design, it influences…. it changes everything. Including profits.</p>
<p><em>Journeys are better than tinder dates</em>.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M6.</strong> Solve for intent. It is more possible and more critical with every passing day.</font></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/see-think-do-care-win-content-marketing-measurement/">See-Think-Do-Care</a> is a great intent-centric business framework, if I may say so myself, for challenging your current marketing strategy.</p>
<p>What intent is your current marketing content (tv, digital, ads, emails) targeting? What happens once your ads meet that intent? What meaningful content are you publishing, on and offline, to engage audiences before and after the BUY NOW (!) moment? Is your measurement aligned with the intent your marketing is targeting, or are you <em>judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree</em>? How do you know?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/see-think-do-care-win-content-marketing-measurement/">Shifting to See-Think-Do-Care</a> is the single biggest force multiplier when it comes to your marketing. Help shift your organizational thinking to the current century in 2019.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M7.</strong> Your marketing budget allocation can be improved anywhere from 50% to 50,000%.</font></p>
<p>Allocating budgets is the hardest decision a Senior Marketer will make. Most will use strategies like <em>Digital had 27% of budget last year, this year we should do between 28 and 30%.</em> History, gut-feel, inter-company-politics, etc. are primary reasons why this silly mindset is pervasive across companies.</p>
<p>A better way? <strong>Profitable opportunity size.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#039;t think you can argue with the first part: Invest where you make more profit. The second part takes a bit more work. It comes from plotting diminishing margin curves with confidence intervals. In English: How high can the investment goes before every $1 you invest returns less?</p>
<p>You are a Marketer, so it&#039;s unlikely that you&#039;ll plot these curves. Make it a priority for your Analytics team to do so; without them massive chunks of your budget is being flushed.</p>
<p>(Also, see obsession #10 on the Analytics list.)</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M8.</strong> A grandmother&#039;s Marketing strategy for grandmothers only.</font></p>
<p>A bit provocative, but I want to challenge how most Marketers just make little tweaks to their strategy. The bigger the company, the more that this pernicious problem exists. Don&#039;t let that be you, and allow me to share two views that&#039;ll challenge your reality.</p>
<p>Here&#039;s the average time spent per day by US adults with media devices…</p>
<p><img alt="average_time_spent_media_devices_age" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Marketing-and-Analtyics_139D2/average_time_spent_media_devices_age_thumb.png" /></p>
<p>My humble description of a &quot;grandmother&#039;s marketing strategy&quot; is the bar on the right (65+).</p>
<p>It is eminently sensible for our marketing for our fellow 65+ aged Earthlings to be reflective of the implications of that right-most bar. </p>
<p>The problem arises when our entire marketing strategy is an extension of that right-most bar. For our entire marketing strategy to be structured on that 6:55 you see above, when our products and services are not 65+ centric is… A bit silly. Perhaps even reflective of failing our fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>Note the difference in total media consumption (time, place, device, more). Note the products and services your company currently offers. Reflect on this: <strong>How misaligned is your current marketing strategy?</strong></p>
<p>I get really excited about something super-cool, but subtle, in the data above: The implication of the difference between <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/breaking-silos-passive-consumption-active-engagement-ftw/">active vs. passive consumption!</a></p>
<p>The difference between leaning-back and letting <em>content</em> wash over us <strong>vs.</strong> leaning-in and pulling content you desire is huge. It dramatically changes what your marketing should be solving for (beyond the obvious investment alignment by platforms issue).</p>
<p>One more reality-check for your 2019 Marketing strategy: Here&#039;s a helpful deep drive into the shifts in consumption of TV across US adults &#8211; in just six years (!!)…</p>
<p><img alt="us_time_spent_watching_tv" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Marketing-and-Analtyics_139D2/us_time_spent_watching_tv_thumb.png" /></p>
<p>This possibly explains why Toyota&#039;s entire Marketing strategy seems to be TV-centric (with the incredible frequency of 48 per day per person here in the bay area!). It seems Toyota is only trying to sell cars to 65+ (whose TV watching has actually increased).</p>
<p>In 2019, resolve to align your marketing strategy with your <strong>1.</strong> products <strong>2.</strong> goals <strong>3.</strong> audience, and <strong>4.</strong> amount of expressed intent on the platform.</p>
<p>Credits: Originally created by Sara Fischer of Axios, the first graph is via my buddy Thomas Baekdal&#039;s newsletter. 100% of you need to <a href="https://baekdal.com/newsletter/">sign up for it</a>. The second chart is from the lovely team at <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/02/09/traditional-tvs-surprising-staying-power">The Economist</a>.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M9.</strong> Suck less more.</font></p>
<p>Every campaign you are currently executing can be made to suck less &#8211; especially if you think end-to-end experience.</p>
<p>Ex: <strong>Expedia&#039;s</strong> emails are so long they always trigger &quot;[Message clipped] View entire message.&quot; Suck less and maybe use my past behavior to send shorter emails so I know you care about me?</p>
<p>Ex: <strong>Nordstrom</strong> sends me one email a day with <em>exclusive deals</em> &#8211; how many clothes do they think I need? Suck less and maybe send me one a month? Or, base it on shopping patterns in store to deliver delight and not just a deal?</p>
<p>Ex: <strong>Macy&#039;s</strong> email I just received (titled &quot;Resolution #1: get an extra 20% off before it ends&quot;) has promotions for Women, Men, Shoes, Bed &amp; Bath, Kids, Juniors, Jewelry, Plus Sizes, Handbags, Home, Kitchen, Beauty. All above the fold. Below the fold: Large pictures with promotions for White Bedding, Biggest Underwear, Biggest Mattress (yes again), Best Face Forward, 25% off Adidas, Macy&#039;s presents the Edit, Fresh Pastels (the image does not make clear what this is), Free, Fast Pickup. PHEW! This can be unsucked at so many levels, with just a little bit of love and focus.</p>
<p>Ex: Even really good programs can use sucking less. Companies like <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> have so many divisions. Each team/department optimizes for itself, emails are pretty good, hence each thinks they are doing really well. But, if you flip the lens to me &#8211; the recipient &#8211; I get a lot of email from each company. I wish someone at G/M would track <em>Emails Sent/Humans Sent To</em>, and reflect on the sad reality. It would create a culture of Marketing with me at the center instead of a company department – you can imagine the benefits.</p>
<p>I&#039;m using email marketing as an example of activating the power of <i>suck less</i> because <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/email-marketing-campaign-analysis-metrics-practices/">I love email marketing</a>. It is an effective and profitable strategy. It has loads of behavioral data available. It needs a comparatively small team to execute well. Yet see how much opportunity there is to suck less at even the largest companies.</p>
<p>Substantially bigger opportunities to suck less exist in all other Marketing you are doing. TV. Print. Radio. Display (omg, sooooo much opportunity!). Video. Website. Mobile app. Everything else.</p>
<p>All you need to do is take a quick peek under the covers.</p>
<p>Your 10x goal for 2019: For every $1 invested in chasing a shiny object (VR ads! Influencer marketing!!!), invest $10 in sucking less in existing large clusters of your Marketing.</p>
<p>Profits that follow will also be that lopsided.</p>
<p>One last bit, <em>culture eats strategy for breakfast.</em> Create a quarterly Most Unsucked Team award, and celebrate this dimension of success. Incentives matter.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>M10.</strong> Bring your great taste and expectations to work.</font></p>
<p>You can easily recognize when something is mediocre &#8211; even when others put lipstick on the pig and run it around the organization as the greatest success of the month.</p>
<p>You know what exceptional looks and feels like &#8211; you are not just a Marketer, you are an intelligent customer.</p>
<p>Yet, my experience is that most Marketers <em>stay in their lane.</em> Often, company cultures encourage that non-beneficial behavior.</p>
<p>In 2019, speak up.</p>
<p>You have great taste. Don&#039;t leave it at home when you leave for work.</p>
<p>Speak up.</p>
<p>When you see low quality work being pushed out by your Marketing organization… Create alternative mocks. Push for your version of the brand&#039;s tag line (not the generic MBA buzzword puke-fest). Ask for a better balance between Earned-Owned-Paid marketing. Politely challenge your Leader&#039;s assertion that creative x is better because he feels like it will be. Recommend experimenting with reckless ideas, instead of directly putting 30% of the budget on them. If you see lipsticked pigs being paraded around as exceptional examples, humbly, privately, flag the corrosive implication on culture to the most senior leader who&#039;ll listen to you.</p>
<p>Speak up. </p>
<p>You deserve to be heard.</p>
<p>When you speak, it&#039;ll give others around you the courage to speak up as well. Smart people tend to run in packs.</p>
<p>That’s it. :)</p>
<p>A slight repetition: Reflect deeply on the impact of the 10 x 2 obsessions in your unique business environment. Then, distill down to a total of ten you’ll focus on in the next twelve months. Finally, put a start and expected end date for each item. If you get through the list, you would have contributed a step change to your company’s bottom-line, and discovered unexpected personal joy.</p>
<p>As always, it is your turn now.</p>
<p>If you had already identified obsessions for Analytics and/or Marketing for the next twelve months for yourself, what obsessions did you choose? I’m super curious. Are there a couple in my lists above that would be particularly impactful in your company? Some of my recommendations are quite straight-forward, what do you think get’s in the way of focusing on them? </p>
<p>Please share your obsessions, tips, culture-shifting strategies, and critique via comments below.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The universe of digital analytics is massive and can seem as complex as the cosmic universe.</p>
<p>With such big, complicated subjects, we can get lost in the vast wilderness or become trapped in a silo. We can wander aimlessly, or feel a false sense of either accomplishment or frustration. Consequently, we lose sight of where we are, how we are doing and which direction is true north. </p>
<p>I have experienced these challenges on numerous occasions myself. Even simple questions like “<em>How effective is our analytics strategy?</em>” elicit a complicated set of answers, instead of a simple picture the CxO can internalize. That’s because we have to talk about tools (so many!), work (collection, processing, reporting, analysis), processes, org structure, governance models, <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/data-last-mile-gap-visualizing-for-impact/" target="_blank">last-mile gaps</a>, <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-analytics-ladder-step-by-step-success/" target="_blank">metrics ladders of awesomeness</a>, and… so… much… more. </p>
<p>Soon, your digital analytics strategic framework that you hoped would provide a true north to the <em>analytics strategy</em> question <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+analytics+framework&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjR2Zny-7vcAhXphVQKHa2bAAcQ_AUICigB&#038;biw=1051&#038;bih=926" target="_blank">looks like this</a>…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/digital_analytics_frameworks.png"><img title="digital_analytics_frameworks" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="digital_analytics_frameworks" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/digital_analytics_frameworks_thumb.png" width="625" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The frameworks above cover just one dimension of the assessment (!). There is another critical framework to figure out how you can take your analytics sophistication from wherever it is at the moment to <em>nirvanaland</em>. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+analytics+maturity+model&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjYkfCE_LvcAhXizFQKHbqxCvIQ_AUICigB&#038;biw=1051&#038;bih=926" target="_blank">quick search query</a> will illustrate that that looks something like this…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/digital_analytics_maturity_models.png"><img title="digital_analytics_maturity_models" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="digital_analytics_maturity_models" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/digital_analytics_maturity_models_thumb.png" width="625" height="431" /></a> </p>
<p>It is important to stress that none of these frameworks/answers exist in a vacuum. </p>
<p>Both pictures above are frighteningly complex because the analytics world we occupy is complex. Remember, tools, work, processes, org structure, governance models, last-mile gaps, metrics ladders of awesomeness, and… so… much… more. </p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">The Implications of Complexity.</font></strong></p>
<p>There are two deeply painful outcomes of the approaches you see in the pictures above (in which you’ll also see my work represented as well). </p>
<p><strong>1. Obvious:</strong> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
No CxO understands the story we are trying to tell – or, even the fundamentals of what we do in the world of analytics. Therefore, they are inclined to remain committed to faith-based decision-making and continue to starve analytics of the attention and investment it deserves.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>2. Non-obvious:</strong> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Leaders of analytics organizations do not truly appreciate the wonderful effectiveness, or gross ineffectiveness, of their analytics practice (people, process, tools). You see… None of the currently recommended frameworks and maturity models aids analytics leaders in truly understanding the <strong>bottom line impact</strong> of their work. The result is analytical strategies that are uninformed by reality, and driven new tool features, random expert recommendations and shiny objects (<em>OMG we have to get offline attribution!</em>).</p>
</div>
<p>When one grasps these two outcomes – <em>blind </em>business leaders, <em>blind</em> analytics leaders – it is simply heartbreaking. </p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">Simplifying Complexity.</font></strong></p>
<p>The dilemma of how to simplify this complexity, to create <em>sighted </em>business and analytics leaders, has lingered with me for quite some time. I’ve intended to create a simple visual that absorbs the scale, complexity and many moving parts. </p>
<p>On this blog, you’ve seen numerous attempts by me to remedy the dilemma. To name a few: <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-marketing-and-measurement-model/" target="_blank">Digital Marketing &amp; Measurement Model </a>| <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/complete-digital-analytics-ecosystem-how-to-win-big/" target="_blank">Analytics Ecosystem</a> | <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/best-web-analytics-tools-quantitative-qualitative/" target="_blank">Web Analytics 2.0</a>.&#160; Each aimed to solve a particular dimension, yet none solved the heartache completely. Especially for the non-obvious problem #2 above. </p>
<p>The hunger remained. </p>
<p>I wanted to create a visual that would function as a diagnostic tool to determine if you are lost, trapped in a silo or wandering aimlessly. It would help you realize the extent to which analytics impacted the business bottom line today, and what your future analytics plans should accomplish.</p>
<p>Then one day, a magic moment.</p>
<p>During a discussion around planning for measurement, a peer was struggling with a unique collection of challenges. He asked me a couple of questions, and that sparked an idea.</p>
<p>I walked up to the whiteboard, and excitedly sketched something simple that abstracted away the complexity – and yet preserved the power of smarter thinking at the same time.</p>
<p>Here’s the sketch I drew in response:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact_time_metrics_matrix_sketch.jpg"><img title="impact_time_metrics_matrix_sketch" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="impact_time_metrics_matrix_sketch" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact_time_metrics_matrix_sketch_thumb.jpg" width="625" height="831" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, it was an ugly birth. But, to me, the proud parent, it was beautiful. </p>
<p>It took a sixteen hour direct flight to Singapore for the squiggly sketch to come to life – where else, in PowerPoint!</p>
<p>The end result was just five slides. As the saying goes: <em>It&#039;s not the ink, it&#039;s the think.</em> </p>
<p>I want to share the fully fleshed out, put into practice and refined, version of those four slides with you today. Together, they’ll help you fundamentally rethink your analytics practice by, 1. understanding data’s actual impact on your company today and, 2. picking very precise and specific things that should be in your near and long-term analytics plans.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">The Impact Matrix.</font></strong></p>
<p>To paint a simple picture of the big, complicated world of analytics, the whiteboard above shows a 2&#215;2 matrix.</p>
<p>Each cell contains a metric (online, offline, <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/multichannel-analytics-tracking-online-impact-offline-campaigns/" target="_blank">nonline</a>).</p>
<p>The business impact is on the y-axis, illustrated from Super Tactical to Super Strategic. </p>
<p>The <em>time-to-useful</em> is on the x-axis, illustrated from Real-Time to 6-Monthly.</p>
<p>Before we go on… Yes, breaking the x-axis into multiple time segments creates a 2&#215;5 matrix, and not a 2&#215;2. Consider that to be the price I’ve paid in order to make this more actionable for you. :)</p>
<p>Diving a bit deeper into the y-axis… Super Tactical is the smallest possible impact on the business (fractions of pennies). Super Strategic represents the largest possible impact on the business (tens of millions of dollars). </p>
<p>The scale on the y-axis is <em>exponential</em>. You’ll notice the numbers in light font between Super Tactical and Super Strategic go from 4 to 10 to 24 to 68 and onward. This demonstrates that impact is not a step-change &#8211; every step up delivers a massively higher impact. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-shell-sm.png"><img title="impact-time-metrics-matrix-shell-sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="impact-time-metrics-matrix-shell-sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-shell-sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="406" /></a></p>
<p>Diving a bit deeper into the x-axis… While most data can be collected in real-time now, not all metrics are useful in real-time. </p>
<p>As an example, Impressions can be collected in real-time and they can also become useful in real-time (if actioned, they can have a super tactical impact – fractions of pennies). Customer Lifetime Value on the other hand takes a long time to become useful, over months and months (if actioned, it can have a super strategic impact on the business – tens of millions of dollars). </p>
<p>Here is a representation of these ideas on the <strong>Impact Matrix</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-framing_sm.png"><img title="impact-time-metrics-matrix-framing_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="impact-time-metrics-matrix-framing_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-framing_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="405" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1"><strong>[You can download an Excel version of the Impact Matrix at the end of this post.]</strong></font></p>
<p>Impressions can be used in real-time for decision-making by your display, video and search platforms (e.g., via automation). You can report Gross Profit in real-time, of course, but doing so is almost entirely useless. It should be deeply analyzed monthly to yield valuable, higher impact actionable insights. Finally, Lifetime Value will require perhaps the toughest strategic analysis, from data accumulated over months, and the action takes time to yield results – but they are magnificent. </p>
<p>Pause. Reflect on the above picture. </p>
<p>If you understand why each metric is where it is, the rest of this post will fill you with euphoric joy rarely experienced without physical contact. </p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">The Impact Matrix: A Joyous Deep Dive.</font></strong></p>
<p>In all, the Impact Matrix contains 46 of the most commonly used business metrics – with an emphasis on sales and marketing. The metrics span digital, television, retail stores, billboards, and any other presence of a brand you can think of. You see more digital metrics because digital is more measurable. </p>
<p>Some metrics apply across all channels, like Awareness, Consideration and Purchase Intent. You’ll note the most critical bottom line metrics, which might come from your ERP and CRM systems, are also included. </p>
<p>Every metric occupies a place based on business impact and time of course, but also in context of other metrics around it. </p>
<p>Here’s a magnified view that includes the bottom left portion of the matrix:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-close-up_sm.png"><img title="impact-time-metrics-matrix-close-up_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="impact-time-metrics-matrix-close-up_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-close-up_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s continue to internalize <em>impact</em> and<em> time-to-useful</em> by looking at a specific example: Bounce Rate. It’s in the row indicating an <em>impact </em>of four and in the <em>time-to-useful </em>column weekly. While Bounce Rate is available in real-time, it is only useful after you’ve collected a critical amount of data (say, over a week).</p>
<p>On the surface, it might seem odd that a simple metric like Bounce Rate has an <em>impact </em>of four and TV GRPs and % New Visits are lower. My reason for that is the broader influence of Bounce Rates. </p>
<p>Effectively analyzing and acting on Bounce Rates requires the following:</p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 2em">
* A deep understanding of owned, earned and paid media strategies.</p>
<p>* The ability to identify any empty promises made to the users who are bouncing.</p>
<p>* Knowing the content, including its emotional and functional value.</p>
<p>* The ability to optimize landing pages.</p>
</div>
<p>Imagine the impact of those insights; it is well beyond Bounce Rates. That is why Bounce Rate garners more weight than Impressions, Awareness and other common metrics.</p>
<p>When designating a metric as a KPI, this is your foremost consideration: <strong>depth of influence</strong>.</p>
<p>With a better understanding of the Impact Matrix, here’s the full version:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-complete-sm.png"><img title="impact-time-metrics-matrix-complete-sm" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="impact-time-metrics-matrix-complete-sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-complete-sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="400" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1"><strong>[You can download an Excel version of the Impact Matrix at the end of this post.]</strong></font></p>
<p>As you reflect on the filled out matrix, you’ll note that I’ve layered in subtle incentives.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to compute anything Per Human, you would need to completely revamp your identity platforms (a strategy I’ve always favored: <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/cookies-to-humans-implications-identity-systems-incentives/" target="_blank">Implications Of Identity Systems On Incentives</a>). Why should you make this extra effort? Notice how high those metrics sits on the business impact scale! </p>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">Other hidden features.</font></strong></p>
<p>The value of voice of customer metrics is evident by their high placement in context of the y-axis. Take a look at where Task Completion Rate by Primary Purpose and Likelihood to Recommend are, as an example. They are high in the hierarchy due to their positive impact on both the business and the company culture – thus delivering a soft and hard advantage.</p>
<p>You’ll also note that most pure digital metrics – Adobe, Google Analytics – sit in the tactical bottom line impact. If all you do day and night is just those metrics, this is a wake-up call to you in context of your actual impact on the company and the impact of that on your career.</p>
<p>At the top-right, you’ll discover my obsession with Profit and Incrementality, which form the basis of competitive advantage in 2018 (and beyond). Analyzing these metrics not only fundamentally changes marketing strategy (think tens of millions of dollars for large companies); their insights can change your company’s product portfolio, your customer engagement strategies and much more.</p>
<p>The matrix also includes what is likely the world’s first widely available machine learning-powered metric: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7303153?hl=en" target="_blank">Session Quality</a>, which you’ll&#160; find roughly in the middle. For every session on your desktop or mobile site, Session Quality provides a score between 1 and 100 as an indication of how close the visitor is to converting. The number is computed based on a ML algorithm that has learned from deep analysis of your user behavior and conversion data.</p>
<p>Pause. Download the full resolution version of the picture. Reflect.</p>
<p>It is my hope that the placement of each of the 46 metrics will help you add metrics that might be unique to your work. (Share them in comments below, add to our collective knowledge.)</p>
<p>With a better understanding of the matrix, you are ready to overcome the two problems that broke our hearts at the start of the post – and do something super-cool that you did not think we might. </p>
<p><font color="#0000ff"><strong>Action #1: Analytics Program Maturity Diagnostic.</strong></font></p>
<p>Enough theory, time to some real, sexy, work.</p>
<p>The core driver behind creation of the Impact Matrix was the non-obvious problem #2: <em>How much does your analytics practice matter from a bottom line perspective?</em></p>
<p>YOU matter if you have a business impact. You’ll have a business impact if your analytics practice is sophisticated enough to produce metrics that matter. See the nice circular reference? </p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>In our case we measure maturity not by evaluating people, process, and layers upon layers of tools, rather we measure maturity by evaluating the output of that entire song and dance.</p>
<p>Answer this simple question: <em>What metrics are most commonly used to make decisions that drive actual actions every week/month/more?</em></p>
<p>Ignore the metrics produced as an experimental exercise nine months ago. Ignore the metrics whose only purpose is to float along the river of data pukes. Ignore the metrics you wish you were analyzing, but don’t currently.</p>
<p>Reality. Assess, reality. No point in fooling yourself. </p>
<p>Take the subset of metrics that actively drive action, and change the font color for them to <font color="#008000"><strong>green</strong></font> in the Impact Matrix. </p>
<p>For a large European client with a multi-channel existence, here’s what the Impact Matrix looked like after this honest self-reflection:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytics-program-savvy-sm.png"><img title="impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytics-program-savvy-sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytics-program-savvy-sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytics-program-savvy-sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="408" /></a></p>
<p>More of the digital metrics are green, because there are more digital metrics period. You can see the company’s marketing strategy spans television and other offline advertising, including retail. </p>
<p>You’ll likely recognize many of these metrics as the one that your analytics practice outputs every day. They represent the result of a lot of hard work by the company employees, and external analytics partners.</p>
<p>We are trying to answer the <em>how much does the analytics practice matter</em> question. You can see that more sharply now.</p>
<p>For this company most green metrics cluster in the bottom-left quadrant, with most having an impact of ten or under (on a y-axis scale of 1 to a ). There is one clear outlier (Nonline Direct Revenue – a very difficult metric to compute, so hurray!)</p>
<p>As every good consultant know, if you have a 2&#215;2 you can create four thematic quadrants. In our case the four quadrants are called Solid Foundation, Intermediate, and Advanced:</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytics-program-maturity_sm.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>For our company, the maturity of the analytics practice fit mostly in the Solid Foundation quadrant. </p>
<p>Is this a good thing? </p>
<p>It depends on how long the analytics practice has been around, how many Analysts the company has, how much money it has invested in analytics tools, the size of their agency analytics team, so on and so forth. </p>
<p>If they have a team of 50 people spending $18 mil on analytics investment each year, over the last decade, with 12 tools and 25 research studies each year… You can now infer that this is not a good thing. </p>
<p>Regardless, the Impact Matrix now illuminates clearly that highly influential metrics are underutilized. These are the metrics&#160; that facilitate deeper thought, patience and analysis to deliver big bottom line impact. </p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>Recommendation Uno</strong>:</font> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Conduct this exercise for your own company. Identify the metrics actively being used for decision-making. Which quadrant reflects the maturity of your analytics program? With the investment in people, process, tools, and consultants, are you in a quadrant where your bottom line impact is super strategic?</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>Recommendation Dos</strong>:</font> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Identify your target quadrant. In this instance the company could move bottom-right and then up. They could also move top-left and then top-right. The choice depends on business strategy and current people, process, tools reality. This should be obvious; you always want the Advanced quadrant lit up. But, you can’t go from Beginner to Advanced directly – evolution works smarter than revolution. (If your Solid Foundation quadrant is not lit up, do that first.)</p>
</div>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>Recommendation Très</strong>:</font> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Create a specific plan for the initiatives you need to undertake to get to your next desired quadrant. You’ll certainly need new talent, you’ll need a stronger strategic leader (less <em>ink,</em> more <em>think</em>), you’ll need to identify specific analytics projects to deliver those metrics, and you’ll most definitely need funding. Divide the plan into six-month segments with milestones for accountability.</p>
</div>
<p>The good news is that it is now, finally, clear where you are going AND why you are going there. Congratulations!</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>Recommendation Cuatro</strong>:</font> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Start a cultural shift. Share the results of your assessment, the green and black reflection of the current reality, with the entire company. Inspire each Marketer, Finance Analyst, Logistics Support Staff, Call Center Manager, and every VP to move one step up or one step to the right. If they currently measure AVOC, challenge them to move to Unique Page Views or Click-thru Rate. It will be a small challenge, but it will improve sophistication and, as you can see in the matrix, the impact on the bottom line.</p>
</div>
<p>Most companies wait for some Jesus-Krishna hybrid to descend from heaven and deliver a glorious massive revolution project (overnight!). These never happen. Sorry, Jesus-Krishna. Instead, what it takes is each employee moving a little bit up and a little bit to the right while the Analytics team facilitates those shifts. Small changes accumulate big bottom line impact over time. </p>
<p>So. What’s your quadrant? And, what’s your next right or next up move?</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">Action #2: Aligning Metrics &amp; Leadership Altitude.</font></strong></p>
<p>When offered data, everyone wants everything. </p>
<p>People commonly believe that more data means better results. Or, that if an Agency is providing a 40 tab, font size 8, spreadsheet full of numbers that they must have done a lot of work – hence better value for money. Or, a VP wants two more histograms that represent seven dimensions squeezed into her one page dashboard. </p>
<p>If more data equaled smarter decisions, they would be peace on earth.</p>
<p>A core part of our job, as owners of the analytics practice, is to ensure that the right data (metric) reaches the right person at the right time.</p>
<p>To do so, we must consider <em>altitude </em>(aka the y-axis). </p>
<p>Altitude dictates the scope and significance of decisions.&#160; It also dictates the frequency at which data is received, along with the depth of insights that need to accompany the data (<a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/digital-dashboards-strategic-tactical-best-practices-tips-examples/" target="_blank">IABI FTW!</a>). Finally, altitude determines the amount of time allotted to discuss findings.</p>
<p>Managers have a lower altitude, they are required to make tactical decisions – impacting say tens of thousands of dollars. VPs have a higher altitude, they are paid a ton more in salary, bonus and stock, because they carry the responsibility for making super strategic decisions – impacting tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>This problem has a beautifully elegant solution if you use the Impact Matrix.</p>
<p>Slice the matrix horizontally to ensure that the metrics delivered to each leader are aligned with their altitude. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-leadership-levels_sm.png"><img title="impact-time-metrics-matrix-leadership-levels_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="impact-time-metrics-matrix-leadership-levels_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-leadership-levels_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="366" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1"><strong>[You can download an Excel version of the Impact Matrix at the end of this post.]</strong></font></p>
<p>VPs sit at decision making that is squarely in the Super Strategic realm – on our scale ~40 and higher. This collection of metrics power heavy decisions requiring abundant business context, deep thinking and will influence broad change. Analysts will need that time to conduct proper analysis and obtain the IABI.</p>
<p>You can also see that nearly all metrics delivered to the VPs arrive monthly or even less frequently. Another reflection of the fact that their altitude requires solving problems that will connect across orgs, across incentives, across user touch points, etc.</p>
<p>So. Are the metrics on your VP Dashboards/Slides the ones in Super Strategic cluster?</p>
<p>Or. Is your analytics practice such that your VPs spend their time making tactical decisions?</p>
<p>Below the VP layer, you’ll see metric clusters for slightly less strategic impact on the company bottom line for Directors. The <em>time-to-useful</em> also changes on the x-axis for them. Following them is the layer for managers, who make even more frequent, tactical&#160; decisions. </p>
<p>The last layer is my favorite way to improve decision making: Removing humans from the process. :)</p>
<p>Recent technical advancements allow us to use algorithms – machine learning – to automate decisions made by metrics that have a Super Tactical impact. For example, there is no need for any human to review <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewable_Impression" target="_blank">Viewability</a> because advanced display platforms optimize campaigns automatically against this metric. In fact an expensive human looking at reports with that metric will only slow things down – eliminating the fractions of penny impact that that metric delivers.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>Recommendation Cinco</strong>:</font> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Collect the dashboards and main reports created by your analytics practice. Cluster them by altitude (VP, Directors…). Identify if the metrics being reported to each leadership layer are the ones being recommended by the Impact Matrix. </p>
<p>For example: Does your last CMO report include Profit per Human, Incremental Profit per Non-line Channel, % Contribution of Non-line Channels to Sales? If yes, hurray! Instead, if they are reporting Awareness, Consideration, Intent, Conversions, Bounce Rate… Sad time. Why would your CMO use his or her valuable time making tactical choices? Is it a culture problem? Is it a reflection of the lack of analytical savvy? Why? </p>
</div>
<p>Put simply, the big and complicated is not so big and not so complicated. This simple analysis will help identify core issues that are stymieing the contribution data can make to smarter, faster, business success.</p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>Recommendation Seis</strong>:</font> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Kick off a specific initiative to tackle automation. If data is available in real-time and useful in real-time, there are algorithms out there that can make decisions for humans. If there is a limitation, it is all yours (people, bureaucracy, connection points, etc.). </p>
<p>For the other layers, action will depend on what the problem is. It could require new leadership in the analytics team, it could require a shift in company culture, or it could require a different engagement model across layers (managers, directors, VPs). One thing adjusting the altitude will certainly require: Change in how employees are compensated.</p>
</div>
<p>As you notice above, the strength of the matrix is in it’s ability to simplify complexity. That does not mean that you don’t have to deal with complexity – you can be more focused about it now!</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">Action #3: Strategic Alignment of Analytical Effort.</font></strong></p>
<p>One more slicing exercise for our matrix, this time for the analytics team itself.</p>
<p>Analytics teams face a daunting challenge when figuring out what type of effort to put into tackling the fantastic collection of possibilities represented in the Impact Matrix. </p>
<p>That challenge is compounded by the fact that there is always too much to do and too few people to do it with. Oh, and don’t get me started on time! Why are there only 24 hours in a day??</p>
<p>So, how do we ensure that each has an optimal analytical approach?</p>
<p>Slice the matrix vertically along the <em>time-to-useful</em> dimension…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytical-effort_sm.png"><img title="impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytical-effort_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytical-effort_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Analytics-Framework-A-Digital-Analytics-_146E9/impact-time-metrics-matrix-analytical-effort_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="423" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1"><strong>[You can download an Excel version of the Impact Matrix at the end of this post.]</strong></font></p>
<p>For any metric that is useful in real-time, we have to unpack the forces of automation. Campaigns can be optimized based on real-time impressions, clicks, visits, page views, cost per acquisition etc. We need to stop reporting these, and start feeding them into our campaign platforms like AdWords, DoubleClick etc. With simple rules – ranges mostly – automation platforms can do a better job of taking action than humans. </p>
<p>If you are investing in machine learning talent inside your team, even narrowly intelligent algorithms they build will learn faster and surpass humans quickly for these simple decisions.</p>
<p>With the day-to-day sucking of life spirit reduced, tactical impact decisions automated, the analytics practice has time to focus on metrics that have a longer <em>time-to-useful </em>and need deeper human analysis to extract the IABI.</p>
<p>For metrics available weekly or within a few weeks, reporting to various stakeholders (mostly Managers and Directors) should adequately inform decisions. Use custom alerts, trigger threshold targets and more to send this data to the right person at the right time. For weekly <em>time-to-useful </em>metrics, your stakeholders have enough tactical context that you don’t need to spend time on deep analysis since the metrics inform the tactical decisions.</p>
<p>More role clarity, a thoughtful shift of the burden to the stakeholders, and more free time to focus on what really matters.</p>
<p>For where <em>time-to-useful</em> is in the month range, you are now truly heading into strategic territory. Reflect on the metrics there – challenging, strategic, Director and VP altitude. It is no longer enough to just report <em>what happened,</em> you need to identify <em>why it happened</em> and what the causal impact is for the <em>why</em> factors. This will yield insights that will have millions of dollars of potential impact on the company. That means, you’ll need to invest in ensuring your stories have more than just insights but also include specific recommended actions and predicted business impact. Amazingly, you’ll have just as much text as data in your output (that’s how you know you are doing it right!). </p>
<p>Finally, we have the pinnacle of analytics achievement. Our last vertical slice includes metrics that measure performance across customer segments, divisions and channels, among other elements. This is where meta-analysis comes into play, requiring even more time, with even more complex analytical techniques that pull data into BigQuery or similar environments where you can do your own joins, unleash R, use statistically modeling techniques (hello random forests!) to find the most important factors affecting your company’s performance. </p>
<p>The distribution of your analytical team’s effort across these four categories is another method of assessing maturity as well as ensuring optimal impact by the precious few analytical resources. For example: If most of your time is occupied by providing data to decision-makers for metrics in the Automate and Reporting vertical slices, you are likely in the beginner stage (and not having much impact on the business bottom line). </p>
<p><font color="#008000"><strong>Recommendation Siete</strong>:</font> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
Find an empty conference room. Project all the work your team has delivered in the last 30 days on the screen. Cluster it by Automated, Reporting, Analysis and Meta-Analysis. Roughly compute what percentage of the team’s time was spent in each category. What do you see? Is the distribution optimal? And, are the metrics in each cluster the ones identified by the Impact Matrix?&#160; </p>
<p>The answers to these questions will cause a fundamental re-imagination of your analytics practices. The implications will be deep and wide (people, process, tools). That is how you get on the road to true <em>nirvanaland</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>#sisepuede</p>
<p>At the core of the Impact Matrix is the only thing that matters: the business bottom line. Using two simple dimensions, impact and <em>time-to-useful</em>, you can explain simply three unique elements of any successful analytics practice. The reflections are sometimes painful, but bringing them to light allows us to take steps toward systematic improvement of our analytical practice. </p>
<p>That’s the power of a 2&#215;2 (or a 2&#215;5)!</p>
<p>Here’s an <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/avinash_kaushik_analtyics_impact_matrix.zip" target="_blank">Excel version of the Impact Matrix</a> for your personal use.&#160; </p>
<p>As always, it is your turn now.</p>
<p>When your CMO asks, “<em>How effective is our analytics strategy?</em>”, what’s your answer? How simply can you frame it? What are the primary inputs to your near and long-term analytics evolution plans? If your VPs are getting the metrics in the Advanced quadrant, what strategies have been effective in getting you there? If you’ve successfully implemented pattern matching and advanced classification meta-analysis techniques, care to share your lessons with us? </p>
<p>Please share your feedback about the Impact Matrix, and answers to the above questions, via comments below. I look forward to the conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By every indicator available, ecommerce is continuing to grow at an insane speed. Although it may seem impossible to imagine with ecommerce already totaling up to 5% of overall commerce, there’s astronomical growth still to come. </p>
<p>Still, I’m heartbroken that some the simplest elements of ecommerce stink so much. </p>
<p>It is 2018—why are there still light gray below-the-fold add to cart buttons? </p>
<p>#youarekillingme </p>
<p>There are numerous subtle issues as well. One strategic issue is illustrated by Timbuk2.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img alt="timbuk2_closer" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/timbuk2_closer_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>Timbuk2 pays a huge margin to its resellers to sell their messenger bags. These resellers, in turn, give a bigger cut to Amazon, who then sells the Timbuk2 bag for 30% off. Yet, when I want to pay full price on <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com" target="_blank">www.timbuk2.com</a>, I have to buy a minimum of $99 to get free shipping!</p>
<p>I understand channel conflict, Timbuk2, but this is just plain not being hungry. You could win bigger by cultivating higher more profitable direct relationships, especially when the old world order of commerce is collapsing all around you. </p>
<p>And I’m ignoring the extremely light gray font reviews…on a shade grayer background!</p>
<p><center><img alt="timbuk2_reviews" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/timbuk2_reviews_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>Painful.</p>
<p>(I really want to buy the Closer Laptop bag. The small one in Jet Black looks cool. I refused to buy it because I don’t want to reward a lack of ecommerce imagination. I am one person, I know it is not going to really hurt them, but I don’t know how else to protest a brand I love.)</p>
<p>Pause. Deep breath.</p>
<p>I do get excited about this stuff. My heart bleeds digital.</p>
<p>There is an ocean of opportunities when it comes to elevating ecommerce. In this post, I want to focus my passion and zero in on something that is difficult to solve for, yet immensely profitable: <b>Inserting a sense of urgency into the shopping process.</b></p>
<p>I don’t mean: BUY IT NOW OR ELSE! </p>
<p>I mean developing and inserting a subtle collection of gentle nudges that can help increase the conversion rate by a statistically significant amount.</p>
<p><b><font color="#0000ff">Sizing the Opportunity.</font></b></p>
<p>In order to have the same passion to take advantage of this magical opportunity (nudge, nudge) you’ll first want to understand how inefficient your current shopping process is. </p>
<p>Do two things, they’ll bring you to your knees:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Go look at your ecommerce conversion rate. It shows you how often you win. :) Your overall conversion rate is likely to be around 2%. You don’t need an advanced degree in math to compute that 2% winning is 98% not winning!</p>
<p>Do something simple. Increase current conversion rate by 25%, quantify how much increased revenue there will be. Yes, that additional $6 mil is not as hard to accomplished for an imaginative focused team – in fact you can get that from implementing half of the recommendations in this blog post.</p>
<p><b><font color="#008000">Bonus:</font></b> The best computation of <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/excellent-analytics-tip5-conversion-rate-basics-best-practices/" target="_blank">conversion rate is orders divided by users</a> (the default in your analytics tool is sessions). This will bring your conversion rate up (yea!!). Still. Big opportunity. And, yes, I did say a decade ago that you should look at the <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/excellent-analytics-tip-8-measure-the-real-conversion-rate-opportunity-pie/" target="_blank">opportunity size within all your website visitors</a>. You should. Still. The conversion headroom is massive. </p>
<p><center></p>

</center></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Go to the Multi-Channel Funnels folder in Google analytics and look at two other yummy reports: Time Lag and Path Length. </p>
<p>They report two dimensions of speed: <i>How long does it take for a human to convert?</i> <i>How many visits does it take for a human to convert?</i></p>
<p>My preferred choice is Path Length; it is rich and actionable.</p>
<p>This data you’ll see, the analysis you’ll do, will scare you. It will also create a sense of urgency to do something about it!</p>
<p>These two recommendations will help you compute the opportunity size for your management team. </p>
<p>Aim for quintupling revenue, obviously, but calculating just 25% improvement will give you all the budget you need from your management to insert urgency into the shopping process. Present a yummy <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/data-visualization-inspiration-analysis-insights-action-faster/#predictivemodeling" target="_blank">spreadsheet that quantifies the cost of inaction</a>, how much money you’ll lose by not delivering a 25% improvement every week. It will be heartbreaking, and now you are ready for progress! </p>
<p><b><font color="#0000ff">Welcome to Nudging.</font></b></p>
<p>Nudging has plenty of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nudge" target="_blank">different definitions</a>. Mine is simple: </p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<i>A gentle incentive that creates a shift in behavior.</i>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><p>Another insistence of mine that you’ll note below: Nudges are based on a deep understanding of user experience. They solve for the user first, and all of the hard work is done by the company (you!).</p>
<p>In the long run that’ll also create a positive revenue outcome for you. Win-Win.</p>
<p>Below is a collection of nudges, curated from my global experiences, influenced by research and data I’ve access to. </p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<strong> 1. </strong>  <a href="#instock"> In-stock status.  </a>  <br />
<strong> 2. </strong>  <a href="#lifeofprice"> Life of current price.   </a>  <br />
<strong> 3. </strong>   <a href="#competitorcomps"> Direct competitor comparisons.  </a>   <br />
<strong> 4. </strong>   <a href="#deliverytimes"> Delivery times based on geo/IP/mobile phone location. </a>    <br />
<strong> 5. </strong>   <a href="#socialproof"> Social cues to the rescue. </a>    <br />
<strong> 6. </strong>   <a href="#yespersonalize"> Personalization. Yes, from 1995!</a>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><p>My goal with these recommendations is to have a big impact on your ecommerce existence, and to spark your creativity as you go out and change the world.</p>
<p>Let’s go have some fun nudging people. </p>
<p><b> <a name="instock"> </a><font color="#ff0080">1. In-stock status.</font></b></p>
<p>It mildly irritates me when sites don’t use this nudge. </p>
<p>How many hotel rooms, cameras, seats in a theater, are left? </p>
<p><i>Only 15 left in stock.</i> Have that right under the price. </p>
<p>How about: <i>Last run! Be one of the last 9 people to own this credenza design.</i></p>
<p>OMG! Click, click, click!</p>
<p>Or, <i>1 in-stock in the REI store next to your office.</i></p>
<p>Nudge. Nudge.</p>
<p><center><img alt="target_in_stock_status" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/target_in_stock_status_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>I’ll admit that you need to have a well-integrated logistics platform to make these ideas work. But given the decade we are in, if you have not already done that, you are facing an existential crisis. Please stop reading this post, pull in your agency and internal teams urgently to figure out how to dig your company out of this deep hole. </p>
<p>If you have a well-integrated logistics platform already, then all I’m asking for is this: lock your online and offline IT folks in a nice Four Seasons suite for 72 hours with your User Researchers, and BAM! Money will start falling from the sky. </p>
<p>Speaking of the Four Seasons, consider how sad their nudging strategy is vs. the one that booking.com has on display:</p>
<p><center><img alt="four_seasons_vs_booking_nudges" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/four_seasons_vs_booking_nudges_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>All the data you need for this nudge… You already have. That’s what makes the Four Seasons strategy, and that of most sites, so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Convert the inventory status into a conversion boosting nudge.</p>
<p><b><a name="lifeofprice"> </a><font color="#ff0080">2. Life of current price.</font></b></p>
<p>It physically pains me how rarely this nudge is used.</p>
<p>Dynamic pricing is everywhere. Why not share that information with the shopper?</p>
<p><i>This price is guaranteed for the next 18 hours.</i></p>
<p><i>This price reflects the highest discount in the past 24 weeks.</i></p>
<p><i>Limited-time offer applied to the price you see.</i></p>
<p><i>Seasonal promotion! Expires Friday.</i></p>
<p><i>Reflects special pricing for our highest-tier Frequent Flyers.</i></p>
<p><i>Price has reduced by 14% since your last visit.</i></p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll find language and phrasing that works perfectly for you (see <strong>PS</strong> at the end of this post). There is a nugget tied to a unique dimension for your dynamic pricing strategy. Please find it, please use it.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from The Golf Warehouse:</p>
<p><center><img alt="the_golf_warehouse_limited_time_pricing" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/the_golf_warehouse_limited_time_pricing_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>Here’s another one from Overstock that shows two time based nudges…</p>
<p><center><img alt="overstock_time_bound_sale_time_to_ship" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/overstock_time_bound_sale_time_to_ship_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>You can take advantage of other dimensions related to pricing that are unique to your digital strategy. </p>
<p>This one comes from YouTube TV: <i>Lock-in this monthly rate for life.</i></p>
<p>YouTube TV’s price just went up from $35 to $40 (they added more channels). Everyone who’d signed up at $35 was grandfathered at that price – until they cancel! </p>
<p>Yet, this incredible benefit was not a part of YouTube TV’s merchandizing strategy from day one. You can imagine that a whole bunch of additional people (me!) would have jumped on board. Instead not only do I not have YouTube TV, I am sad/upset. Double loss.</p>
<p>You have an entire staff of economists, financial analysts, directors and VPs spending so much time on finding the perfect price to charge an individual. Why not convert that immense hard work into a nudge that creates a sense of urgency?</p>
<p><b><a name="competitorcomps"> </a><font color="#ff0080">3. Direct competitor comparisons.</font></b></p>
<p><i>38% cheaper than Nordstrom.</i></p>
<p>Sometimes, by using one of the multitude of price aggregators, you can have an understanding of where your pricing is at an item level. Where the match is in your favor, why not use that as a nudge? </p>
<p>You can have the comparison for as long as it is valid. You don’t even need to specify a time—people are familiar with FOMO. </p>
<p><i>Only at B&amp;H, this item comes with a free LG Watch!</i></p>
<p>First, who does not like free stuff?</p>
<p>Second, who does not like believing they are getting a special deal?</p>
<p>Three, who does not freak out that if they don’t buy it right away, this “insane deal” will disappear?</p>
<p>Me. I did that. At B&amp;H. :)</p>
<p>Again, your merchandizing team is working hard to procure these amazing bundles for your customers, so why are they not a core part of your nudge strategy?</p>
<p><i>Costco Special: Get an extra year of warranty!</i></p>
<p><i>Our average delivery times to California are 50% faster than Amazon.</i></p>
<p><i>Save $150 on installation compared to Best Buy!</i></p>
<p><i>Our return rates are 40% lower than Wayfair.</i></p>
<p>You catch my drift. </p>
<p>Here’s just one example from SugarCRM:</p>
<p><center><img alt="sugar_crm_comparison" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/sugar_crm_comparison_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>Here’s a comparison on Honda’s site… </p>
<p><center><img alt="toyota_honda" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/toyota_honda_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>No, actually it is from Toyota’s site.</p>
<p>They know that if their car is more expensive, with worse mileage etc., better to be upfront as the customers are looking for that information…</p>
<p>You can also go deeper when it comes to implementing the spirit of this nudge. Kendrick Astro Instruments has the <a href="http://www.kendrickastro.com/comparison.html" target="_blank">normal table based competitor comparison</a>, additionally they also have a detailed comparison with images to give you more detail…</p>
<p><center><img alt="kendrick_astro" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/kendrick_astro_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>This shows hunger and desire to win… Their text:</p>
<p><div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<em>This image displays the quality of Kendrick&#039;s cabling that we use on all Premier and FireFly heaters. Our cabling remains flexible in cold weather (down to -40° C), are all labeled for easy identification and all have metal RCA connectors..</em></div>
</p>
<p>This is the text next to their competitor&#039;s image (which you can view in higher resolution):</p>
<p><div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<em>This image displays a competitor&#039;s cabling. It is a PVC coated RCA patch cord. PVC gets very stiff in the cold and as a result, makes it an awkward component to use at the telescope. As well, due to the lack of flexibility and give in the cold, it can defocus camera lenses.</em></div>
</p>
<p>Not all that hard to see how this nudge drives higher conversion rates. </p>
<p>Your employees stand up at 11:00 AM each day and sing the company song. There is a line in there about your company’s unique value proposition. Something so special, it stands out against everyone you compete with.</p>
<p>Why let that be your little secret? Why don’t you convert that into a nudge? </p>
<p>Consider how much louder your 11:00 AM company sing-a-long will be when your employees see you laying it out there and going head to head with your competitors.</p>
<p><b><a name="deliverytimes"> </a><font color="#ff0080">4. Delivery times based on geo/IP/mobile phone location.</font></b></p>
<p>Amazon does this really well. </p>
<p>Each item’s estimated delivery time to you depends on the closest warehouse to your home address. So that Timbuk2 bag might be delivered to me the next day, but it would take two days to get to<a> </a>Carissa in Alabama.</p>
<p>Amazon shows this <i>best delivery time for me</i> right next to the price. </p>
<p>More often than not, I see that <strong>Prime One-Day</strong> or <strong>Prime Same-Day</strong> and, as if by magic, I find my mouse glide toward the Order Now button!</p>
<p><center><img alt="amazon_nespresso" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/amazon_nespresso_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>The closeness of the customer to your delivery environments remains an infrequently used strategy in creating an urgency nudge.</p>
<p>Another dimension of the delivery time nudge is <i>order in the next 4 hours and get it tomorrow with fast shipping!</i></p>
<p>In our instant gratification culture, who can resist that?</p>
<p><i>You are $39 away from overnight shipping</i> has been done to death. (If you are in this category, know that the last “secret” of ecommerce is that figuring out how to weaponize shipping – and free returns – is a powerful conversion increasing engine. Not easy, but your business model has to change to survive.)</p>
<p>But. If you are still in that world—don’t worry, I still love you—know that a behavioral shift from an emphasis on cost to an emphasis on the benefit will make a huge difference. </p>
<p><i>Add another $39 to your order and get your order 48 hours faster!</i></p>
<p>This takes advantage of the person’s location, your warehouse location, and your shipping policy, and frames it all as a positive nudge.</p>
<p>A couple more examples to inspire you.</p>
<p>Love these delicious sandals on Express. My wife thinks I’ll look prettier in the red, I think the Mustard really looks like my color. :)</p>
<p>I love the nudge they have built-in showing how many in my size are in stock (only one!)…</p>
<p><center><img alt="express_sandal_one_in_stock" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/express_sandal_one_in_stock_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>Not wanting to risk it, I click on the Find in Store link you see at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>I get a interstitial that shows me availability of the sandal by geographic location…</p>
<p><center><img alt="express_sandal_location" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/express_sandal_location_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>Here’s the lovely part… I did not have to do anything. Express did a reverse lookup based on my IP Address, matched that with their stores, then checked their ERP system for inventory and got me the answer. All inside one second.</p>
<p>Nudge, nudge!</p>
<p>One more. </p>
<p>Dominos will now deliver a pizza to you wherever you are. Literally wherever. In a park, in the dark woods, under a bridge. They look up your mobile location (with your permission), and they’ll come find you.</p>
<p>Assuming you want pizza that bad. </p>
<p>There are still websites that ask you to choose your country when you land. In this day and age, for the sake of Zeus, I hope that is not you.&#160; But, how inventively are you using the location nudge? </p>
<p>Significantly higher revenue awaits.</p>
<p><b><a name="socialproof"> </a><font color="#ff0080">5. Social cues to the rescue.</font></b></p>
<p>The last couple of months have not been great for social networks. I’m sure something beneficial will come to the entire digital ecosystem from all this. </p>
<p>A minority might believe that the whole social media <i>thing</i> is going to die. It is not. Community and sharing are core to who we are as humans. It is not going to change. (And, you still need a place for guilty pleasures: indulging in the latest Kardashian-West clan developments!)</p>
<p>Stretch your imagination and it is not hard to come up with some super-clever nudges that incorporate <b>aggregate non-PII information</b> that is public. </p>
<p><i>People have shared this blouse 18 times in the last hour on Instagram.</i></p>
<p><i>80 people in California have booked this destination in the last 30 days.</i></p>
<p><i>1,846 Pins for this closet on Pinterest.</i></p>
<p><i>Our most tweeted style of underwear!</i></p>
<p><i>800 plusses on Google+.</i></p>
<p>Ok, so maybe not Google+ (I was genuinely excited about it, I am sad it died). But you get the idea.</p>
<p>Social cues (/proof) can help create a sense of urgency for a whole host of companies. Yet, I bet you’ve rarely seen the use of this aggregated information to deliver nudges.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example of aggregated non-PII based social cue, from, a site you’ve seen me express adoration for in the past, ModCloth. Every product has a little heart sign, visitors to the site vote their love which helps me make more confident decisions…</p>
<p><center><img alt="modcloth_midi_skirt" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/modcloth_midi_skirt_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>ModCloth also allows their customers to contribute something you might consider PII, their photos. These make perhaps the ultimate social proof as I can see the skirt I want (mustard again FTW!) on different body sizes…</p>
<p><center><img alt="modcloth_midi_skirt_user_pictures" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/modcloth_midi_skirt_user_pictures_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>ModCloth has a whole lot of <a href="https://www.modcloth.com/what-we-are-loving" target="_blank">social proof strategies</a>. They have a Style Gallery, #ModClothSquad, #MarriedinModCloth etc.</p>
<p>Think expansively about social proof.</p>
<p><a href="https://us.nakedwines.com/products/carmen-stevens--angels-reserve-sauvignon-blanc-2017" target="_blank">Naked Wines</a> has a lovely widget next to each of their wines that shows the <em>would buy again</em> rate…</p>
<p><center><img alt="naked_wines" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/naked_wines_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>And, they show you historical sales and <em>would buy it again</em> rates.</p>
<p>Checkout the <a href="https://us.nakedwines.com/products/kimbao-sauvignon-blanc-2017" target="_blank">Kimbao Sauvignon Blanc</a> you can see sales and <em>would buy it again</em> rates since 2011. At 91%, the rate is highest this year. Sweet. Add to Basket!</p>
<p>Another team thinking expansively about leveraging social proof are the <a href="https://basecamp.com" target="_blank">excellent folks at Basecamp</a>. If you scroll to the bottom of their web pages you’ll see…</p>
<p><center><img alt="basecamp_customers_trend" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/1bdec6251999_13964/basecamp_customers_trend_thumb.png" /></center></p>
<p>Completely non-PII based social proof, a simple cumulative trend of the number of customers. What better way to convince you to use them than this lovely up and to the right trend?</p>
<p>One final, massively underutilized, social proof nudge for you to consider.</p>
<p>Every smart ecommerce strategy has an individual-level referral program bolted on from the very start. Your current customers refer your products and services to their friends, family, and complete strangers—in exchange for a little benefit for themselves. </p>
<p>It is rare, however, to see the use of that referral information as a nudge. </p>
<p><i>Your friend Alex will receive $5 if you order in the next 24 hours</i>.</p>
<p>The site is keeping track of the referral (to pay your friend Alex his bounty). They have all the information they need to create the above line of text. Why not use it?</p>
<p><i>Read Diana’s review of this product.</i></p>
<p>Diana, of course, referred the product to you, and that insight is in the URL you used to get to the site. The site is simply going the extra mile to surface Diana’s review, as it will likely be more meaningful to you than the other 29.</p>
<p>I love Patagonia; I value the brand’s ethos so deeply. And, when I say love, I mean LOVE. Two of the three pieces of clothing I’m wearing right now are from Patagonia. Yet there does not seem to be any strategy at Patagonia to help me (and you and other brand lovers) to create social cue nudges. </p>
<p>Humans inherently want to share, they want to show off, and they want to pass on recommendations/deals to their community. Got social nudges?</p>
<p><b><a name="yespersonalize"> </a><font color="#ff0080">6. Personalization. Yes, from 1995!</font></b></p>
<p>Do you remember what I did during the last visit to your website? </p>
<p>No PII, just off the anonymous first-party permission-based cookie. Did you use that to change the site’s home page?</p>
<p>And, if you have a GDPR compliant login mechanism…Does your machine learning-powered ecommerce platform leverage the lifetime of my site experience, complaints, purchases, etc., to anticipate my activity?</p>
<p>Do the pages on your site wrap around my objectives, rather than your static and pimpy ones?</p>
<p>Is your entire sales strategy obsessed with the Do, or does it also obsess about the <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/see-think-do-content-marketing-measurement-business-framework/" target="_blank">See, Think and Care bits</a> of the complete human experience?</p>
<p>Personalization is the ultimate nudge—to create ecommerce-related urgency and to bring your brand closer to the customer over the lifetime of their experience with you.</p>
<p>That’s because personalization means truly caring. Personalization requires a huge investment in understanding. Personalization is translating that individual human-level understanding into anticipation. Personalization means helping. And when you do it right, personalization means you pimp with relevance—the best kind. </p>
<p>The desire to personalize across the complete human experiences kicks off the processes that fundamentally alter how you treat every human. The reason it works, when done right, is that deep down, we want people to care about us. And yes, we will end up doing more business with people who show that they care for us. Really care. The ultimate nudge. </p>
<p>So. If you own <a href="http://www.canada.ca">www.canada.ca</a> or <a href="http://www.sainsbury.co.uk">www.sainsbury.co.uk</a> using PII or non-PII information… Does your site actively learn<i> and then change</i>? If not, why not?</p>
<p>One huge challenge we had to overcome in delivering personalization was employee capabilities. Employees are terrible at being able to imagine the expanse of possibilities when it comes being able to understand each human and being able to react to each human. Mercifully, <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/artificial-intelligence-opportunity-camel-to-cars-moment/">Machine Learning (/Artificial Intelligence)</a> will help us solve this challenge with incredible results. </p>
<p><b>Bottom-line.</b></p>
<p>You can pray that your conversion rates increase. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can take advantage of the data you have access to, the permissions your users have given you, and the competitive advantages you’ve worked so hard to create and use them to create nudges that solve for delivering delight to your customers and more revenue to your company. </p>
<p>Your choice?</p>
<p>Nudging FTW!</p>
<p>As always, it is your turn now. </p>
<p>If you’ve tried one of the above six strategies to create a nudge, what was the outcome for your company? If you’ve seen a strategy for creating urgency that you love, will you please share it? What challenges have you run into in trying to personalize experiences? Nudging also works in our personal lives—have you tried it? :)</p>

<p><b>PS:</b> My doctor reminds me during every annual visit that I need to take more walks outside in the sun to make up for a vitamin deficiency. Turns out I spend too much time in my office or auditoriums. The sun is right there. I just need to take a walk. I still do it less than I should. Such is the case with A/B testing. <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/optimize/features/">The tools are free</a> and <a href="https://vwo.com">abundant</a>. You know they are the best way to win arguments with your <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/seven-steps-to-creating-a-data-driven-decision-making-culture/">HiPPOs</a> or your cubicle mates. Yet, you don’t use them. I’m off to take a walk in the beautiful California sun, you go implement my recommendations for nudges as A/B tests—it is the only way to unlock the kind of imagination required to create <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/web-design-user-experience-best-practices/">profitable happy customer experiences</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today something complex, advanced, that is most applicable to those who are at the edges of spending money, and thus have an intricate web of internal and external teams to deliver customer engagement and business success.</p>
<p>The Marketing Industrial Empire is made up of number of components.</p>
<p>If you consider the largest pieces, there is the internal (you, the company) and the external (agencies, consultants).</p>
<p>If you consider entities, you’ve got your media agency, your creative agency, your various advertising agencies, your website and retail store teams, your analysts, marketers, advertising experts, the UX teams, campaign analysts, fulfillment folks, the data analysts who are scattered throughout the aforementioned entities, the CMO, CFO, and hopefully your CEO. And I&#039;m only talking about the small portion of your existence that is your marketing and analytics.</p>
<p>Whether you consider the large, simplistic perspective (internal &#8211; external) or the more complex entity view, it’s really easy to see how things can become siloed very quickly.</p>
<p>It’s so easy for each little piece (you!) to solve for your little piece and optimize for a local maxima. You win (bonus/promotion/award). It is rare that your company wins in these siloed existence.</p>
<p>That’s simply because silos don’t promote consideration of all the variables at play for the business. They don’t result in taking the entire business strategy or the complete customer journey. Mining a cubic zirconia is celebrated as if it is a diamond.</p>
<p>Heartbreakingly, this is very common at large and extra-large sized companies. (This happens a lot less at small companies because of how easily death comes with a local maxima focus.)</p>
<p>So how can you avoid this? How do you encourage broader, more out-of-the-box thinking?</p>
<p>This might seem simplistic, but sometimes it helps to give things names. Naming things clarifies, frames, and when done well it exposes the gaps in our thinking. </p>
<p>Today, I want to name two of the most common silos in large and extra-large companies, in the hope that it’ll force you to see them and subsequently abandon siloed thinking and solve <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/smarter-career-choices-solve-for-global-maxima/">for a global maxima</a>. </p>

<p>Let’s go!</p>
<p><a name="passiveconsumption"> </a>  </p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">The Advertising Ecosystem: Passive Consumption.</font></strong></p>
<p>I&#039;m randomly going to use Geico as an illustrative example because the frequency at which they are buying ads means that every human, animal, and potted plant in the United States has seen a Geico commercial at least once in the last 6 hours (contributing to Geico’s business success).</p>
<p>Typically the ads we see are the result of the external creative and media agencies, and their partners in the internal company team/s. </p>
<p>Geico purchases every kind of ad: TV spots, radio ads, billboards (OOH), digital displays (video, online,– social media), print (magazines, newspaper, your cousin&#039;s Christmas letter), and so much more.</p>
<p>The teams naturally gravitate towards optimization and measurement that spans their individual mini-universes.</p>
<p><em>Was that a great ad? Can we test different spending levels in that market? What is the best way to get people to remember the delightful gecko? Can we automate the placement of display ads based on desired psychographics?</em></p>
<p><em>Did we get the TRPs that we were shooting for? What was the change in awareness and consideration? What was the reach/frequency for the Washington Post? How many impressions did our Twitter ads get, and how many people were exposed to our billboards?</em></p>
<p>These are important questions facets of, and delivery optimization of, the advertising. Questions like these, and adjacent others, tend to drive the entire lives of creative and media agencies/teams. For entirely understandable reasons. Siloed incentives delivering siloed local maxima results.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough that these results can be positive (for the ad business and, in this case, the sales of insurance products). And yet, as a global maxima person it does not take a whole lot of effort to see a whole lot of opportunity if both the siloed incentives can siloed execution implied by the above questions can be changed. </p>
<p>Here’s an incredible simple way that every human seeking global maxima can look beyond the silo: “<em>So, what happens after?</em>”</p>
<p>As in, what happens after the finite confines that are the scope of my responsibility/view?</p>
<p>To see that, the first step is to paint a picture that illustrates the current purpose (your silo), and then give it a name.</p>
<p>Here’s that picture for the example we are using, and the name I gave it is “passive consumption.”</p>
<p><center> <img title="passive consumption" alt="passive_consumption" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Passive-Consumption--Active-Engagement--_1424C/passive_consumption_thumb.png" /></center>
</p>
<p>Over 90% of advertising is passive consumption. This means that the ad is in front of the human and they may see it or not see it.</p>
<p>Even on the platforms where interactivity is at its very core (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.), almost all of the advertising does not elicit any sort of interactivity. If you look at the percentages, almost no one clicks on banner ads, a small percentage on search ads, and you need only speak with a few people around you to see how many people actively engage with TV ads vs. run to the bathroom or pull out their mobile phone the moment forced-watch TV ads come on.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is not a ding against passive consumption or the hard work done by Geico&#039;s agency and internal teams. Blasting ads on TV does cause a teeny tiny micro percentage to buy insurance &#8211; a fact provable via Matched Market Tests, Media Mix Models. The teeny tiny micro infinitesimally small number of views of brand display ads will cause outcomes. (Hold this thought, we’ll come back to that in a moment.)</p>
<p>So, what is the passive consumption challenge?</p>
<p>First, how far the vision of the creative and media agencies/teams will see (thus limiting success – global maxima). Second, trapped in the silo the vision for what will be measured and deemed as success.</p>
<p>The first is heartbreaking. The second ensures the death of any long-term impact. </p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>With over 90% passive consumption…. Well, passive… Smart media and advertising agencies/teams will primarily use post-exposure surveys to measure <strong>awareness</strong> (<em>what companies provide car insurance</em>) and <strong>consideration</strong> (<em>which brands you would consider</em>).</p>
<p>The brilliant agencies will also measure elements such as <strong>purchase intent</strong> (<em>how likely it is that you&#039;ll consider Geico as your next car insurance provider</em>) and <strong>likelihood to recommend</strong> (<em>how likely is it that you&#039;ll recommend Geico to your family and friends</em>). </p>
<p>All of these metrics will cause surveys to be sent via various mediums to people who&#039;ve seen the TV ads, the banners on Facebook, and the video ads on YouTube. And a subset of users who were not exposed to the ads. Usually, there is anywhere between a few hundred to a thousand survey responses that will end up providing a statistically significant sample.</p>
<p>The scores from these responses are presented in weekly, monthly, or quarterly meetings. Segmented by marketing activity, they are the end-all be-all justification for media spending. <em>Snapchat increased <strong>aided awareness</strong> by +23%, let us spend more there. </em>Or, <em>billboards in Georgetown and Austin shifted <strong>purchase intent </strong>by +2%, we should triple our spend in Chicago.</em></p>
<p>Every measurement and optimization initiative is based on this cocktail of metrics. Thus delivering a positive, but local, maxima.</p>
<p>Even the next best innovation in media will be based on results from the same metrics cocktail. Thus delivering a little more positive, but still local, maxima.</p>
<p>Why not global maxima? </p>
<p>Because success is determined by, innovation is driven by, measurement that is <strong>self-reported feelings. </strong></p>
<p>That name captures the actual thing that is being measured (feelings) by the metrics above, and where the data comes from (self-reported) after being exposed to our advertising.</p>
<p>This will help your company, your agencies, understand limits. Limits in terms of what’s happening (mostly, passive consumption) and what data we are looking at (all post-exposure and self-reported).</p>
<p>Limits in measurement that incentivize solving for a local maxima.</p>
<p>Let me repeat one more time. Passive consumption measured by self-reported feelings does drive some success – else Geico would not be the financial success it is. In the short-term some campaigns are trying to drive long-term brand influence or causing a shift in public opinion or simply to remind people your brand still exists as a choice. All good. Self-reported feelings are wonderful. Appreciate that even in those cases where you are not trying to drive short-term sales, if all you have are feelings converted into metrics… You are limiting imagination.</p>
<p>An obsession with just passive consumption by your agencies and internal teams delivers 18 points of success. I’m saying if you think global maxima, remove limits, you can do 88 points!</p>
<p><a name="activeengagement"> </a> </p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">The Business Ecosystem: Active Engagement.</font></strong></p>
<p>Getting those additional 70 points success requires breaking the self-imposed creative/media/advertising silo and caring about the human behavior if people lean-in instead of passive consumption – when they take an action (a click, a phone call, a store visit). </p>
<p>Time to draw another picture, and give this behavior a name. </p>
<p>I call it… drum roll please… Active Engagement! </p>
<p align="center"><img title="active_engagement" alt="active_engagement" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/Passive-Consumption--Active-Engagement--_1424C/active_engagement_thumb.png" /></p>
<p>Some people, between 0.01% to 10% (so rare!), who see Geico’s online ads will visit a Geico retail store or Geico&#039;s website.</p>
<p>People are actually doing something. They are walking into your store, talking to an agent, picking up the literature, calling you on the phone, clicking on to your site, watching videos, comparison shopping, and more. This is all human behavior that your tools can report for you.</p>
<p>A small percentage will end up buying insurance – mazel tov! –, providing perhaps the most valuable data.</p>
<p>The lucky thing about active engagement is that, in addition to self-reported feelings, you also get tons of highly-useful quantitative data representing human behavior. </p>
<p>I call this type of data: <strong>Observed Human Behavior.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a part of an creative, media, or an internal company team, you have two powerful issues you can solve for: passive consumption (happens most of the time) <strong>AND</strong> active engagement (happens some of the time).</p>
<p>Likewise, you can seek to understand performance using self-reported data where the people reflect on how they feel, along with behavior data that represents what they actually do.</p>
<p>The combination of these two factors deliver the much needed Global Maxima perspective. </p>
<p>That is how you shatter silos. The creative agency has to care about how ads perform in their labs, in the real world, and what kind of online and offline behavior the creative is driving (end-to-end baby!). The media agency has to care about the creative and where it needs to get delivered (recency, frequency FTW!), and the bounce rate (70% ouch, 30% hurray!) and profit from each campaign. The retail experience team, the call center delight team, and the site experience team will break their silo and reach back into understanding the self-reported feelings data from the media agencies and the ideas that lead to the creative that delivered a human to them. </p>
<p>Everyone cares about the before and after, solving for the overall business rather than their little silo. Passive consumption plus active engagement equals global maxima. Or, self-reported feelings plus observed human behavior equals global maxima.</p>
<p>: )</p>
<p>Here’s a massively underappreciated benefit: It also encourages every employee &#8211; internal and external &#8211; to take full credit for their impact on the short and long-term effects of their effort.</p>
<p>It is rare to see this happen in real life, even at top American and European companies.</p>
<p>What’s usual is to see the three silos between creative agencies, media agencies, and company internal team. There is usually further sub-segmentation into passive consumption teams (also lovingly referred as brand agencies/advertisers) and active engagement teams (performance agencies/advertisers). The further sub-sub-segmentation into products and services (depending on the company). </p>
<p>They then quickly fall into their respective measurement silos, solving for the local maxima.</p>
<p>Change starts with naming things and drawing pictures. Gather the key leaders at your company and agency partners. Show them passive consumption and self-reported feelings along with active engagement and observed human behavior. Talk through the implications of each picture. Ask this influential audience: <em>What can you contribute to when it comes to breaking silos?</em></p>
<p>I have yet to meet a single company where simply drawing the picture did not result in a dramatic rethinking of focus areas, responsibilities, and ultimately priorities.</p>
<p><p><a name="fivechanges"> </a> <strong><font color="#0000ff">Accelerating Success: Five Quick Changes.</font></strong></p>
<p>Once you have that discussion, what should you do to truly cause a significant change in behavior?</p>
<p> Five <i>Es</i> form the core of the strategies that I end up using (please share your&#039;s via comments below). They are:</p>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">1. Expand the scope of data your employees use.</font></strong></p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<p>For the people who buy your television ads, include both store and website traffic data. Break the shackles of GRPs and Frequency.</p>
<p>For people buying your display ads on Facebook, include page depth, bounce rate, as well as micro-conversion rates for those campaigns. Break the shackles Awareness and Views.</p>
<p>For people buying your videos ads on Hulu, complement Hulu&#039;s self-reported feelings metrics with user behavior and conversion rates. </p>
<p>And continue going in this fashion.</p>
</div>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">2. Expand the incentives structures for your employees.</font></strong></p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<p>Most marketing employees, both internal and external, undertaking passive consumption initiatives are rewarded for cost per TRP, effective reach, awareness and consideration increases, etc. Whatever this bucket as an employee incentive, it can stay. </p>
<p>Consider adding one or two KPIs from active engagement. For example: Store visits, phone calls (as a result of that increase in consideration). Website visits, loyalty, micro-outcomes, and 25 other easily-available observed human behavior metrics are available to you pretty much in real-time.</p>
<p>For people who own responsibility for your stores, call center and website, take a metric or two from passive consumption and make it a small part of their incentive structure. </p>
<p>People respond to what they are compensated with, or promoted for. Use it to solve for a global maxima in the company and its customers.</p>
</div>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">3. Expand the time horizon for success.</font></strong></p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<p>This is really hard. </p>
<p>You buy 100 TRPs, it’s expensive, and the executives tend to start badgering you for immediate results. </p>
<p>The problem is that self-reported feelings data takes time, and since at least 90% of passive consumption leads to no immediate active engagement, all this does is incentivize bad behavior by your agencies and employees. Long-term objectives are thrown onto the chopping block and long-term strategies are judged on short-term success &#8211; which immediately ruins the campaign’s measurement. Oh and the audience being bombarded by your ads that are trying to deliver short-term outcomes from long-term creative and campaigns… They despise you because you are sucking, they can see that, and they instantly realize your are wasting their time. </p>
<p>No matter how much your wish, a Chicken won’t birth a Lion’s cub. </p>
<p>If you want short-term success, define the clearly as a goal, pick the right short-term self-reported feelings metric and observed behavior metric, now unleash your creative agency and their ideas (on that short-term horizon), then plead with your media agency to buy optimal placements, and ensure the retail/phone/web experience is not some soft and fuzzy experience, rather it is tied to that clear goal and success metrics. Sit back. Win.</p>
<p>If you want long-term success… Same as above, replace short with long. How amazing is that? </p>
</div>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">4. Expand the datasets that teach your smart algorithms.</font></strong></p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<p>If you’ve only visited this blog once in the last 12 months, or read just one edition of <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/marketing-analytics-intersect-newsletter/" target="_blank">my truly amazing newsletter :)</a>, Marketing &lt;&gt; Analytics Intersect, it is quite likely I have infected you with the passion to <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/artificial-intelligence-opportunity-camel-to-cars-moment/" target="_blank">start investing in machine learning</a> in order to bring smart automation to your marketing and user-experience initiatives. </p>
<p>If you are following my advice, make absolutely sure that you are not training your algorithms based solely on passive consumption, self-reported feelings data. It is necessary, but not sufficient. </p>
<p>Rich observed behavior data will provide your algorithm the same broad view of success as we are trying to provide the humans in #2 above. In fact, the algorithms can ingest way more data and complexity. Thus allowing them to solve for a super-global maxima compared to our humble abilities. </p>
<p>Every algorithm is only as smart as the data you use to educate it. Don&#039;t short-change the algorithm.</p>
</div>
<p><strong><font color="#008000">5. Expand leadership comfort level with ambiguity.</font></strong></p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<p>For your TV efforts, there are limits to what you can measure. You have self-reported feelings data, and usually that’s about it. If you have a sophisticated world-class measurement team, you may be running some controlled experiments to measure one or two elements of active engagement observed human behavior data.</p>
<p>For YouTube or Hulu on the other hand, you’ll have additional self-reported feelings data, and if you follow my advice today, plenty of directly-causal observed human behavior data at your disposal.</p>
<p>Get very comfortable with this reality, and execute accordingly.</p>
<p>When some executives are not comfortable with this reality, they typically end up gravitating towards the lowest common denominator. Even in regards to strategies where more is possible (digital), they just end up using self-reported feelings data for everything.</p>
<p>I do understand why this is; executives are pressed for time, so the executive dashboard needs only one metric they can compare across initiatives. This instantly <em>dumbs-down</em> the intelligence that could help contribute to smarter decisions.</p>
<p>Kindly explain this to your executives, share with them the value of being comfortable with a little ambiguity that comes from using the best metric for each initiative type. </p>
<p>We can achieve smarter global maxima decisions if we just use different metrics in some instances.</p>
</div>
<p><p><a name="closingthoughts"> </a> <strong><font color="#0000ff">Closing Thoughts.</font></strong></p>
<p>The larger the company, the harder it is to solve for a global maxima. Companies need command and control. Companies worry that people are going to run wild in 15 different directions. Companies need to reward an individual, that means creating a finite role that can be defined and measured at a small level. Companies add layers upon layers to <em>manage</em>. Companies create org clusters (divisions). And, more.</p>
<p>Every one of these actions forces a local maxima. Every human can see their few pixels and have no idea what the image looks like. </p>
<p>Even if then the company progresses little by little, they’ll run out of luck one day. Worse some nimble small company – that does not yet have to worry about all of the above – will come eat your breakfast first, then dinner and then lunch. </p>
<p>The lesson in this post applies across the entire business, even if in this instance it is applied to marketing and advertising. </p>
<p>Paint a picture of what the local maxima execution looks like in your division – or better still company. Give these pieces a name. Then, figure out, like I’ve done above, what the connective tissue is that’ll incentivize global maxima thinking and execution.</p>
<p>Carpe diem!</p>
<p>As always, it is your turn now. </p>
<p>In your specific role, are you solving for the global maxima or a local maxima? How about your creative and media agencies? Your internal marketing or product teams? Has your company done something special to ensure that teams are considering both self-reported feelings and observed human behavior? Is there a magic metric you feel that’ll encourage each piece of the business success puzzle to solve for a global maxima?</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I worry about data’s <em>last-mile gap</em> a lot. As a lover of data-influenced decision making, perhaps you worry as well.</p>
<p>A lot of hard work has gone into collecting the requirements and implementation. An additional massive investment was made in the effort to perform ninja like analysis. The end result was a collection trends and insights. </p>
<p>The <em>last-mile gap </em>is the distance between your trends and getting an influential company leader to take action. </p>
<p>Your biggest asset in closing that <em>last-mile gap</em> is the way you present the data. </p>
<p>On a slide. On a dashboard in Google Data Studio. Or simply something you plan to sketch on a whiteboard. This presentation of the data will decide if your trends and insights are understood, accepted and inferences drawn as to what action should be taken.</p>
<p>If your data presentation is good, you reduce the <em>last-mile gap</em>. If your data presentation is confusing/complex/wild, all the hard work that went into collecting the data, analyzing it, digging for context will all be for naught.</p>
<p>With the benefits so obvious, you might imagine that the <em>last-mile gap</em> is not a widely prevalent issue. I’m afraid that is not true. I see reports, dashboards, presentations with wide gaps. It breaks my heart, because I can truly appreciate all that hard work that went into creating work that resulted in no data-influence. </p>
<p>Hence today, one more look at this pernicious problem and a collection of principles you can apply to close the <em>last-mile gap</em> that exists at your work.</p>
<p>For our lessons today, I’m using an example that comes from analysis delivered by the collective efforts of a top American university, a top 5 global consulting company, and a major industry association. The analysis is publicly available. </p>
<p>I’ve chosen to block out the name of entities involved. <em>Last-mile gaps</em> exist at all our companies. It is not important where this 2018 analysis came from. In the tiny chance that you recognize the source, I request you to <strong>keep it out</strong> of your comments as well.</p>
<p>For each of the 17 examples we review, I’ll share an alternative version I created. I invite you to play along and share your version of any of the examples. I’ll add them to the post, and credit you.</p>
<p>Ready? </p>
<p>Let’s go!</p>
<p>I persistently advocate for simplicity in slides. <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/storytelling-with-data-simplify-focus-visualize-outcomes/#nohandouts" target="_blank">Don’t create handouts!</a></p>
<p>In this case the goal was to create handouts, perhaps to make it easier for audiences to consume the data by themselves. I would humbly still advocate for simplicity when it comes to data presentation. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/optimistic_economy.png"><img title="optimistic_economy_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="optimistic_economy_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/optimistic_economy_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="471" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the fixes to solve for simplicity could be to use fewer sprinkles, a simpler header – graphics and text –, and we can be very selective about what’s on he slide. As you look at the slide, I’m sure you’ll come up with other ways in which we can liberate the white space for the tyranny of text/colors.</p>
<p>Solving for simplicity contributes to communication effectiveness. It of course reflects on your brand, and, most of all, helps you have better control over the story you are trying to tell.</p>
<p>For the rest of this post I’ll ignore the simplicity and storytelling elements and focus exclusively on the data itself. How, what, why and instead of.</p>
<p>Look at the graph above, and the little table… Ponder for a moment what you would do to close the <em>last-mile gap</em> and help the essential message shine through.</p>
<p>Here are some things that stood out for me:</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">1. Graphing choices can exaggerate or undersell reality.</font> </strong></p>
<p>One way to exaggerate is to start your y-axis at 40, as it the case above. The resulting line exaggerates the trend and ends up implying something that might not quite be there. </p>
<p>Start at zero. Please.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">2. False precision can cause clutter, and undercut the Analyst’s brilliance.</font> </strong></p>
<p>This is very subtle. </p>
<p>You’ll notice that the numbers on the graph are expressed with one decimal point. As in 47.7, 56.5, etc. If you pause and consider how this data is collected, via a small triple digit sample self-reported survey results, you’ll quickly realize that the error range in this data is likely a few points. If that’s true, showing the .6, .5 is implying a precision that simply does not exist. </p>
<p>Besides, this false precision also clutters the graph.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">3. Remove the distractions, ruthlessly.</font></strong></p>
<p>In an 11-year span, each data point is a lot less important than the trend. Do you need the dots on the graph? Do you even need the numbers for the individual months?</p>
<p>When it comes to closing the <em>last-mile gap</em> it is helpful to have a ruthless streak. It is helpful because in service of our ultimate objective, you’ll have to kill some of your favorite things, you’ll have push back against your boss/peers who might love clutter, and you might have to help change an entire culture. Hard, painful, work. But, immensely worth it.</p>
<p>Here’s an alternative way to present the data, using nothing more than the standard settings in good old Excel:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/optimistic_economy_v2.png"><img title="optimistic_economy_v2_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="optimistic_economy_v2_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/optimistic_economy_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>It shows the trend, simply. You can see it is up broadly over eleven years. That it was under 50 and is now close to 70. </p>
<p>Did you notice the trend is not as exaggerated as the original? And, still effective! </p>
<p>You might use a different font, perhaps have the graph be smaller, or maybe twist the month-year in the other direction. No problem. I’m confident if you apply the first three filters, whatever you create will close the <em>last-mile gap</em> better.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of doing exactly the opposite of principle #1. The y-axis is artificially set at 100%, as a result the trend is understated.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_sales.png"><img title="customer_sales_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="customer_sales_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_sales_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="469" /></a></p>
<p>You don’t need to go this far. </p>
<p>Just let your favorite graphing tool auto-set the major and minor-axis, which will result in the graph looking like this…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_sales_v2.png"><img title="customer_sales_v2_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="customer_sales_v2_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_sales_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Simple. No funny business.&#160; </p>
<p>The trend stands by itself waiting your words as to why it is meaningful.</p>
<hr color="#008000" width="90%" />
<p> </p>
<p>This next one is pretty interesting. My request to you is to not scroll beyond the slide. Pause. Absorb the graph. Try to understand what the author is really trying to say.</p>
<p>For bonus points, consider the perspective of the person reading this graph rather than the person who created it.</p>
<p>Read. Don’t scroll. Absorb.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_priorities.png"><img title="customer_priorities_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="customer_priorities_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_priorities_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="470" /></a></p>
<p>How well did you understand the trend and the insight being communicated? What would you have done differently if you’d created the graph?</p>
<p>Here are some things that stood out for me:</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">4. Show as much data as is required, and no more.</font></strong></p>
<p>The goal in the original seems to be to show top priorities for 12 months. If so, is the data for August 2017 really adding value? </p>
<p>Often we want to show all the data we have (after all we spent time collecting it!). In this case, it get’s in the way of understanding the 12 month shift.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">5. Experiment with visualization options, even in Excel!</font></strong></p>
<p>We have five dimensions of data, and two data points each (if you apply principle #4). We want the audience to be able to compare two data points for each dimension, and look across all five dimensions.</p>
<p>The bar chart is a sub-optimal way to let the audience <em>see</em> this. Consider experimenting with different visuals in Excel (<a href="https://d3js.org" target="_blank">or D3js</a>).</p>
<p>I applied the radar chart to this data, and got this lovely end result…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_priorities_v2.png"><img title="customer_priorities_v2_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="customer_priorities_v2_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/customer_priorities_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="499" /></a></p>
<p>It is ten million times easier to <em>see</em> the two data points for five dimensions, and realize that only two have changed.</p>
<p>Likewise, the overall trend also pops out at you so much easier in this case. </p>
<p>It would have taken ten minutes for us to explain the data and trend in the original. We can do that in five seconds now. You can use the time remaining discussing why this trend is material and what to do about it (if anything). Actually allowing data to play its natural role: Influence decisions.</p>
<hr color="#008000" width="90%" />
<p></p>
<p>This is a really nice example of a lesson that we tend to forget all the time (myself included).</p>
<p>You know the exercise by now. Pause, reflect on this slide, then scroll.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_budgets_growth.png"><img title="marketing_budgets_growth_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="marketing_budgets_growth_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_budgets_growth_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="471" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s what stood out for me: </p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">6. Don’t send a graphic to do a table’s job.</font></strong></p>
<p>In this case, we are comparing two simple data points, on two dimensions (past, present). Why do we need a graph taking up all the space?</p>
<p>Why not just have a table that shows previous 12 months as 7.1% and a row under it with next 12 months as 8.9%?</p>
<p>Even better, why not just have one line of text: </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<em>Percent change in marketing budgets = +1.8 PP</em>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Why have two fat bars? </p>
<p>Once you arrive at that conclusion, you’ll apply principle #4 and realize that the most interesting data on this slide is not the visual… Rather, it is the table on the top right corner of the slide.</p>
<p>Bada, bing, bada, boom, ten seconds later here’s your slide:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_budgets_growth_v2.png"><img title="marketing_budgets_growth_v2_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="marketing_budgets_growth_v2_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_budgets_growth_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>A simple table with a touch of colors that draws out the core message simply, directly and quickly. </p>
<p>The lighter shade for the core numbers will result in them being pushed a bit into the background. This simple choice guides the reader’s eyes gently to the delta (the most important bit).</p>
<p>I like playing with the borders a bit, as you see above. You might have other things you are picky about. And, that is ok. :)</p>
<p>To illustrate principle #6, here’s another slide where the graphic is completely unnecessary:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/spending_on_marketing.png"><img title="spending_on_marketing_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="spending_on_marketing_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/spending_on_marketing_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="471" /></a></p>
<p>A tiny table with two data points will do just fine. </p>
<p>Here’s a bonus lesson for the analysis ninjas out there. Please don’t imply a linear trend between “current levels” and “next three years.” There is no indication that data from 2017 to 2020 is available, and it is highly unlikely that it will follow a linear trend. This is another example of breaking principle #1.</p>
<p>(Let’s not lose sight of the big picture: I am delighted that spending on analytics is going to increase that much! As our leaders spend this largesse, I hope that they’ll remember <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/the-10-90-rule-for-magnificient-web-analytics-success/" target="_blank">the 10/90 rule</a> to ensure optimal returns. The money needs to go to you!)</p>
<hr color="#008000" width="90%" />
<p> </p>
<p>This one flummoxed me. </p>
<p>Let’s see if you can internalize what is going on. Stare at the graph intently, seriously, and see if you get the points…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/consumer_services.png"><img title="consumer_services_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="consumer_services_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/consumer_services_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="469" /></a></p>
<p>Bold items naturally catch the eye, in this case the blue bars. Most people in the western world look from left to right, that is how you’ll likely try and understand what’s going on. </p>
<p>Your first impression will likely be that the blue bars are showing a random trend in marketing spending. </p>
<p>If you are the curious type you’ll realize that is the wrong conclusion, and you’ll want to understand what’s really going on. Soon enough you’ll get to the x-axis and a carefully review will illuminate that the reason for the weirdness is the choice to show the industry names alphabetically!</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">7. Please, please, please keep the end-user in mind.</font></strong></p>
<p>In this case the end-users (our senior leaders) would be primarily be interested in understanding where marketing spending is highest and lowest. This is very difficult to accomplish above. </p>
<p>Secondarily, they’ll want to know where they fall in context of all other industries, this is almost impossible to accomplish above. </p>
<p>The reason the x-axis is organized alphabetically is to allow you to look up your specific industry easily. This thought is good. My hypothesis is that it likely forms a small percent of the use cases, primarily because just knowing your spend is not that valuable. What’s valuable are the above two use cases. </p>
<p>Here’s what I recommend keeping front of mind: <em>If a non-analyst is looking at the data, what uses cases form the basis of the value they’ll extract</em>. Then, ensure the info viz is solving for that.</p>
<p>In this case the bars with the data seem to be randomly sorted. The visualization is getting in the way, creating a wider <em>last-mile gap</em>. </p>
<p>Luckily this is a quick fix in good old Excel. Two minutes later, you’ll have a little waterfall…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/consumer_services_v2.png"><img title="consumer_services_v2_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="consumer_services_v2_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/consumer_services_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="458" /></a></p>
<p>It is easy to see the outliers and the pack of eight that are close to each other (something you can’t even see in the original). </p>
<p>It will certainly take an extra couple of seconds to find your industry, but in service of the two bigger use cases,&#160; it is a small price to pay.</p>
<p>You can play with the layout to your heart’s content. If you dislike waterfalls for some reason and prefer towers…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/consumer_services_v3.png"><img title="consumer_services_v3_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="consumer_services_v3_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/consumer_services_v3_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>I like the waterfall, but this is not bad. :)</p>
<p>Play with the colors, drop shadows, fonts, and more. Make the graph your own. Just don’t forget to look at it through the eyes of the end user and solve for their use cases.</p>
<p>(Speaking of colors… I’m partial to chart styles 17 through 24 in Excel. In my work you’ll see a particular affection for style 18.) </p>
<hr color="#008000" width="90%" />
</p>
<p>I hate pie charts. I really do.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eat-pies-dont-share-them-avinash-kaushik/" target="_blank">read a 506 word love-letter</a> to my profound dislike (including a lovely exercise you can do). </p>
<p>Here’s the scientific reason: </p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Comparison by angle is significantly more difficult than by length.
</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>That is well on display below…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketers_talent.png"><img title="marketers_talent_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="marketers_talent_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketers_talent_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="470" /></a></p>
<p>The colors in the pie will catch your eye. Yet, from the sizes of the slices it is difficult to internalizes the differences between each dimension.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">8. Eat Pies, Don&#039;t Share Them!</font></strong></p>
<p>Since humans find comparing lengths much easier, it should only take a few minutes to take the data and convert the slide above into something that closes the <em>last-mile gap</em> efficiently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketers_talent_v2.png"><img title="marketers_talent_v2_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="marketers_talent_v2_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketers_talent_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="471" /></a></p>
<p>The above slide is a good example how to apply all the principles you’ve learned thus far. The question and the data are the hero, almost all by themselves. Allowing you to focus sharply on your story.</p>
<p>Scroll up and down and compare the two slides. You’ll see many more differences.</p>
<hr color="#008000" width="90%" />
</p>
<p>I’ve extoled the virtue of using a table, instead of trying to be extra sexy and throwing in a graphic.</p>
<p>The challenge with tables is that they can become overwhelming very quickly.</p>
<p>Here’s an example that illuminates that clearly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences.png"><img title="sector_differences_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="sector_differences_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="471" /></a></p>
<p>It feels like there is a lot. It also breaks principle #2, false precision,&#160; which makes things worse. </p>
<p>Considering the core message the analysis is trying to send, I believe that it is also breaking rule #4, extra perhaps unnecessary data.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">9. Make your tables pop, guide the reader’s eye.</font></strong></p>
<p>There are numerous tools available to you inside Excel to make your tables pop. I usually start by playing with the options at my disposal under Conditional Formatting.</p>
<p>One straight-forward option is to use Color Scales, green to yellow, to produce a simpler table that pops…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v2.png"><img title="sector_differences_v2_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="sector_differences_v2_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>The elimination of the overall average makes the table tighter. </p>
<p>It is easier to look at the trend in each column. What’s even more delightful is the second use case of comparing the highs and lows across the four dimensions. So much easier.</p>
<p>While all the data is still there, most senior leaders want to understand trends and the contrasts. They want relative positioning, the above table does not require expending too many brain cells to get that. And, if your boss does not trust you… She still has the numbers there. </p>
<p>Notice the combination of fonts, colors, style treatments, in the table above. Bunch of subtle points there.</p>
<p>If your personal tastes are different, no problem. There are other styles you can use.</p>
<p>Here’s the data rendered using solid fill Data Bars…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v3.png"><img title="sector_differences_v3_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="sector_differences_v3_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v3_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>In this case I feel data bars add clutter, but they make internalizing the trend across individual dimensions easier.</p>
<p>If, like me, you are biased towards radical simplicity via white space, you can keep the table. Consider applying some subtle font color treatment to create something that’s still a step change over the original…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v4.png"><img title="sector_differences_v4_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="sector_differences_v4_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v4_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve shown the highs and lows in a way that you’ll <em>see</em> them quickly. </p>
<p>Red was chosen on purpose to emphasize that it was the most important thing from the customer’s perspective. Blue fades into the background a bit because it is the least important.</p>
<p>One final touch.</p>
<p>I felt it might be of value to see the product and services dimensions together, comparing them across B2B and B2C.</p>
<p>Here’s that version…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v5.png"><img title="sector_differences_v5_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="sector_differences_v5_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/sector_differences_v5_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="234" /></a></p>
<p>There’s a little air gap in the table to emphasize the two comparisons are different. You can usually use visual cues like these to help the consumers of your analysis.</p>
<hr color="#008000" width="90%" />
<p></p>
<p>We disagree on a whole lot of subjects in our country these days, but the one thing we can all agree on is that the human attention span is probably ten micro-seconds. </p>
<p>Add to that short attention span the fact that each executive has 18 other urgent things taking up their brain cells. As if all that was not hard enough, while you are presenting they are also likely on their phone or laptop.</p>
<p>Persuading anyone in these circumstances is a herculean task. </p>
<p>With that context in mind, how many leaders do you think will understand what’s going on here…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_knowledge.png"><img title="marketing_knowledge_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="marketing_knowledge_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_knowledge_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>4 dimensions x 5 time periods x crazy swings = Ouch!</p>
<p>For bonus points, notice the randomness in the x-axis. It jumps from 2014 to 2017 without any visible explanation. To make things worse, look at the trend lines – they connect the two data points to imply a trend between 2015, 2016 that may or may not exist.</p>
<p>For even more bonus points, notice that there are four Februaries and as if it is no big deal an August is thrown in randomly.</p>
<p>Ouch. Ouch.</p>
<p>These might seem like small issues, but I assure you that you’ll instantly lose credibility with any intelligent leader in the room. They won’t raise their hand and start to berate you. They’ll quietly make a mental note about you, and then not pay any attention to anything you are saying. </p>
<p>There’s an even more important principle to learn from this visual…</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">10. Let the <i>higher order bit </i>be your north star.</font></strong></p>
<p>It can be difficult to figure out how to go from the complex to the simple.&#160; My recommendation is to start with the most important thing you are trying to say. </p>
<p>In this instance the goal is to illuminate the percent change in marketing knowledge in the next 12 months. So, are the rest of the data points necessary and of value?</p>
<p>In service of the <em>higher order bit</em>, I would argue that we can also get rid of the two Februaries and the lonely August. (Though I sincerely respect the effort it took to get those data points.)</p>
<p>With those decisions we are left with just two data points. We can move to a simple table and close the <em>last-mile </em>gap by creating this slide…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_knowledge_v2.png"><img title="marketing_knowledgem" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_knowledge_v2_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="471" /></a></p>
<p>Simpler, right?</p>
<p>We can do one better. </p>
<p>If the objective is to just show the change, we can just show the percentage change.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_knowledge_v3.png"><img title="marketing_knowledge_v3_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="marketing_knowledge_v3_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/marketing_knowledge_v3_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="470" /></a></p>
<p>The colors help focus the attention even more.</p>
<p>To see the dramatic change, scroll back up and look at the original and then come back here. Incredible, right? </p>
<p>It might seem that this is hard work that takes time. It does take more time. But, it is not in the <em>ink</em> rather it is in the <em>think</em>. Discussing, debating, really thinking through what we are trying to communicate. The visualizing part takes a lot less time.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this type of analysis, compiled into 95 slides, is that it never answers the question <i>why</i>?</p>
<p>Take this slide as an example. It shares a very positive view of analytics…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/analytics_spend.png"><img title="analytics_spend_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="analytics_spend_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/analytics_spend_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="472" /></a></p>
<p>The slide breaks all ten principles we’ve discussed in this post, but beyond that there is a bigger problem here. </p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">11. Why. Your job is to answer <i>why!</i></font></strong></p>
<p>Your first instinct is the marvel at the shift (all blues are up!), and reflect on how this graph is long-term job security for everyone who reads this blog.&#160; But, you’re an Analyst and that good feeling won’t last. </p>
<p>Your mind quickly goes to… <i>Why?</i> What is causing this shift? </p>
<p>Look at Mining/Construction, 60 percent points of change. OMG! <i>Why?</i></p>
<p>The entity creating this report sadly never answers any <i>why</i> question anywhere. Perhaps by design. </p>
<p>But, consider this: Data creates curiosity. If the Analyst does not satiate that curiosity via deeper analysis that explains <em>why</em>, the same data turns into a disappointment. It certainly drives no change.</p>
<p>I’ve written about this topic before, using an example from Econsultancy and Lynchpin: <a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/survey-results-impact-abandon-asker-puker-model/" target="_blank">Smarter Survey Results and Impact: Abandon the Asker-Puker Model!</a></p>
<p>Without the <em>why</em> your <em>last-mile gap</em> is a million miles wide. If you are going to be in the data regurgitation business, please consider it your job to answer the <i>why </i>question. Without it all this is… <i>fake news</i>.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#0000ff">A challenge for you to tackle.</font></strong></p>
<p>Now that you are aware of the 11 principles that aid in closing the <em>last-mile gap</em>, I want you to tackle something on my behalf.</p>
<p>I had not idea what to do with this slide… Can you create an after version?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/product_service_org.png"><img title="product_service_org_sm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="product_service_org_sm" src="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/wp-content/uploads/2017/e9c1891af7b2_5B47/product_service_org_sm_thumb.png" width="625" height="470" /></a></p>
<p>Partly the issue is that I could not truly internalize what was being said. Partly it is that the numbers don’t really seem to change much. Partly it is because I was torn between the graphic and the table on the top right. </p>
<p>Regardless, I gave up. Perhaps you can teach me, and our readers, what a version with a reduced <em>last-mile gap</em> will look like.</p>
<p>Just email me your version (blog at kaushik dot net) or comment below.</p>
<p> Here’s a summary of the 11 principles you can use to close the <em>last-mile gap</em>:</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
01<font color=red><b>.</b></font> Graphing choices can exaggerate or undersell reality. <br />
02<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  False precision can cause clutter, and undercut the Analyst’s brilliance.<br />
03<font color=red><b>.</b></font> Remove the distractions, ruthlessly.<br />
04<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Show as much data as is required, and no more.<br />
05<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Experiment with visualization options, even in Excel!<br />
06<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Don’t send a graphic to do a table’s job.<br />
07<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Please, please, please keep the end-user in mind.<br />
08<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Eat Pies, Don&#039;t Share Them!<br />
09<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Make your tables pop, guide the reader’s eye.<br />
10<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Let the <i>higher order bit </i>be your north star.<br />
11<font color=red><b>.</b></font>  Why. Your job is to answer <i>why!</i>

<p></p>
<p><p>I wish you smaller gaps and more decisions that are data-influenced. </p>
<p>As always, it is your turn now. </p>
<p>In your practice, how wide is the <em>last-mile gap</em>? What do you think contributes to the gap the most? Which of the above principles have you used, to good effect? Do you have a favorite principle, or five, to close the gap? If you had to kill one practice when it comes to data presentation, who would be the chosen candidate?</p>
<p>Please share versions of the above examples that you’ve taken a crack at fixing. And, your lessons, best practices, and as always your critique via comments below.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
