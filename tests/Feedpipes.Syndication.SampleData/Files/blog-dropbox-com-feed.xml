<p>We?re constantly looking for ways to improve the Dropbox experience. This year we?ve announced <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product-tips/new-dropbox">new </a><a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product-tips/new-dropbox">features</a>, partnerships, and the <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-is-acquiring-hellosign-to-improve-document-workflows-for">a</a><a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-is-acquiring-hellosign-to-improve-document-workflows-for">cquisition</a><a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-is-acquiring-hellosign-to-improve-document-workflows-for"> of HelloSign</a>. To support these improvements, we?ve made a few updates to our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Dropbox Business Agreement. Here?s a summary of the key additions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Terms of Service. </b>On June 11, we unveiled the new Dropbox. Our mission is to offer a robust collaborative workspace that helps users find, retrieve, organize, and prioritize their files, collaborate with others, and stay focused on their most important work. To better align with that mission and the new Dropbox, our revised Terms outline that our Services provide ?features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork.? We?ve also revised our beta terms to include a confidentiality provision and to allow Dropbox to solicit feedback from beta participants.</li>
<li><b>Privacy Policy</b>. We?ve updated our Privacy Policy to include more details on what personal data we collect and how we use it. For instance, our Privacy Policy now explains how Dropbox shares data with companies that it acquires (like HelloSign) and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/app-integrations/">other ecosystem partners</a> that offer integrations for Dropbox users. We?ve also revised our Privacy Shield attestation so that data transfers from the UK to the US will continue to be covered by our Privacy Shield certification if the UK leaves the European Union.</li>
<li><b>Dropbox Business Agreement. </b>We?ve updated our Business Agreement to make it easier to follow and to ensure that it best reflects the functionality of the Dropbox Services. For instance, we?ve reorganized and consolidated our terms so our customers can easily see how Dropbox handles and protects their data as well as included clarifications in the event the UK leaves the European Union. We?ve also added language to address current and soon-to-be added functionality of the Services, including federated administration and beta services. Finally, we?ve made the agreement flexible to allow Customers to purchase new services besides Dropbox Business through a single order form or page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the past year, I?ve been fascinated by the debates about <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/open-office-layouts" target="_blank">open office layouts</a>, and equally intrigued by the tips for staying mindful amid a deluge of distractions. Managers tell us we need to collaborate. Professors tell us we need to <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/cal-newport-finding-focus">find </a><a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/cal-newport-finding-focus" target="_blank">focus</a>. How do we balance the need for both? </p>
<p>The answer may not be as easy as bringing back the cubicle. Even an office with a door wouldn?t be an oasis from virtual interruptions. Now that new tech tools have made us endlessly accessible, the way we feel about communicating with co-workers has changed. </p>
<p>Texting made phone calls feel intrusive. Chat apps made email feel more like a chore. Turning off notifications makes it easier to dodge distractions?but is it really helping us get into a flow state, or is it just helping us create ever-more-isolated silos? </p>
<p>Jennifer Brook has been <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/how-modern-teams-want-to-work" target="_blank">interviewing people around the world</a> as a Staff Researcher at Dropbox. In her conversations with knowledge workers of all kinds, she learned how they tend to toggle between two work environments. </p>

<p>?We saw a lot of people express this idea that the optimal time in office is two to three days a week and the optimal time to work from home was two to three days a week,? says Brook. ?So there was this interesting pattern where people were saying ?I really do enjoy being in the office, but I?m unable to work on things that require focus.??<br />
</p>
<p>And <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/10/why-you-can-focus-in-a-coffee-shop-but-not-in-your-open-office" target="_blank">research shows</a> the distractions in open offices are often to blame. One reason is that when people in your office are talking, they're often talking about things that you're interested in hearing. As author David Barkus puts it in <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/10/why-you-can-focus-in-a-coffee-shop-but-not-in-your-open-office" target="_blank"><i>Harvard Business Review</i></a><i>:</i></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><i>?The quiet chatter of colleagues and the gentle thrum of the HVAC should help us focus. The problem may be that, in our offices, we can?t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others? conversations or from being interrupted while we?re trying to focus.?</i></p>
<p>To prevent these interruptions, people use external signaling?such as headphones?so they can do the heads-down work at their desk. But this causes frustration when co-workers want to interact. Consequently, team managers often play a gatekeeping role.</p>
<p>?They maintain a boundary around their team so that they can focus. They are the organizational interface, providing a layer of protection and support for the people working in their teams,? says Brook. ?In that way, it can reframe the conversation about silos into one about boundaries. Teams and groups within organizations, particularly large ones, need boundaries. But then they also need people who can support information and requests in ways that are mutually beneficial and serve both their team and the organization.?</p>

<p>The question is: How do you create flexible boundaries without disrupting flow? </p>
<p>Many point to the way <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html" target="_blank">Bell Labs designed a space</a> to promote a cross-pollination of ideas. ?The research scientists had their own labs and their own rooms and offices,&quot; says Brook. &quot;But they couldn't go anywhere else in the building without engaging in a very long walk in this hallway in which they would inevitably meet other scientists, other researchers along the way and bump into them. There was this sort of serendipity built into the architecture of the space.?</p>
<p>It allowed for the kind of ?<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/is-your-company-encouraging-employees-to-share-what-they-know" target="_blank">coactive</a><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/is-your-company-encouraging-employees-to-share-what-they-know"> vicarious learning</a>? that helps people apply what they learned, and improves the way knowledge is shared across the organization. </p>
<p>?How can an organization support people in teams to both have boundaries for the sake of protecting their focus and to allow some <i>permeability</i>,? asks Brook. ?For ideas to generate, for people to work on things that maybe aren't sanctioned, to find things that they're interested in, other people or groups to engage with?? </p>
<p>Workers don?t have to wait for their manager or a gatekeeper to step in or their company to make cultural changes. Brook says there are various strategies individuals and teams can experiment with<i> to</i> protect their focus while remaining open to collaboration.</p>

<p>?Many of the conversations from the research we did last summer have had a strong influence on how I've organized my life and work in the past year,? Brook says. ?One way I've chosen to do that is my calendar. I outsource the boundary setting to my calendar because it?s my interface to the organization.?</p>
<p>?What I've tried to do is to have three days a week where I discourage people from putting time on my calendar and two days a week where I encourage it. For some reason, this method of three days heads down, two days engaged, has worked shockingly well.?</p>
<p>Brook started to notice that other people in the organization were making their calendars private, and that inspired her to do the same in the name of taking control of her schedule.</p>
<p>?It's like having these blocks of time that I can then fill in with the sort of hours of labor I need to put into the kind of work that I'm doing,? Brook explains. ?It's that idea of the permeable boundary, right? I want anyone in the organization to feel like they can have a conversation with me or put time on my calendar.?</p>
<p>Brook says the simple calendar adjustment has had an impact on how others approach her regarding meetings. ?If someone doesn't know me, they'll often reach out to ask permission and set context. It's a more respectful interaction. If you have a nice garden and you have a fence around it, people aren't just taking the tomatoes. They might ask you first before they do it.?</p>
<p>Once you?ve agreed to take on the meeting, though, there?s another important decision to make: how much of your day should you devote to it? </p>
<p>&quot;Our calendars have decided that the hour is a default unit of time,? says Brook. ?I believe the defaults within the products funnel our time and attention in specific ways. That hour as a default meeting unit is, I think, absurd. Any hour of time that I'm spending in conversation with another person requires about an hour to prepare, then an hour to process. So a one-hour meeting often represents three to four hours of labor.? </p>
<p>As a result, we wind up with less and less time to do the work we need to do on our own. So how do we make room for that?on our calendars and in our offices? </p>
<p>Open offices aren?t the collaborative utopia employers hoped they would be, but they seem to be <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90285582/everyone-hates-open-plan-offices-heres-why-they-still-exist" target="_blank">our reality for foreseeable future</a>. Until we enter a new office design paradigm, here?s what workers can do: Hone your skills for staying focused and improvise ways to protect your time. Because even if you can?t control your environment, you <i>can</i> take control of your boundaries.  </p>

<p>On a cold winter morning, in January, 2019, serial startup founder Sonya Lee lay on her couch in her small apartment. Her back muscles had seized and the smallest movement sent searing pain rattling down her spine. Her breathing was shallow, her heart rate raised, and her brow damp with a clammy sweat. Behind her eyes, Lee was trying to make sense of the chaos that had got her here?but she couldn?t. She was mentally and physically exhausted, her morale drained and her body pushed to the point of failure. In her depths of despair, Lee didn?t suspect this moment would set her life on a course for recovery. But it would.</p>
<h2>Living the startup grind</h2>
<p>Lee was the quintessential startup founder: a scrappy entrepreneur who worked 12 hours a day and answered emails in her sleep?and she?d been living that life for quite some time. After leaving her job as an art director at Walt Disney, Lee had founded and run several different businesses: a private mentorship community, a design agency, a design consultancy, and a comparison website. Long nights, early mornings, and constant stress about funding, recruitment, and traction were all just part of the job.<br />
<br />
But after several years in the startup grind, things started to change. ?It got to a point where I could not even will myself to work,? says Lee in an interview with Dropbox. ?My mind fogged up, it refused to cooperate and the simplest of tasks were difficult. It was at that point I had to finally admit defeat to my team.? In January, 2019, the harsh physical demands of Lee?s lifestyle caught up with her as she burned out in a physical and mental implosion.<br />
<br />
As she lay on her sofa, contemplating the last decade of her life, Lee came to a realization: this is no way to live. The founder?s life?a slog of eternal struggle, stress, and worry?was not for her. When she had recovered from her burn out, Lee decided to walk away from a career she had spent more than a decade building. She now works as a business consultant, helping would be entrepreneurs avoid the mistakes she made as a founder. </p>
<h2>A nation of Sonya Lees</h2>
<p>Lee?s story is far from unique. Employee stress levels have risen <a href="https://www.kornferry.com/institute/motivation-stress-innovation">20 percent</a> in just three decades. More than <a href="https://cdn.wrike.com/ebook/Report_stress_and_productivity.pdf">90 percent</a> of workers experience stress at work and almost a third say their stress is either high or unsustainably high. And skyrocketing stress levels are having a detrimental macroeconomic effects with absenteeism rising and productivity falling.<br />
<br />
With stress levels continuing to rise, many experts are concerned employers are not doing enough to address the underlying structural stressors. But some organizations, supported by new scientific research, are fighting back against workplace stress. By installing innovative policies, processes, and structures, they?re mitigating workplace stress and helping their employees focus on their work.</p>
<h2>What is stress?</h2>
<p>Stress is a much misunderstood biological reaction, according to founder of organizational development consultancy <a href="https://qedod.com/">QED</a>, Dr. Russell Thackeray. ?Stress describes the process of the body using specific hormones to create the energy we need to live our lives,? says Thackeray in an interview with Dropbox. When we experience stress, our hearts beat faster, our breathing quickens, and extra oxygen is sent to the brain. Adrenaline triggers the release of sugar and fats, which pour into our bloodstream to supply energy to systems around our bodies. Our sight, hearing, and alertness all increase, preparing our bodies for the work we?re about to perform. For more substantial energy requirements, our body also produces cortisol, a steroid hormone.<br />
<br />
Thackeray says this process isn?t just healthy, it?s essential for everyday life. ?Healthy stress is called eustress,? says Thackeray. ?It?s used to plan a holiday, chase your kids, and drive your car to the beach.? From an evolutionary perspective, it?s clearly beneficial. When our hunter-gatherer ancestors heard a lion?s roar or an elephant?s trumpet, their bodies needed to kick into action in a split second so they were ready to run away or fight back.<br />
<br />
But, as most of us can attest, stress is certainly not always a good thing. ?Stress becomes disruptive when our requests for energy begin to overwhelm us or when they combine with emotional cues that can trigger the fight-or-flight response,? Thackery explains. ?If we experience too many emotional and workload sources of stress, we begin to experience the challenge of cortisol. As it?s a steroid hormone, the more that is produced, the more it begins to work against us and, in the long term, negatively affect our health.?<br />
<br />
When people become overwhelmed by stress, they can experience a debilitating salvo of cognitive and physical afflictions, including increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, fatigue, burnout, concentration problems, and depression.<br />
<br />
While many people associate serious stress-related conditions with individuals in high-pressure roles, stress affects a wide range of people. And even people who experience mild or moderate stress are very susceptible to stress-induced health and performance problems, especially if they endure over a prolonged period of time.<br />

<h2>A growing problem</h2>
<p>In the last 30 years, employee stress levels have jumped up by 20 percent and a huge portion of the workplace experience stress on a regular basis. And the effect of stress on those individuals is immense. Individuals who regularly experience stress suffer <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579396/">poorer health</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235308682_The_effect_of_stress_and_satisfaction_on_productivity">lower productivity</a>. More than <a href="https://www.kornferry.com/institute/workplace-stress-motivation">three-quarters</a> of people who suffer stress say it has a negative impact on their personal relationships and two-thirds say they have lost sleep.<br />
<br />
These effects generate significant aggregate challenges for organizations. Stressed employees exhibit <a href="https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/insights/2016/02/global-benefit-attitudes-survey-2015-16">60 percent higher absenteeism</a> and are significantly less effective when they?re at work. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/148c/c504c1158828ca1226ad67bcc14e7888f508.pdf">Researchers</a> claim that presenteeism?when employees come to work suffering from conditions that cause them to underperform?can cut an employee?s productivity by up to 77 percent. While employees take, on average, four sick days per year, <a href="https://gccmarketing.blob.core.windows.net/marketing-site/marketo/resources/presenteeism/us-presenteeism-whitepaper.pdf">research</a> suggests that time lost while on the job?by being present but not working productivity?results in a loss of 58 days per employee per year, although we don?t know how much is directly attributable to stress.<br />
<br />
With a mounting pile of research drawing a clear link between stress and productivity, it?s clear that organizations and individuals have to do something?but what?</p>
<h2>Fighting back against stress</h2>
<p>If business leaders are committed to promoting a lower stress environment in their workplace, they need to understand the underlying causes of stress. According to <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-psychology/people/Susan_Michie">Dr. Susan Michie</a>, professor of health psychology at University College London, we can sort workplace stressors into five categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Intrinsic to job</b>: Long hours, work overload, time pressure, difficult tasks, lack of breaks, lack of variety, and poor physical work conditions.</li>
<li><b>Role in organization</b>: Role ambiguity, role conflict, responsibility for people, and conflicts of organization.</li>
<li><b>Career development</b>: Over promotion, under promotion, lack of job security, and thwarted ambition.</li>
<li><b>Relationships at work</b>: Poor interpersonal relationships and difficulty delegating</li>
<li><b>Organizational structure</b>: Diminished participation in decision making, restrictions on behavior, office politics, lack of consultation, and financial difficulties.</li>
</ul>
<p>?Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause,? wrote Michie in her paper Causes and Management of Stress at Work. But Michie goes on to explain that times are changing and the onus is shifting from the individual to the employer. ?Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.?<br />
<br />
Beyond legal incentives, Michie highlights the practical reasons organizations ought to care about stress in the workplace. ?It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction,? wrote Mitchie.<br />
<br />
To learn how organizations are starting to tackle the stress epidemic, we profiled six diverse organizations and the policies, processes, and practices they?re implementing to help mitigate stressors in each of Michie?s five categories.</p>
<h2>Intrinsic to job: Tackling long hours<br />
</h2>
<p>In 1908, a New England spinning mill had a problem. Historically, U.S. businesses had worked six days with a rest on the Sabbath ? which, for most Christian workers, meant they took Sundays off. But the mill?s workforce had a sizable Jewish contingent and they wished to observe Shabbos, Judaism?s day of rest, which falls on Saturday. Instead of forcing Christian workers to come in on Saturday and Jewish workers to come in on Sunday, the mill decided to close entirely over the weekend, creating the five-day working week. The five-day work week quickly became the standard across the whole country.<br />
<br />
For 100 years, we?ve accepted that five days of work and two days of rest was the best split. But people are starting to question whether that?s really the case.<br />
<br />
?A main cause of burnout is work overload, exacerbated by the drudgery of the daily commute to and from work,? explains Jan P. de Jonge, founder of <a href="https://www.peoplebusinesspsychology.com/">People Business Psychology</a>, in an interview with Dropbox. ?To redress the work-life balance, organisations in several countries have successfully decreased the number of hours we work.? As well as improving employees' work-life balance, de Jonge explains that a shorter work week makes people significantly more productive in the office. ?Research suggests that less is more. In some countries, like Germany and The Netherlands, people work less than in the UK, whilst their productivity is higher and their economies stronger.<br />
<br />
In 2005, <a href="https://glennacrooks.com/">Glenna Crooks</a>, founder of Strategic Health Policy International, realized a five-day work week was putting huge pressure on her team. ?Nearly everyone was a working mom and their lives could not be fit into a weekend,? explains Crooks, in an interview with Dropbox. Crooks decided to try something radical: she told her team not to come in on Fridays.<br />
<br />
By reducing her capacity by 20 percent, Crooks says she was prepared to take a financial hit?in fact, she was expecting to take one?but her revenue never dropped. ?I realized that we were knowledge workers working on lots of complex problems and we needed more downtime. By taking an extra day, we could come to work with a clear head.? And that extra relaxation time allowed Crooks? team to increase their productivity enough over the four remaining days to mitigate the time lost on Fridays.<br />
</p>
<h2>Role in organization: Improving role clarity</h2>
<p>Often, job specifications are created months or years in advance of a position being filled. So when a candidate is eventually placed in a role, their responsibilities don?t match up with the contemporary needs of the organization. In other instances, employees have skills and specialities that simply aren?t being utilized in their current role, which can be immensely frustrating.<br />
<br />
In 1981, Swedish psychology scientist Bertil Gardell defined five requirements for a healthy psychosocial work environment. The first requirement is particularly interesting. ?Work should be arranged in a way which allows the individual worker to influence his own working situation, working methods and pace,? wrote Gardell in his paper Work environment research and social change. Gardell?s argument was that people understood their own strengths, weaknesses, and preferences and that made them best placed to design their role.<br />
<br />
Organizations in Scandinavia have been quick to latch onto this idea, allowing employees to participate in the design of his or work own work situation. But outside of Scandinavia, organizations have shown little interest in collaborative role creation. If organizations follow Gardell?s advice, they can craft highly personalized roles and re-engage employees with work that they are passionate about.</p>
<h2>Career development: Providing progression guidance</h2>
<p>In 2014, Australia?s last remaining automaker, Toyota, announced it would end car production in the country. Part of the corporate restructuring plan involved consolidating its national headquarters and moving its entire sales and marketing team from Sydney to Melbourne, 545 miles to the southeast. Job security is a common workplace stressor?but few people ever have to deal with such a seismic shift to their career.<br />
<br />
Toyota?s senior management acknowledged the colossal stress they were putting on their employees and implemented an employee mentoring scheme. The scheme ran between July 2015 and May 2016, placing senior managers with more junior staff members. Initially, the meetings focused on whether the individual should relocate. If mentee decided they would stay in Sydney, the focus switched to helping them prepare for their job search.<br />
<br />
?We were all going through a difficult set of circumstances, and the mentoring program provided a good connection point,? said Naomi Bryant, general manager for Toyota?s retail business solutions, in an interview for <a href="https://artofmentoring.net/case-study-toyota-australia/">Art of Mentoring</a>. ?The program helped participants to make a decision.?<br />
<br />
Beyond qualitative improvements in each employee?s life, there is strong evidence to suggest mentoring schemes significantly benefit the organization itself. In 2006, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/497507/case-study-workforce-analytics-at-sun">Gartner</a> published an in-depth study on Sun Microsystem?s mentoring program. After monitoring 1,000 employees over five years, Gartner discovered that employees in a mentoring scheme were significantly more loyal to an organization?72 percent of mentored employees stayed for five years compared to just 49 percent of those without a mentor.</p>
<h2>Relationships at work: Circumventing hierarchies</h2>
<p>Steve Jobs was a great leader and part of that was getting his employees to stand up to him. An Apple employee <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/careers/what-steve-jobs-taught-me-about-debate-workplace-n732956">recalled</a> an argument he had with Jobs over a small design choice. The employee wanted one option and Jobs demanded another. The disagreement heated up until the two men were shouting at each other. Eventually, the employee relented and allowed Jobs to have his way.<br />
<br />
But a couple of weeks later, it emerged that Jobs had been wrong?and he was furious. Jobs went back to the engineer and yelled at him for conceding the point. Jobs told him that he had hired the engineer because he was great at what he did and it was his job to tell Jobs when he was wrong. As he mused several years later: ?It doesn?t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.?<br />
<br />
In traditional workplace hierarchies, this sort of encounter is fairly common. Lower ranking employees are unwilling to challenge their superiors. And when low ranking employees know things are going wrong, this can cause significant stress, especially if they don?t have Steve Jobs to force them to fight back.<br />
<br />
According to communication expert Kim Scott, one of the most effective ways to circumvent hierarchy challenges is through a skip level meeting. ?The way this works is if you're a manager of managers, once a year you meet with all of the people who work for each of your direct reports,? said Kim, in an <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/kim-scott-interview">interview with Dropbox</a>. So if Kim oversaw three managers ? Anne, James, and Thomas ? she would meet with each of their direct reports and ask how Anne, James, or Thomas could improve their management.<br />
<br />
Because Kim is speaking to people who don?t report directly to her, they are much more likely to be open and honest. Not only do skip level meetings provide a much needed venting opportunity for stressed workers, but they allow senior managers to identify potential fixes.</p>
<h2>Organizational structure: Increasing participation</h2>
<p>In 1980, Alan Parfett founded a new business, a warehouse club called Parfetts. Over the next twenty-eight years, the Parfett family grew their business into a regional powerhouse, with seven depots, four retail shops, and more than 5,000 weekly customers. But, like most retail businesses, Parfetts experienced its share of challenges, chief amongst which was employee engagement.<br />
<br />
Like many workers, Parfetts? employees felt disconnected from the larger corporate entity. They served customers, stacked shelves, and handled the day-to-day operations but they didn?t have any input into the running of the company.<br />
<br />
Everything changed for Parfetts in 2008 when the company embarked on an employee ownership transformation, transferring all of its shares to its current employees. As shareholders, Parfetts? 600 employees receive a dividend twice per year, which draws a clear link between their performance and the commercial success of the business.<br />
<br />
Alongside the ownership change, Parfetts rolled out a number of innovative supporting policies like its elected employee representative. The two representatives sit on the company?s Board of Trustees, providing a way for employees to voice their opinion to senior management.</p>
<p>?One key workplace stressor is the sense of lack of control,? explains de Jonge. ?Employees in part-ownership have more control over their work. Besides this, these employees have more room for their own initiative and discretion. They tend to experience higher levels of health and well-being, as well as support.?</p>
<h2>Building better workplaces</h2>
<p>Stress is an insidious challenge to individuals, teams, and organizations. If left unchecked, it will undermine our effectiveness, alienate us from our work and, in extreme cases, leave us burned out husks. But it doesn?t need to be this way. Scientists like Dr Susan Michie have given us the framework we need to understand the causes of stress and organizations like those we profiled are showing how we can actually tackle those causes.<br />
<br />
However, real progress requires wholesale buy-in from across an organization. It needs individuals to acknowledge the stress they?re experiencing and senior managers to own the structural causes of stress. Once we acknowledge the serious threat stress poses and start implementing policies to reduce or remove key stressors, we can create workplaces that help people work at their very best. </p>

<p>Have you ever gone to a fast food drive-thru and wound up ordering more than you planned? Or doubled the size of your online shopping cart on a whim? What about the time that insurance call went from a simple quote to a home-life-auto discount package?<br />
<br />
When it comes to products and services, bundles are everywhere. But not all such deals are created equal. Some sell you with convenience. Others incentivize impulse buying. Still others coax you into spending money now, rather than later. We took a deep dive into some of the most popular bundles, combos, and multi-product offerings. How exactly do they work, psychologically? How does one bundle differ from another? And which industries use which tactic most often?</p>
<h2>Combining desirable and less desirable products</h2>
<p><i style="font-family: SharpGrotesk , &quot;Open Sans&quot; , sans-serif;font-size: 20.0px;">Typical industries: cable and internet services</i></p>
<p>There?s no bundle more infamous than cable, the expensive television service that gives you hundreds of channels, at least 90% of which you?ll never use. Throw in Wi-Fi coverage and a landline, and you?ve turned an already large bundle of TV stations into a mega-bundle of expensive technology.<br />
<br />
The internet services companies know they?ve got a few products so valuable?reliable internet, live sports?that you?ll tolerate a larger bill and a pile of services you don?t really use. But combining popular and unpopular products comes at a cost: consumers overwhelmingly dislike their cable providers, and they perceive most cable bundles as <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/phone-tv-internet-bundles/people-still-dont-like-their-cable-companies-telecom-survey/">a bad value</a>. Given that most other bundles at least give consumers a superficial satisfaction in getting a deal, the cable bundle stands out for just how unsatisfying it is.<br />
<br />
There are several ways to mitigate this problem?as we?ll see with other types of bundles?whether that involves more consumer choice, limiting the proportion of less desirable products, or shifting the psychological emphasis to other factors.</p>
<h2>Reducing the cognitive load</h2>
<p><i>Typical industry: fast food</i></p>
<p>A good bundle doesn?t necessarily have to be about savings. For fast food, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2012/07/17/its-convenience-not-cost-that-makes-us-fat/#148465a8403a">convenience</a> is often an even bigger sell. If you do the math on the most popular combos at big burger chains today, most offer only marginal savings. Still, ordering your food in a combo gives you less to think about or calculate, with a short list of around eight numbered meals?a simple choice between some traditional favorites and new menu offerings.<br />
<br />
Still, fast food chains have a history of experimenting with bundling strategies beyond convenience. In the 90s, many fast food combos did indeed provide ample savings over a la carte pricing. Over time, however, the power of the big-savings-combo began to fade with consumers.<br />
<br />
More recently, several chains have offered a <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/latest-reports/2016/value-wars-a-new-twist-on-combo-meal-deals/">new twist</a> on combos to increase consumer choice. Instead of choosing between five to 10 pre-made bundles, customers can often pick any four or five items from a ?value? section of the menu. This kind of promotion maintains most of the convenience and simplicity, while also giving consumers a stronger sense of control over their order.</p>
<h2>Using context-based recommendations</h2>
<p><i>Typical industry: retail</i></p>
<p>Sometimes all it takes to create a great bundle is the power of suggestion. Brick-and-mortar shops have been doing this for centuries, with quick-grab items near the register, and special promotional products on aisle end caps next to related goods. But thanks to the power of the web, internet retailers have taken this technique to a whole new level. According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers">a study by McKinsey</a>, 35% of all Amazon purchases come from recommended items?a form of bundling worth tens of billions per quarter.<br />
<br />
Bundling techniques like these have the tremendous advantage of putting control in the hands of the customer?at least psychologically. Even if the shop or website chooses which items to recommend, shoppers curate the final version of their cart. Unlike with cable bundles, these combos create a win-win where the seller makes more money, and the buyer maintains some sense of agency. If there?s any downside for the customer, it?s that they?ll often wind up buying more than they really need.</p>
<h2>Anchoring at a high price point</h2>
<p><i>Typical industries: insurance</i></p>
<p>When you sign up with an insurance company for coverage on a single item?like car insurance?chances are you won?t get an incredible deal. But start adding more coverage across different categories (ex: home, life), and your savings on a per-item basis will increase rapidly.<br />
<br />
The psychological trick here is the original price point. The cost to insure a single vehicle, for example, is typically overpriced. But by the time you?ve added three more items to your plan, the bundled monthly rate feels like a steal.</p>
<p><br />
Here, competition is key. Insurance companies know <a href="http://www.insurancequotes.org/health/when-bundled-insurance-policies-are-a-good-idea/">it?s extremely difficult</a> to get people to switch providers, but if they can get you to switch, you?ll bring a potential lifetime?s worth of money their way. Selling you a big, cost-saving bundle will keep you loyal and make it harder for you to switch back. And unlike with cable or internet, most consumers do have three or more insurance options at a given time?so the bundle deals have to be pretty good. This may contribute to why insurance companies enjoy <a href="https://delighted.com/nps-benchmarks">decent customer satisfaction</a> overall?despite the high starting prices?while TV and internet brands rank at the bottom.</p>
<h2>Increasing consumer choice to incentivize a quicker purchase</h2>
<p><i>Typical industry: electronics</i></p>
<p>In perhaps the most famous <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11148069/derdenger,kumar_dynamicbundling_06_20_13.pdf">bundling study</a> of the 21st century, business professors Timothy Derdenger and Vineet Kumar analyzed Nintendo?s various video game bundling strategies from 2001 to 2005. The study?s conclusion? For game consoles, bundling works well, but only with a ?mixed bundling? strategy. A mixed bundling approach means consumers have the option of purchasing a bundle of products, or purchasing each of those items separately.<br />
<br />
When only selling a la carte, the study found many potential Nintendo customers would hold off on a purchase, assuming a price drop would come eventually. But when Nintendo only sold a bundle, some customers would reject the deal because it included a game or peripheral they didn?t want. With all options on the table, however, the deal seekers found a reason to buy right away, and the less bundle-inclined buyers would still purchase the parts of the combo they wanted.<br />
<br />
This is mostly great for consumers, because they can choose the exact purchase they prefer. There?s not a pressing need to bundle home, auto, and life just to get a decent price, or a requirement to buy 300 channels just to watch the playoffs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nintendo benefitted from selling now rather than later. With both types of customers jumping on their preferred purchase option, Nintendo acquired a larger customer base earlier in the life cycle of the console?which meant more opportunities to sell more games over time. It?s perhaps the best example yet of a bundling system that actually benefits both the company and consumer.</p>
<h2>Emphasizing the ecosystem</h2>
<p><i>Typical industries: software</i></p>
<p>There?s one exception to the mixed bundling advantage: a situation where network effects are strong. In this context, ?network effects? occur when products or features from a single company get better with each incremental user. This is why companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft tend to sell you more on their ecosystems overall than on special discounts or bundling options.<br />
<br />
That said, some people would still prefer to <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/customer-stories/how-dow-jones-stays-nimble">pick and choose their tools</a>. Perhaps you like using an email service from one of these companies, but not its related suite of work tools. Or you enjoy using an iPhone but tend to use Microsoft software on your desktop. The bundling works well for those who go all the way in on one option, but for the more diversified user, the huge emphasis on the ecosystem can be a turn off. Here, <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product-tips/new-dropbox">a mix-and-match approach</a> to software can help.</p>
<h2><br />
Unbundling: The new wave</h2>
<p><i style="font-size: 22.0px;">Typical industry: streaming services</i></p>
<p>Naturally, the biggest antidote to cable?s forced bundles are streaming services, the flag-bearers of the un-bundling movement. Instead of paying more than $100 per month for 300 channels, you can pay about $10 to $20 per month for a certain subset of content.</p>
<p>For the right customer, streaming services provide an irresistible alternative to the giant cable offerings of the last few decades. If you mostly want award-winning TV dramas, a small selection of popular films, and periodic comedy specials, services like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO will give you exactly what you want at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Still, a few problems linger. Most live content?like news and sports?doesn?t fit naturally on streaming services. Many popular shows only appear on a single service. And the archive of classic shows and movies on each platform can change weekly based on the latest contract terms.</p>
<p>But perhaps more problematic than all that is the great re-bundling?the fact that many of these streaming services are essentially recreating their own bundles. Want a family plan? Just pay a bit more. How about a DVD-by-mail supplementary service? Have you considered an even higher service tier with fewer ads?</p>
<p>So the streaming world both gives and takes from customers. Letting consumers pick from several low-cost, supplementary options is a great step in the right direction. But recreating a new walled garden after breaking down cable?s fortress could lead to some cable-like problems down the road.</p>
<h2><br />
Respecting the customer</h2>
<p>Each industry uses its respective bundling strategy for one big reason: it works. But the best bundles do more than simply increase sales; they respect the customer. For the bundle makers, emphasizing convenience, cost-savings, or a great ecosystem is a good start?it?s better than forcing consumers to knowingly buy services they don?t need. Even better, however, is giving customers more choice: a chance to assemble their own bundle, or pick and choose which items to buy a la carte. That?s when bundles evolve from a smart psychological offer to a truly great deal.</p>

<p>Media teams are among the most active Dropbox users in the world, creating and saving <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/media-entertainment-partnerships" target="_blank">more than a billion files</a> in 2017 alone. With the rise of HD, 4K and 8K video, online social video services, and podcasting, the need for faster, more efficient video and audio production workflows grows every year. </p>
<p>That?s why we?re continually talking with our customers in advertising, broadcasting, marketing, publishing, and social media to better understand the ways they work, what they need, and how Dropbox can help. </p>
<p>To continue supporting our customers? needs, we developed new integrations with your favorite video, audio, and transcription tools. By allowing you to access Dropbox files without having to leave the application interface, these integrations help you save time, stay on the same page with your team, and finish projects faster.</p>
<h2>Shoot, sync, cut, share</h2>
<p>Dropbox is integrated natively into the <b><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" target="_blank">Adobe Premiere Rush</a> </b>tool, so you can speed up your editing and post it to your social channels faster, whether you?re working on mobile, tablet, or desktop. </p>
<p>After you shoot your content and upload it to Dropbox, your team can access and preview the clips on any device using Dropbox, and pull them into Premiere Rush. Within Rush?s media browser, you can import your audio and video content from Dropbox. Then you can either export and sync back to Dropbox or publish directly to YouTube, Instagram, or Facebook. </p>

<p>&quot;We're constantly looking for ways to give creatives everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences,&quot; said Sue Skidmore, head of partner relations for Adobe Video. &quot;Our collaboration with Dropbox can enable our users to stay creative no matter where they are by making it possible for them to seamlessly shoot, edit and share their content online.?</p>
<h2>Get transcriptions in real time</h2>
<p>Typing out transcripts takes too much time. And it?s exactly the kind of ?work about work? Dropbox wants to help reduce. Creative teams need to be able to upload an interview, video footage, or a recording of a meeting, and have it transcribed automatically. To help them stay focused on storytelling, we?re working on ways to automate the tedious tasks and boring chores. </p>
<p>We worked with <a href="https://blog.otter.ai/otter-dropbox-integration/" target="_blank"><b>Otter.ai </b></a>to develop an<b> </b>integration that simplifies your workflows and provides meeting recording and transcription, including speaker identification. </p>
<p>When you connect Otter Voice Meeting Notes to Dropbox, any time you drop a video or audio file into the Otter app folder, it will be automatically transcribed and you will be alerted as soon as your transcription is ready. </p>
<p>When you record or process an audio file in Otter for Teams Voice Meeting Notes, it automatically transcribes the conversation, detects speakers, and generates summary keywords with AI. Decisions made in the team meeting are instantly searchable, shareable with the team, and exportable to Dropbox as soon as the meeting is over.</p>

<h2>Bring the transcript to your video editing</h2>
<p>Production teams told us they could save valuable time if they could simply select audio or video files, interview and raw footage, and dailies stored in Dropbox, and quickly transcribe them to begin their video edit. We partnered with <a href="https://simonsays.ai/"><b>Simon Says</b></a> to make it happen. The integration is built for industry standard audio and video editors, including Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition. </p>
<p>With Simon Says, you can transcribe your media files in 100 languages, bookmark and annotate the transcript, then export the XML directly to your editing timeline. When you?ve completed your edit, you can add captions and translate the subtitles.</p>

<p>As humans took our first steps on the moon, our perspective as a species changed. Perhaps just as amazingly, we were all doing the exact same thing at the exact same time?glued to our television or radio sets.</p>
<p>It?s moments like these that make space exploration so enthralling. Since 1969 there have been countless groundbreaking discoveries. But can you remember how or when you learned of recent events from space? Even though our means for mass, real-time communication have undoubtedly improved in the last 50 years, somehow these moments have felt more disjointed and less exciting.</p>
<p><a href="https://supercluster.netlify.com/">Supercluster</a> is trying to change that. It?s a storytelling platform?brought to life by creative agency <a href="http://grandarmy.com/">GrandArmy</a>, film and television studio <a href="https://a24films.com/">A24</a>, and a network of journalists, designers, artists, and engineers?serving as a creative, engaging, and credible hub for all things space.</p>
<p>?Our mission is simple: Inspire wonder, awe, and adventure, through the telling of humanity?s greatest story. Supercluster is your best friend in outer space,? says Supercluster Chief of Content, Robin Seemangal.</p>
<p>The team stitches all this content together by collaborating in Dropbox. Supercluster?s cadre of space enthusiasts is spread all around the world (it?s still within Earth, right, no big deal), needing to move articles, podcasts, and videos from initial research to final placement on the site. </p>

<p>Don?t worry, we?re right there with you?and precisely why we built file recovery and version history into Dropbox. </p>
<p>But, what can you do when a catastrophic event happens? Let?s say an application crashes in the middle of a project and erases all of your latest work. Or even worse, you?re targeted by ransomware and locked out of your files. Fixing devastating mishaps isn?t always as simple as reversing an edit or recovering a lost file.</p>
<p>Now there?s no need to fret about big accidents because Dropbox has your back. We?ve built Dropbox Rewind?a new feature that can take your account back in time before disaster struck and makes Dropbox a safer place to keep everything that?s important to you. <br />

            In early 2017, Shelly Schneider accepted a new job at a large insurance company. With a desk surrounded by hundreds of coworkers, she expected to have a robust social experience at work.

<p>But after two years, Schneider found herself isolated, unhappy, and unproductive.</p>
<p>Schneider excelled in her role as an underwriter, working across all of the company?s service lines and receiving consistently positive feedback from her director. But her role required very little contact with her colleagues, and she found herself falling out of touch with her office neighbors and team members.</p>
<p>?There were many days when no one would even speak to me unless I left my cubicle to talk to someone,? explains Schneider. On the rare occasions when she did try to speak to her colleagues, she was reprimanded by her line manager for wasting company time. Her workplace social life quickly devolved into a series of empty greetings and meaningless small talk. Each day, Schneider would sit at her desk, surrounded by a sea of strangers, alone and frustrated.</p>
<p>After two years, the loneliness grew too much to bear. ?I realized that no one really cared as long as I achieved the goals asked of me. It made me feel like I was wasting my time.? One Tuesday morning in the fall of 2018, Schneider quit. As she walked out of the office on her final day, carrying a small box of personal effects, no one asked where she was going, no one told her they?d miss her, and no one hugged her goodbye.</p>
<p>Schneider guesses that many of her former colleagues were experiencing similar issues. Walking out of the building on her final day, Schneider says she felt sorry for the people who had to return to their desks the next day. And she was right to worry. Loneliness at work is a huge issue across the world. According to the <a href="https://www.ey.com/us/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-ey-explores-belonging-in-the-workplace-with-new-belonging-barometer-study">EY Belonging Barometer</a>, 40 percent of employees feel isolated in their role, driving higher disengagement and lower productivity. </p>

<h2>What is workplace loneliness?</h2>
<p>?Loneliness is the feeling of being alone, left out, and isolated, regardless of how many people are around you,? explains Jenny Maenpaa, a psychotherapist specializing in professional and organizational development. ?It?s only alleviated by fostering meaningful human connection with one another, so our artificial transactions of polite chit chat with a colleague, barista, or fellow commuter don?t count.? </p>
<p>Maenpaa says loneliness is a growing problem in our society, especially in our workplaces. ?As an average single urban-dwelling adult, we walk to the subway with our headphones in, order coffee on an app, enter our offices with a keycard, and sit down at our computers to email and message our colleagues sitting just feet away,? says Maenpaa. ?We eat lunch at our desks or in a corner of the lunchroom glued to social media, and when the day is over, we walk back out with our headphones in and ride the subway home again to order delivery from an app. And we do it day after day.?</p>
<p>As Schneider discovered in her role, merely being surrounded by people doesn?t alleviate loneliness. Maenpaa explains that people often feel loneliest at work, in public, or at parties. If we don?t have genuine personal connections with those people surrounding us, they are really just strangers whose professional or social circles overlap with ours.</p>
<p>Maenpaa also highlights a lesser known dimension of loneliness: people also suffer from loneliness when they are not <i>heard </i>or <i>understood</i>. In roles like this, it feels like you are working for the sake of working, which undermines your very purpose. According to Maenpaa, silos like these are increasingly common, leaving a growing portion of our workforce cut off from their colleagues.</p>
<h2>What does loneliness cost?</h2>
<p>The effects of loneliness are damaging for both the individual and the company. Lonely workers are significantly <a href="https://www.ahsw.org.uk/userfiles/Research/Perspectives%20on%20Psychological%20Science-2015-Holt-Lunstad-227-37.pdf"><u>more unhealthy</u></a> than their connected colleagues, exhibiting increased risks of cardiovascular disease and depression and compromised immunity. Lonely workers also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25222636"><u>perform worse in their roles</u></a>, exhibiting impaired creativity, productivity, and decision making.</p>

<p>Of course, this has an effect on the performance of organizations as a whole. Without strong interpersonal relationships, people quickly dehumanize each other, which inevitably leads to abrasive team dynamics. Research from the <a href="https://smith.queensu.ca/magazine/issues/winter-2014"><u>Smith School of Business at Queen?s University</u></a> and the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/services/178514/state-american-workplace.aspx"><u>Gallup Organization</u></a> suggests that companies with high disengagement and loneliness experience almost 37 percent higher absenteeism, 49 percent more accidents, and 16 percent lower profitability.</p>
<p>As former United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy summarized in <a href="https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic"><u>Harvard Business Review</u></a>, ?Our understanding of biology, psychology, and the workplace calls for companies to make fostering social connections a strategic priority.?</p>
<h2>Why are we lonely?</h2>
<p>Before we can tackle loneliness, we need to understand what causes it. But loneliness is a complex emotional response, and any specific occurrence is likely caused by a multitude of different structural and cultural drivers.</p>
<p>?New communication technologies like email and instant messaging are reducing face-to-face meeting time,? explains health researcher Bart Wolbers, and these technologies ?cannot replace real social connections.? While modern communication strategies are functional, Wolbers explains that they strip us of the in-person social interactions we need to feel a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Related to this is the growth in flexible working conditions. ?During the last few decades, companies have increasingly adopted more flexible work environments, which means you're no longer spending your work days with colleagues you see every day,? said Wolbers. Sometimes, that means working unusual hours when no one else is in the office. Other times, it means working in a physically isolated location away from your colleagues. Ultimately, it means less in-person contact.&quot;</p>
<p>Beverly Friedmann, for example, works as a content manager for a consumer website. She has a great team with a personable line manager, whom she speaks to on a daily basis. Despite this, she admits the long hours spent writing on her own can be tough. After eight hours with only her keyboard for company, Friedmann says feelings of loneliness can start to creep in. Considering the rapid rise in remote working?<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321868"><u>IWG</u></a> discovered that 70 percent of professionals now work remotely at least one day a week?millions more people are dealing with similar feelings each year.</p>
<p>While it?s right to highlight the drawbacks of modern working practices, it?s also important to recognize the benefits they offer. Friedmann, for example, works remotely for a company based far away from her home. Without the option of remote work, she simply would not have had that opportunity.</p>

<p>Then there's the growth in non-participatory jobs. ?More and more jobs today don't require any face-to-face interactions,? says Wolbers. ?The entire Information Technology sector barely existed 30 years ago. Now, it employs millions of people who don't have to communicate frequently to get their daily tasks done.?</p>
<p>Finally, Wolbers highlights underlying economic changes. ?Most lower- and middle-class people have to work much harder to make ends meet,? says Wolbers. ?Labor compensation as a percentage of the total economy has gone down and workplaces are getting streamlined, leading to a society in which every five minutes count.? Wolbers explains that this economic squeeze usually decreases the amount of time people are granted to socialize within the workplace. Shelly Schneider experienced this firsthand when her employers pushed her to maximize the time at her desk to the detriment of informal conversations with her colleagues.</p>
<p>Wolbers admits that these drivers are both significant and deeply-ingrained?but he remains optimistic. He believes that with careful intervention from senior staff, most organizations can reduce loneliness and begin fostering genuine connections among their employees once more.</p>
<h2>Building a better workplace</h2>
<p>While some companies have scrambled to address loneliness with lavish parties, dinners, off-sites, volunteer trips, and so on, there are also simple, everyday changes that can have just as profound an effect.</p>
<p><b>Default to in-person communication</b></p>
<p>According to communication expert Kim Scott, many people opt for digital communication tools like email or text, believing that they?re more efficient than an in-person conversation. But usually, they?re wrong.</p>
<p>?Around 80 to 90 percent of communication is nonverbal,? said Scott, during an interview with <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/kim-scott-interview"><u>Dropbox</u></a>. By communicating via email, instant message, or phone, you lose that meaning, which can lead to misunderstandings and confusion. And worse, these communication methods poorly mimic real in-person conversations and fail to provide the social experiences we need to thrive.</p>
<p>Scott explains that there is a hierarchy of communication mediums. ?A video call is better than a phone call. Video is better than just audio. A phone call is way better than an email.? But wherever possible, Scott recommends you default to in-person communication. It?s faster, clearer, and strengthens the personal connection among staff members.</p>
<p><b>Encourage Mentorship</b></p>
<p>In June, 2011, Alex Burbidge moved hundreds of miles across the UK <a href="https://www.bigsmiles.co/news/how-to-cope-with-loneliness-and-why-we-have-no-office-friends/"><u>to start a new job</u></a> in the engineering industry. As a young graduate, the unknowns of the situation fanned the flames of doubt in his mind, burning away the excitement he once felt. On his first morning, Burbidge?s line manager showed him to his desk, briefed him on his work, and left him to it. After four weeks, Burbidge was coping with the role but felt very much like an outsider?and it would stay that way for the rest of his one-year contract.</p>
<p>According to CEO of MyCorporation, Deborah Sweeney, Burbidge?s onboarding experience?or more precisely, his complete lack of an onboarding experience?is surprisingly common. Many line managers thrust new hires into roles and expect them to immediately perform at the level of a seasoned employee. This, Sweeney says, leads to employees panicking and withdrawing from their colleagues and the organization.</p>
<p>Sweeney, however, has implemented a simple change to her onboarding process to help engage new hires with their colleagues and the organization. ?We help employees integrate into our organization by assigning them a mentor,? explains Sweeney. ?Our mentors not only help employees better develop their skill sets and ease into their role, but they also develop personal relationships with mentees.?</p>
<p>As Anthony Tjan, founder of venture capital firm Cue Ball, <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/02/what-the-best-mentors-do">explained in Harvard Business Review</a>: ?At its highest level, mentorship is about being ?good people? and having the right ?good people? around us ? individuals committed to helping others become fuller versions of who they are.?</p>
<p>By surrounding new staff members with outstanding people, Sweeney believes she shows that her organization genuinely cares about its employees. And that type of environment can help employees feel less lonely.</p>
<p>While mentoring is most prevalent in workplaces with formal schemes, the onus is not solely on the employer. Individuals should seek out informal mentoring relationships or recommend more formal mentoring schemes to their line manager.</p>
<p><b>Bake in social time</b></p>
<p>When Ollie Smith was building his startup team, he decided to recruit from all across the world. That way, he could pull from the widest talent pool and push ahead of his geographically-limited competitors.</p>
<p>But last year, Smith noticed some of his staff were starting to act strangely. They were more disconnected from their work and seemed more abrasive in their interactions. He decided to run an all-team video call to discuss the problem. Many of his team members identified the same issue: after a year at the startup, it still felt like they were working with strangers.</p>
<p>It was suddenly so obvious to Smith. His team spent eight hours a day working together but they were never really <i>together</i>. They never had time to socialize and get to know each other as actual people beyond their profile pictures and email addresses.</p>
<p>Smith?s solution was to manufacture relaxed social time. Each Thursday afternoon, Smith?s team members log on to a video call and simply hang out?something he dubbed Team Thursday. While they?ll often play simple games, much of their time is spent chatting and getting to know each other on a personal level.</p>
<p>Smith admits that Team Thursday might seem like a waste of time?after all, his staff members are purposefully <i>not</i> working?but he believes the benefits are worth it. And he believes all teams could benefit: ?Although my team is geographically distributed, I would encourage all organizations to manufacture some level of social time, even if it?s 10 or 20 minutes per week. You would be amazed at the bonds that form when people are allowed to just enjoy each other?s company.</p>
<p><b>Build effective social spaces</b></p>
<p>When Steve Jobs designed Pixar?s headquarters, he structured the building around a central atrium. Jobs envisioned the atrium as a melting pot for Pixar?s diverse staff of artists, writers, and computer scientists. By encouraging spontaneous meetings between staff members, the space would lead employees to find acquaintances, develop friendships, and spread ideas.</p>
<p>?At first, I thought this was the most ridiculous idea,? said Pixar producer Darla Anderson, during an interview with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/groupthink"><u>The New Yorker</u></a>. But, after experiencing the melting pot atrium firsthand, Anderson realized that Jobs was right. ?I get more done having a cup of coffee and striking up a conversation or walking to the bathroom and running into unexpected people than I do sitting at my desk.?</p>
<p>Few organizations have the budget to redesign the architecture of their workspace, but that doesn?t mean they should ignore their social spaces entirely. ?To cultivate more social interactions employers should create social gathering places at work, such as break rooms with lots of food options, seating options, music and so on,? explains psychologist Wyatt Fisher. ?The more inviting the space the more likely it will be used.?</p>
<p><b>Share your successes</b><br />
</p>
<p>With technological, economic, and cultural factors cutting off connections between staff members, it?s easy for their work to become siloed and insulated. A graphic designer, for example, may produce a beautiful illustration yet never see how it slots into a larger marketing campaign. According to entrepreneur Sandeep Kumar Aggarwal, this can lead to employees feeling disengaged from their organization and isolated from their colleagues.</p>
<p>?We all have the same desire for meaningful work, belonging, social connection, ownership, and purpose,? says Aggarwal. ?These reasons fuel pride and connection to the workplace and motivate us to strive for personal excellence.? To highlight meaningful work in his team, Aggarwal uses something called a Crush it Call.</p>
<p>?During our Crush it Calls, every employee calls out a particular coworker for crushing it,? explained Aggarwal. ?This is a chance for coworkers to show appreciation through recognition and engage an individual with the team.? After introducing Crush it Calls, Aggarwal says his employees are happier, less burned out, and more willing to experiment with new ideas.</p>
<p>Maenpaa believes there?s a strong psychological explanation for this. ?Shouting out another person?s wins is a great strategy for combating impostor syndrome and fostering meaningful connections,? explains Maenpaa. ?When we highlight another person?s accomplishments, we?re saying, ?I see you, I respect you, and I want everyone else to hear my endorsement of your work.??</p>
<h2>Reconnecting people</h2>
<p>As New York University sociologist Eric Klinenberg writes in his book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/305485/going-solo-by-eric-klinenberg/9780143122777/"><i><u>Going Solo</u></i></a>: ?It?s the quality, not the quantity of social interaction that best predicts loneliness.? As we?ve seen, a handful of organizations are already starting to implement innovative processes and policies to improve the quality of their teams' interactions and reconnect people with their colleagues.</p>
<p>After leaving her role, Shelly Schneider went on to work in a number of businesses that did tackle loneliness. Schneider explains that in her experience, a workplace?s treatment of loneliness depends on the company culture and ownership of the problem at the very top. If an organization doesn?t have someone driving progress, it?s likely staff members will end up like she did: alone, isolated, and disengaged.</p>
<p>To drive real change and effectively combat loneliness, Schneider believes we need founders, business owners, managers, and HR teams around the world to own the problem of loneliness and implement effective employee engagement solutions. Once we do that, we can push back against the harmful effects of loneliness and reconnect people with each other.</p>

<p>When you think of a bad day at work in Australia, your mind might wander to someone wrestling crocodiles in the outback or waiting for wombats to cross the road on their commute. But what is working life really like down under? And how can they have ?no worries? when they deal with the same workday grind as everyone else?</p>
<p>In our series on ?The Working World,? we?re looking at how different cultures cope with the challenges of modern work, and how countries are adapting to address the problems. In <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/the-working-world--will-new-laws-improve-work-culture-in-japan-" target="_blank">part one</a>, we explored how work style reform laws are impacting workers in Japan. In <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/france-right-to-disconnect-law" target="_blank">part two</a>, we discussed whether the El Khomri law was actually helping French workers ?disconnect? after office hours. In <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/germany-perfectionism-versus-productivity" target="_blank">part three</a>, we learned why German workers feel pulled between perfection and productivity.</p>
<p>Here in part four, we?ll look at how Australian work culture is evolving as the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/economy/asia-pacific/australia-economic-outlook.html" target="_blank">mining boom ends and the housing market slows</a>, while knowledge workers are poised to take <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/knowledge-workers,-skills-of-the-heart-the-jobs-of-the-future/11201254" target="_blank">6 out of 7 jobs</a> created in the next decade. </p>
<p>To get some perspectives from Australia and learn how workers are preparing for the changes to come, we spoke with Le Tran, our Head of Communications for Asia Pacific &amp; Japan, and Jennifer Norrie, our Campaigns and Content Lead for APAC, both from the Dropbox office in Sydney. </p>

<h2>?We?re a lucky country?</h2>
<p>Australians are famous for being<a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170607-why-are-australians-so-laid-back" target="_blank"> laid back</a>. And the ?no worries, mate? approach to life goes way beyond beach culture. Economically, they?ve had a seemingly easy stretch of success with no recession for over <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2017/08/10/the-rising-success-of-startups-down-under-inside-australias-entrepreneurial-ecosystem/#1e21a7911cda" target="_blank">25 years</a>. Le says that good fortune is largely due to two factors.</p>
<p>?We?re a resource-rich country. The mining boom created unprecedented growth for the economy,? she says. <b><i>?</i></b>Geographically, we?re close to China, so we?ve been lucky to have China as an exporting partner, especially during the massive growth they?ve had over the past two decades.?</p>
<p>Le says job security and workers? rights add to the sense of confidence and optimism. ?We have a history of very strong union activism, which means there?s a lot of protection for Australian workers.?</p>
<p>Though they?re known for their strong work ethic, Australians manage to leave job stress at the office. ?Maybe it?s our geographical isolation or our inconvenient timezone or our anti-competitive ?fair go? ethos, but Australians generally make work fit into our lives versus making our lives fit into our work,? says Le. ?Obviously, I?m not speaking for everyone in Australia, but there is a sense of life/work harmony here.&quot;</p>

<h2>When ?no worries? becomes a worry</h2>
<p>?The flip side of ?No worries, mate? and ?It?ll be right in the morning? is complacency,? says Le. </p>
<p>?There?s a pervasive mentality that says, ?Nobody is better than me, and I am better than nobody,? which is all very noble,? says Jennifer Norrie. ?But the flip side of this is ?Tall Poppy Syndrome.? We put a name to it in Australia, but I think it?s something that?s present all over the world. It essentially means that it?s expected that you should maintain a degree of humility about your success. It?s important to be humble. If you grow ?too tall,? you?ll be cut down.?</p>
<p>Now some wonder whether ?tall poppy syndrome? might be holding Australians back?right when entrepreneurial leadership is needed most. </p>
<p>?The mining boom is over and demand from China is also slowing,? says Le. ?We?ve realized the future of the economy is not going to come from the digging things from ground and selling them to China; we have to shift towards a knowledge-based economy.?</p>
<p>But unlike the intensity of Silicon Valley, and for all the reasons mentioned above, Australia has traditionally been a culture that?s less focused on constant innovation.</p>
<p>?This is where Australia and America differ. That individual drive to achieve the American dream? the idea that you can start from nothing and achieve so much all on your own, isn?t so ingrained in the Australian psyche. The Australian dream is to buy your own home and have a portfolio of investment properties so that you can have a comfortable retirement.?</p>
<p>The erosion of the Australian dream?or rather the unattainability of it?hit an all time high when Bernard Salt, a demographer, KPMG advisor, and columnist at The Australian, suggested that that &quot;<a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/weekend-australian-magazine/moralisers-we-need-you/news-story/6bdb24f77572be68330bd306c14ee8a3" target="_blank">smashed avo</a>&quot; (avocado on toast) was the reason why millennials could not afford to buy their own homes. This sparked a national and generational debate and has become a meme to define an entire generation?s inability to realize the great Australian dream.</p>

<h2>The rise of entrepreneurism</h2>
<p>Longstanding cultural attitudes aren?t the only obstacle. When your country?s economy has been fueled by abundant resources for almost 200 years, adjusting to a new reality is a monumental change. But in recent years, Le says, there?s been a strong national narrative and urgency around transitioning from a resource-dependent economy to a knowledge economy.</p>
<p>What?s really put fire into the whole conversation around entrepreneurism is the rise of successful tech companies, the most well known being Atlassian. Atlassian has become symbolic of what an Australian knowledge-based or innovation-based company can be ? says Le. ?Suddenly, we?ve realized that Australia can produce multi-billion dollar companies that are not mining or property related. In fact, this year?s <a href="https://www.afr.com/rich-list" target="_blank">RICH LIST</a> includes more tech entrepreneurs than ever before.?</p>
<p>?There is recognition that as a nation, we need to have foresight and invest in innovation,? says Le. ?For a long time Australia, like many other economies, looked towards Silicon Valley for inspiration. We wanted to bottle some of that energy and some of that risk taking and entrepreneurism and enrich Australia with that. But?here?s the catch: we also want to do it the Australian way.?</p>
<h2>Leading the way or catching up?</h2>
<p>Herein lies the emerging tension for the future of life and work in Australia. At the same time that there?s a push to move towards a dynamic, fast moving innovation economy, there?s also a pull to maintain the unique work culture that Australians have managed to create.</p>
<p>The question is: Should the world learn to relax, give things a ?fair go? and follow the Australian way or should Australia catch up with the rest of the world? </p>
<p>Judging from what we?ve heard from our colleagues in <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/the-working-world--will-new-laws-improve-work-culture-in-japan-" target="_blank">Japan</a>, <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/france-right-to-disconnect-law" target="_blank">France</a>, and <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/germany-perfectionism-versus-productivity" target="_blank">Germany</a>, burnout has become pervasive enough to spark changes in work culture in different countries around the world. At a time when tech addiction feels like an unwelcome export, maybe importing a ?no worries? work culture could bring back some balance.</p>

            Delivering large files or collections of files to colleagues and clients is a challenge. While sharing through Dropbox is great for collaboration, sometimes you want to just hand off files without having to worry about permissions, ongoing access, and storage.

<p>And then there?s email: handing off files is easy, but attachments have size limits, and it?s not clear when your recipient has viewed them. That?s why we?re so excited to introduce Dropbox Transfer, a quick, secure way to send large files to anyone.</p>
<h2>Easily deliver any file</h2>
<p>Transfer offers the convenience of email, without the 25 MB limit on attachments. With Transfer, you can send up to 100 GB of files?five times what some other services allow?in just a few clicks. You?ll have the option to drag and drop files to upload from your computer, or skip the wait by adding items stored in Dropbox. Once you've created your transfer, you?ll get a link that can be pasted anywhere. You can send the link to anyone, even if they don?t have a Dropbox account, or send an automatically generated email right from Transfer. Recipients will receive copies of the files, so your originals will remain untouched. </p>

<h2>Ensure your files get delivered</h2>
<p>You?ll also be able to customize your transfers with tools to help you control access and encourage downloads. You can add, edit, or remove a password, or set?and change?an expiration date, even after you send the link. Plus, download notifications let you ensure your files have been received. You can even see how many times your link is accessed with viewership stats.</p>
