</ol>
<p>Ready, gentlemen? Let's get into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tool1"></a></p>
<h2>1. My Smartphone</h2>
<p>This first men's everyday carry tool I've got to mention is something I seldom see people without.</p>
<p>Since their introduction in their early 2000s, smartphones have taken the world by storm as a truly universal tool. You'd be hard-pressed to find anybody without one, regardless of income or age.</p>
<div id="attachment_92461" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/cell-phone-etiquette/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92461" class="wp-image-92461 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/phone-call-1.jpeg" alt="cool short words phone call" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/phone-call-1.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/phone-call-1-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/phone-call-1-450x225.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-92461" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/cell-phone-etiquette/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here for some tips on cell phone etiquette.</a></p></div>
<p>What makes mine even more convenient is what I added to it.</p>
<p>I use a Rhino cover and, more importantly, a wallet attached to the back.</p>
<p>It holds everything I need; from my credit cards to my personal ID. The slim profile allows it to slip right into my front pocket with ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tool2"></a></p>
<h2>2. Men's Watches</h2>
<p>Gentlemen, you've heard me go on about the importance of watches, but it just can't be overstated.</p>
<p>Watches are about as timeless as it gets.</p>
<p>From the first line of pocket watches in 1524 to the advent of wristwatches in the early 20th century, they've remained a key indicator of a man who is conscious of his look.</p>
<p>A wristwatch is also the perfect way to express your personal style, even in formal settings. There are so many variations that the possibilities are practically endless.</p>
<p>The watches that I have worn all through this summer have all been dive watches. Why? They were originally built for braving the seas, and their nautical heritage is appropriate for the season.</p>
<div id="attachment_93576" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/watch-styles-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93576" class="wp-image-93576 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watch-types-2019-01.jpg" alt="men's dive watch" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watch-types-2019-01.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watch-types-2019-01-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watch-types-2019-01-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/watch-types-2019-01-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-93576" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/watch-styles-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My everyday carry for the summer includes a Dive Watch. Want to learn more? Click here to check out the ultimate guide to watch styles.</a></p></div>
<p>The bottom line is this &#8211; a man might be wearing shorts, sneakers and a T-shirt but if he's wearing a stylish men's wristwatch, then you can bet he cares about how he looks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tool3"></a></p>
<h2>3. My Keys</h2>
<p>As far as everyday carry essentials for men go, the house and car keys are essential. If you're not taking your keys with you, it's a wonder you get around!</p>
<p>It's a safe bet that most, if not all men carry their house and car keys, but whatever else they add to the set is up to them.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Keys to your house and car are critical everyday carry items for every man.</em></h4>
<p>So, what's on my keyring?</p>
<p>Besides my truck and house keys, I have my office key on hand. I keep my P.O. Box and Gym keys handy. I also make sure to have my YMCA  and gym cards attached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tool4"></a></p>
<h2>4. A Quality Gym Bag</h2>
<p>I try to hit the gym about 5 times a week, so my gym bag comes with me.</p>
<p>Since it's carrying my exercise essentials, it can't be a dainty bag. For that reason, I've opted for a quality full-grain leather bag.</p>
<div id="attachment_95577" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://bit.ly/2YezeKp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95577" class="wp-image-95577 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle.jpg" alt="mahi duffle bag" width="700" height="587" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle-300x252.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle-298x250.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95577" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://bit.ly/2YezeKp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out the MAHI duffle bag &#8211; perfect for the gym!</a></p></div>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to invest in a bag like this.</p>
<p>Not least of which is the durability you'll be receiving.</p>
<p>It might sting your wallet at first, but a bag that'll last you at least 50 years will save you loads of money in the long run.  Just like a watch<span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> it's a timeless item that you can pass down to your kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tool5"></a></p>
<h2>5. Bluetooth Headset</h2>
<p>As far as everyday carry essentials for men, you'd think that a guy like me is using a Bluetooth headset because I'm constantly making calls.</p>
<p>You'd be wrong!</p>
<div id="attachment_96486" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96486" class="wp-image-96486 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/using-earbuds.jpg" alt="man wearing earbuds in train" width="748" height="415" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/using-earbuds.jpg 748w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/using-earbuds-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/using-earbuds-450x250.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96486" class="wp-caption-text">I find any excuse to listen to one of my audiobooks.</p></div>
<p>In fact, I only use my headset to listen to audiobooks &#8211; whether I'm lounging around or grocery shopping.</p>
<p>I'm always trying to learn, and audiobooks have grown to be a consistent source of inspiration. I strongly recommend that everyone develop a routine around them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tool6"></a></p>
<h2>6. Some Stylish Shades</h2>
<p>Recently, I've been wearing Enemy Eyewear &#8211; a new company whose shades I've been having fun with.</p>
<p>The right pair of shades can do wonders for a man's look and there are several styles embraced by numerous brands around the world.</p>
<p>Do you admire military heritage? Aviators might be for you.</p>
<p>Are you more for suave style? Clubmasters may do your outfit justice.</p>
<p>The best part is that even those broad categories come in a myriad of expressions, and you really can't go wrong.</p>
<div id="attachment_72458" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72458" class="wp-image-72458 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/pexels-photo-46710-e1541471083821.jpeg" alt="sunglasses on beach in sunset" width="700" height="467" /><p id="caption-attachment-72458" class="wp-caption-text">Never underestimate the power of a quality pair of shades.</p></div>
<p>It's why I highly recommend this men's everyday carry piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tool7"></a></p>
<h2>7. A Tactical Pen</h2>
<p>Some of us carry pens, but who among you carries a TACTICAL pen?</p>
<p>This tool &#8211; also known as an EDC pen, is an often forgotten piece of everyday equipment with considerable utility.</p>
<p>It could also save your life.</p>
<p>Unlike your everyday writing utensil, EDC pens are often built with a titanium shell along with a pressurized ink cartridge. They come with a host of tools ranging from a puncher to break car windows in an emergency, to a blade for self-defense.</p>
<div id="attachment_96490" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96490" class="wp-image-96490 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tactical-pen.jpg" alt="tactical pen" width="700" height="420" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tactical-pen.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tactical-pen-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tactical-pen-417x250.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96490" class="wp-caption-text">My EDC pen reminds me of my time in the US Marine Corps, which helps me to focus and strive for more.</p></div>
<p>I lean toward Gerber as my go-to brand. Their pens stand out as being designed under the advice of law enforcement officials, so I prefer what the pros go after.</p>
<p>Gerbers are able to write in all weather conditions. They also feature a steel-tipped window puncher to deliver maximum strength, as well as a machined steel build.</p>
<p>What could inspire more fear in a wrongdoer than being impaled with a hunk of titanium?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary &#8211; Men's Everyday Carry</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="#tool1">My Smartphone</a></li>
<li><a href="#tool2">Men's Watches</a></li>
<li><a href="#tool3">My Keys</a></li>
<li><a href="#tool4">A Quality Gym Bag</a></li>
<li><a href="#tool5">Bluetooth Headphones</a></li>
<li><a href="#tool6">Sunglasses</a></li>
<li><a href="#tool7">A Tactical Pen</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Are you wrong if you don't use the same tools? Absolutely not. Every man has his own arsenal at his disposal. This was merely a glimpse into my favorite tools that I use to dominate each and every day.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Should you or should you not wake up early on the weekend?</p>
<p>If you think about it, most people wake up early on weekdays and they are totally fine.</p>
<p>Why should the weekends be any different?</p>

<p>In this article, I will show you 5 benefits that come from waking up early on the weekend.</p>
<p>Let's begin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section1"></a></p>
<h2>1. Mornings Are The Most Productive Time Of The Day</h2>
<p>The most productive time of the day is between 5 AM and around 9 AM.</p>
<p>Waking up early provides you with 4 hours before other people wake up to get something done.</p>
<p>A 2011 study collected 590 million tweets from 2.3 million users and concluded that the mood a person wakes up in has a profound impact on their productivity.</p>
<p>The better the mood you wake up in, the higher your chances of being more productive.</p>
<div id="attachment_87777" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-87777" class="wp-image-87777 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mornings.jpeg" alt="woman looking at sunrise" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mornings.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mornings-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mornings-450x225.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-87777" class="wp-caption-text">If you wake up in a good mood, you will start the day right and be more productive.</p></div>
<p>So remember this, gentlemen; always start your day early with a glass half full and be the one who makes things happen!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section2"></a></p>
<h2>2. You Are More Focused In The Morning</h2>
<p>Most people don't think they can be more focused in the morning. This is not true!</p>
<p>Even if you aren't a morning person and you feel and look like a zombie when you wake up, your brain is still processing information.</p>
<p>This is also backed up by a study from 1975 out of the University of Sussex &#8211; it concluded that the time where people are the most focused is between 8 AM until 2 PM.</p>
<p>To be able to use this to your advantage, set some goals for yourself early in the morning and see how you perform.</p>
<p>You might surprise yourself with your ability to focus when you wake up early on those weekends.</p>
<div id="attachment_96109" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96109" class="wp-image-96109 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/27616642197_18f2e65fd3_z.jpg" alt="man looking a sticky notes" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/27616642197_18f2e65fd3_z.jpg 640w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/27616642197_18f2e65fd3_z-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/27616642197_18f2e65fd3_z-375x250.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96109" class="wp-caption-text">Set goals for yourself early in the morning, when you can focus better.</p></div>
<p>After that, you begin to lose focus and you can no longer perform at a higher level.</p>
<p>So make sure you make use of those early mornings and focus on all of the tasks you didn't get to do during the week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section3"></a></p>
<h2>3. There Are Fewer Interruptions</h2>
<p>If everyone is asleep, then there is no one to interrupt you.</p>
<p>You need to realize this and take advantage of it.</p>
<p>If you wake up at 5 AM on the weekend, you will not only have enough time to do whatever you want to do but you can do it in <strong>peace</strong>.</p>
<p>You can go for a run and not worry about cars or go to the gym and not worry about other people, because guess what &#8211; they will be at home sound asleep, which means they can't interrupt you.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">You have more time to yourself in the early morning since others won't interrupt you.</h4>
<p>The best way to leverage this is to do something that makes you feel good and proud.</p>
<p>Once you have finished doing everything that you wanted to do, you will be able to spend time with your family once they wake up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section4"></a></p>
<h2>4. Sleeping In DOESN'T Help You</h2>
<p>Those extra few hours that you lost during the weekday won't magically transfer if you sleep in on weekends.</p>
<p>If you sleep in for over 1 &#8211; 2 hours on weekends, your entire sleep pattern suddenly changes.</p>
<p>The brain still releases hormones just like it does every other day.</p>
<p>When you suddenly change your sleeping schedule on weekends &#8211; you will notice that you will wake up more tired.</p>
<p>Come Monday, you will find it even more difficult to wake up.</p>
<div id="attachment_52195" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-52195" class="wp-image-52195 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sleep.jpe" alt="Man comfortably sleeping in his bed" width="700" height="299" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sleep.jpe 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sleep-300x128.jpe 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sleep-450x192.jpe 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-52195" class="wp-caption-text">Wake up at the same time each day to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.</p></div>
<p>If you are having trouble waking up early, then maybe you should try <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/perfect-morning-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waking up a little earlier</a> each day and enjoy the benefits that come from this new routine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section5"></a></p>
<h2>5. Exercise Is More Effective In The Morning</h2>
<p>Waking up early to go to the gym is much more beneficial than going at a later time.</p>
<p>A 2013 study concluded that more muscle is added and more fat burned when you exercise in the morning.</p>
<p>This also is a great way to start the day, because you will be rested and full of energy and your body will have more time to adjust and &#8220;repair&#8221; itself throughout the day.</p>
<p>However, if you go to the gym after you've spent an entire day on your feet &#8211; guess what? You will perform less and your body won't be as effective in repairing itself.</p>
<div id="attachment_11803" style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11803" class="wp-image-11803 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/workout.jpg" alt="empty gym" width="635" height="311" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/workout.jpg 635w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/workout-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/workout-450x220.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /><p id="caption-attachment-11803" class="wp-caption-text">Use the early morning exercise to help your body recover properly.</p></div>
<p>You can also avoid the crowds at the gym since most people will decide to sleep in over the weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="nonsense"></a></p>
<h2>1. You Stop Dealing With Other People's Nonsense</h2>
<p>Robin Dunbar, a British anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist, conducted a study published in the 2016 Journal Social Networks.</p>
<p>By analyzing participants' call logs, he determined that the average person only has regular contact with around 5 people.</p>
<p>It's no surprise because, as you grow older, you adopt more responsibility and thus have less time.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest desires of young people include having lots of friends and being liked by everyone.</p>
<div id="attachment_96440" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96440" class="wp-image-96440 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/enough.jpg" alt="man looking displeased" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/enough.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/enough-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/enough-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96440" class="wp-caption-text">You get to a point where you've had enough, and you put your own interests first.</p></div>
<p>With age you start to realize that maintaining all these connections wastes a lot of your time.</p>
<p>After all, not everyone you know wants to be your friend, and you yourself don't like everyone you know.</p>
<p>As you have less time, you can no longer afford to waste it on people who impact you in a negative way.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the next thing should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="careless"></a></p>
<h2>2. You Care Less About What Other People Think</h2>
<p>We know that our social circle &#8211; at least the part we interact with &#8211; gets smaller with age, so we have less room for outside opinions.</p>
<p>As we grow older, the few connections we do maintain with close friends and family are all the support we need. There are plenty of opinions to go around.</p>
<p>The insight that comes from people that matter to us is more important. We no longer waste time on gossip and rumors, in fact, we avoid them for the trouble they've caused.</p>
<p>All this is a major stress release, as we can be sure the things we do hear &#8211; both positive and negative &#8211; come from the heart of people who only want the best for us.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>You'll never make it if you spend your time questioning yourself on what others will think of you.</em></h4>
<p>Throughout life, we're going to hear all sorts of things about ourselves and those around us. Some of it turns out to be true, but everything else becomes laughable.</p>
<p>Seriously, we learn to laugh at the negative things we hear about us &#8211; that would shock us as kids or young adults.</p>
<p>We also learn to appreciate those that give constructive criticism, which helps open our eyes on things we need to work on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. You Lose Your Hair &#8211; FAST</h2>
<p>One of the biggest fears most men face is seeing their hair start to fall off, but what really surprises them is just how quickly it happens.</p>
<p>According to the American Hair Loss Association, 2 out of 3 men will experience some form of male pattern baldness by the age of 35.</p>
<p>The causes include a variety of things: genetics, chemicals from hair products, stress and unhealthy eating patterns are just some of the well-known ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/conquer-male-baldness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We have an article dedicated to the top 10 of the most common causes of hair loss, as well as tips to overcome them.</a></p>
<div id="attachment_94741" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://keeps.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94741" class="wp-image-94741 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/keeps-hair-loss-in-men.jpg" alt="keeps hair loss in men" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/keeps-hair-loss-in-men.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/keeps-hair-loss-in-men-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/keeps-hair-loss-in-men-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94741" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://keeps.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeps has affordable treatment options to help you STOP hair loss in its tracks.

<p>Most people search for cures when it's already too late, and companies like Keeps realized this.</p>
<p>So instead they looked at the problem from another angle and focused on prevention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="seeyourself"></a></p>
<h2>4. You Start To See Yourself In Others</h2>
<p>When you were young, you had big dreams for when you grew up.</p>
<p>Most people want to leave an impact on this world in one way or another. This is why there are so many aspiring artists and sports players.</p>
<p>Others want to change the planet &#8211; many hope to end up in the history books.</p>
<p>Life teaches us that not everyone is destined to achieve worldwide recognition. But that doesn't mean their lives aren't impactful.</p>
<p>As you grow older, the relationships you maintain in life become more meaningful. It's no secret that we tend to act, talk and think like those who surround us, but we're not just sponges soaking everything up.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>The people around us become mirrors of ourselves.</em></h4>
<p>The good we say and do can inspire others to do the same, and we find that our friends, family and especially younger generations are inspired by us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're only human and make mistakes as well. Seeing people make the same mistakes we did, opens our eyes to the impact that we can have on others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="adoptvalues"></a></p>
<h2>5. You Adopt A Set Of Core Values</h2>
<p>We've all heard the saying &#8220;You become wiser as you age&#8221;.</p>
<p>Most people believe it's true, and psychology has pointed out good reasons why that is is the case.</p>
<p>As we grow older, the life lessons we've learned pile up. By now we have vast experience in all sorts of situations, and it feels like nothing can surprise us anymore.</p>
<p>All of this &#8211; the good and the bad &#8211; leads us to believe we understand what makes the world go around.</p>
<div id="attachment_96469" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-life-tips-military/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96469" class="wp-image-96469 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/us-marine-corps-1.jpg" alt="us marine corps antonio centeno" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/us-marine-corps-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/us-marine-corps-1-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/us-marine-corps-1-438x250.jpg 438w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-96469" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-life-tips-military/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A lot of my daily habits were adopted from my time in the U.S. Marine Corps. Click here to read my article on 10 life lessons from the military!</a></p></div>
<p>Being this &#8211; dare I say &#8211; arrogant about the things we know leads us to adopt core principles we live by. This is why people tend to be more conservative as they age.</p>
<p>But this is by no means a bad thing, having a set of <strong>values</strong> or <strong>rules</strong> we live by &#8211; assuming they benefit us while not hurting others &#8211; is a good way to approach life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>6. Life Events Become More Meaningful</h2>
<p>According to Psychology Today, adults report more emotional stability than younger people.</p>
<p>Adults pay more attention to the good, less attention to the bad, and recover more easily from negative feelings.</p>
<p>This may lead people to believe that you get less emotional overall as you age, but that's actually not the case.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>As we age, the responsibilities we adopt narrow our focus and make us more invested in the things around us.</em></h4>
<p>Even though adults react emotionally on fewer occasions than young people, their emotions are more powerful.</p>
<p>This is because older generations have had more life experience which has made them more resilient.</p>
<p>On the brighter side, the sense of achievement and pride in our accomplishments increases as well.</p>
<p>Since we, as responsible adults, play a role in our people's lives, we tend to view the success and failure of those around us as our own.</p>
<p>In other words, we develop higher levels of empathy as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="stress"></a></p>
<h2>7. You React Better To Stress</h2>
<p>We already talked about how you stop caring as much as you get older. Thankfully, this applies to stress as well.</p>
<p>Although there are many definitions of stress, people experience it in different ways.</p>
<p>Stress is a common reaction when feeling forced to do things &#8211; like make tough decisions or changing the way we do things.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about our results can leave us feeling uneasy. This is why work-related stress is so common amongst adults.</p>
<div id="attachment_96442" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96442" class="wp-image-96442 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-working.jpg" alt="man working" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-working.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-working-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-working-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96442" class="wp-caption-text">You can do it. After all, you've done it so many times before.</p></div>
<p>As you age, you go through many of the same life scenarios over and over again. With experience, the stress of &#8220;Can I do this?&#8221; becomes &#8220;No problem, I've done it so many times&#8221;.</p>
<p>The confidence that we can pull through &#8211; no matter what we're doing &#8211; is what releases us from everyday stress.</p>
<p>This is why experience is so valuable in life. It teaches us how to move forward where many decide to stop.</p>

<h2>8. You Finally Become A Morning Person</h2>
<p>Still wondering how your mom was able to wake up at 6 a.m. every morning, while you barely got up to get to school at 9 a.m.?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it's not just her. Adults wake up earlier in general and there are both medical and social reasons for it.</p>
<p>There's a reason why &#8220;9 to 5&#8221; is a term used to explain the average person's work schedule.</p>
<p>This basically means, whether you were a morning person or not when you were younger, the majority of the world wakes up and starts their day early.</p>
<div id="attachment_96443" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96443" class="wp-image-96443 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/alarm-clock.jpg" alt="alarm clock" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/alarm-clock.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/alarm-clock-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/alarm-clock-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96443" class="wp-caption-text">You might hate your alarm clock, but you should also be thankful to it for helping you keep up with the world.</p></div>
<p>Over time, the body starts to recognize a pattern in sleep time and adjusts accordingly &#8211; most people realize this.</p>
<p>This is how you get the feeling of naturally waking up at the same time every day, regardless of when you went to sleep.</p>
<p>The amount of sleep you get also goes down as you age, but it's not as bad as it may sound.</p>
<p>Simply put, as you age you expend less energy, and your body takes less time to recover during sleep.</p>
<p>That's why it's not unusual for the elderly to sleep for 6 hours, which they often compensate for by taking a nap during the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>9. Time Starts Flying By</h2>
<p>When you're young, all you think about is &#8220;when is this going to end so I can finally play, socialize and enjoy my free time?&#8221;</p>
<p>School never seems to end and the weekend is far away. Now, all you can think of is <strong>deadlines</strong>.</p>
<p>When you're young, you have a narrow view of the world. You interact with 90% of your social circle on a daily basis.</p>
<p>You likely lived with your parents and see them every day. Your friends were all in the same school and neighborhood as you.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>But as you grow older and your connections begin to scatter around, you realize just how precious your time is.</p>
<div id="attachment_96444" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96444" class="wp-image-96444 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wrist-watch.jpg" alt="wrist watch" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wrist-watch.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wrist-watch-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wrist-watch-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96444" class="wp-caption-text">Would you look at the time? Has it already been so many years?</p></div>
<p>The average person goes from living with their parents to seeing them only a couple of times a year once as soon as they move out.</p>
<p>You start having to schedule meetings with friends, sometimes days or weeks in advance, as life takes you on different paths and destinations.</p>
<p>Our social circle, which was once spread a just few streets wide, is now scattered &#8211; sometimes even globally.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, social media and the internet helps us keep up with the people in our lives, but it also serves as a reminder of how fast time can pass and how much can change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="happier"></a></p>
<h2>10. You Become Happier</h2>
<p>The San Diego School of Medicine at the University of California did a comprehensive study of 1,006 people.</p>
<p>They found that happiness levels start to go down after the age of 7, but rises back up again as you approach your 70s.</p>
<p>You learn to appreciate the little things in life that are positive, while &#8211; as we already mentioned &#8211; the negatives impact you less.</p>
<p>For most people, they find a place in their community, see their impact in it, and start to feel a sense of belonging.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>As you age, you start to love yourself for who you are and appreciate how far you've come in life.</em></h4>
<p>The responsibilities they adopt are more meaningful, both for one's self and others around them.</p>
<p>We spend the majority of our lives chasing things that we think are going to bring us happiness.</p>
<p>It is only when we realize that we might never get many of those things, that we start to appreciate life for what it gave us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<p>Without further ado, let's have a look at the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="buywinter"></a></p>
<h2>1. Buy Winter Clothing In The Summer</h2>
<p>When is the best time to buy winter clothing? Hint: it’s not holiday sales. Most clothing stores typically divide their collections to spring/summer and fall/winter.</p>
<p>Once a season is over and clothing for the next one starts rolling in, stores have insane clearance sales.</p>
<p>By then, you can’t expect them to have all the items still available, as most will be sold out, but those that are left are often ridiculously cheap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="usecash"></a></p>
<h2>2. Face The PAIN Of Spending (By Using Cash)</h2>
<p>A 2015 study published in the Journal Electronic Commerce Research and Applications set up an auction-like scenario and instructed half of the participants to pay with cash, and the other half with cards.</p>
<p>What they found is that those who were paying with cards were &#8211; unknowingly &#8211; willing to spend as much as 100% more than those with cash on the same items, even though they were given the same amount of money.</p>
<p>Simply put, seeing the money leave their hands made cash users more cautious of what they were buying and how much they were offering for it.</p>
<p>Shopping with cards is quick and easy &#8211; yes &#8211; but one of the best ways to <strong>trick</strong> yourself into saving money is bringing your budget in cash.</p>
<div id="attachment_96242" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96242" class="wp-image-96242 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pay-with-cash.jpg" alt="paying with cash" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pay-with-cash.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pay-with-cash-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pay-with-cash-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96242" class="wp-caption-text">Seeing your money leave your hands makes you rethink the purchase, doesn't it?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="sleeponit"></a></p>
<h2>3. If You're Unsure, Sleep On It</h2>
<p>Let's say you're looking at something and you're just about ready to buy it, but in the back of your head a voice is telling you something is not quite right.</p>
<p>Sure, the price tag says 50% off and it sounds like a great deal, but do you really need it? The best thing to do is leave it for now, sleep on it, and make the decision tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you still feel the need for it the next day &#8211; by all means &#8211; go and get it. But what you'll find is you'll often forget about it altogether.</p>
<p>This tip is especially useful when you're thinking about making a big purchase (new phone, car, house, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="drunkshopping"></a></p>
<h2>4. Don't Drink And Shop &#8211; Seriously</h2>
<p>A survey published by The Hustle, where 2000 regular alcohol consumers were asked about their shopping habits, concluded that people on average spend around 500$ a year on drunk shopping.</p>
<p>That might not sound like much, but when multiplied by the number of people in the world,  it's estimated that as much as <strong>$45 BILLION</strong> per year goes to shopping under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>It's no secret that alcohol is the <strong>key component</strong> in many stupid decisions, so it's no surprise many of these decisions involve spending money where you otherwise wouldn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="bepositive"></a></p>
<h2>5. Say Positive Things About What You Own</h2>
<p>One of the biggest influencers of impulse buying is having a negative attitude towards the things you own.</p>
<p>The next time you find yourself complaining about things you have, try to look at it from the other perspective.</p>
<p>Instead of saying &#8220;These shoes are so old, I need a new pair&#8221; say &#8220;I've had these shoes for over 3 years and they still look great&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than saying &#8220;The camera on this phone is so bad, the newer one has a 50MP camera&#8221; say &#8220;I've had this phone for 2 years and it never broke&#8221;</p>
<p>If you list the good against the bad, what you'll find is &#8211; more often than not- the good outweighs the bad.</p>
<div id="attachment_97255" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://rcl.ink/Ine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-97255" class="wp-image-97255 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Webp.net-compress-image-1.jpg" alt="shoptagr coupon code beta" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Webp.net-compress-image-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Webp.net-compress-image-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Webp.net-compress-image-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Webp.net-compress-image-1-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-97255" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://rcl.ink/Ine" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shoptagr just launched a new coupon feature where they'll scan the web at checkout to automatically apply relevant coupon codes to your purchase!</a></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="payday"></a></p>
<h2>6. Don't Shop On Your Payday</h2>
<p>As a matter of fact, don't shop for an entire week after you get your paycheck.</p>
<p>When you have money to spend, an item you would normally ignore suddenly becomes an item that would be nice to have.</p>
<p>A week after payday is typically the time you use to catch up on any expenses you have to pay, like bills, mortgage, bank loans, and so on.</p>
<p>After you've dealt with those, you'll have a clearer understanding of how much money you have left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="buylove"></a></p>
<h2>7. Only Buy The Things You LOVE</h2>
<p>It might sound cliche, but you should never settle for something you're not absolutely sure about.</p>
<p>Buying something out of necessity, thinking &#8220;this will have to suffice&#8221;, guarantees you aren't going to be happy with your purchase and you'll look to replace it in the future.</p>
<p>Once you buy the replacement item you wanted, you'll realize you have spares collecting dust.</p>
<p>If you just <strong>like it</strong>, don't buy it! It's better to shop smart and save money, than spend it on something you won't enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="affordthebest"></a></p>
<h2>8. Buy The Best You Can Afford (And Take Care Of It)</h2>
<p>Generally &#8211; the higher the quality, the higher the price. Don't trade quality in an attempt to save money.</p>
<p>It sounds counterintuitive, but let me explain. By buying high quality, you spend more money now, but save more money later.</p>
<p>Not only do higher quality items last longer &#8211; if you spend a decent amount on an item &#8211; you're naturally going to take better care of it.</p>
<p>The extra care in return extends the lifetime of the item even more &#8211; and it all goes full circle.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that expensive does not always mean high quality.</p>

<h2>9. <strong>Know What You're Paying For (Check your receipt</strong>)</h2>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with pulling out the calculator in the dressing room to see just how much you’re going to spend, especially when items are marked as “on-sale”.</p>
<p>This helps avoid overpaying or getting mislead by filler words such as &#8220;As much as X% off&#8221; or &#8220;Up to X% off&#8221;.</p>
<p>One time I went to the cash register with 3 items labeled 50% off. When I was told my total, I thought it was a little too high and asked the sales associate to check.</p>
<p>It turned out that none of the items were on sale and it was a mistake. If I added any more items to the bill, it might have missed that completely.</p>
<p>On a positive note, some stores will carefully hide little discount codes on their receipt, that say something like 30% of the cheapest item next time you buy or similar, so keep an eye out for that as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fakes"></a></p>
<h2>10. Don't Buy Fakes &#8211; Seriously</h2>
<p>I understand the urge to buy copies of items that are out of your budget, but they are a waste of money for many reasons.</p>
<p>You might think no one is going to notice you're wearing a fake Rolex and you're probably right &#8211; most people can't tell the difference.</p>
<p>However, knockoff items often have inflated prices because of the (fake) branding, and have very low quality.</p>
<p>Why spend $200 on a fake Rolex when the cheap metal is going to stain, the strap is going to break, the glass will scratch.</p>
<p>There are many other options available to you at various prices.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="hunt"></a></p>
<h2>11. Be Willing To Hunt</h2>
<p>Different stores offer similar items at different prices. We're used to menswear stores carrying pretty much everything, so we might feel as if we can finish shopping quickly by getting them all at the same place.</p>
<p>You need to understand how store prices work &#8211; they hook you in with low prices on some items (like shirts and pants) but other items (like socks and underwear) are intentionally more expensive.</p>
<p>They count on your laziness to overlook this fact and buy everything at the same time because it's more convenient.</p>
<p>But if you look at the receipt, you'll find that you spent $25 on a T-shirt and $35 on 3 pairs of socks.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to explore your options and then come back to the same store again on the same day if it means you'll save money (no, it doesn’t make you look stupid).</p>

Learn which stores give you the best deals for different items.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="knownames"></a></p>
<h2>12. Know Your Sales Associate By Name</h2>
<p>If you're like most guys, you tend to shop at the same places a lot. This means you were likely assisted by the same salesperson multiple times.</p>
<p>Befriend them, and they'll remember you and treat assisting you as a social interaction, rather than work.</p>
<p>The next time you shop, you can even ask for an additional discount. They often have some power in this, and they are more likely to use it for a familiar face.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can always ask them about upcoming sales, so you know the exact day to show up.</p>
<p>This way you can plan ahead, instead of randomly walking into a sale when weekend shopping &#8211; with 100 other people there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="makealist"></a></p>
<h2>13. Make A List Beforehand</h2>
<p>I know you've heard of this rule before, but I'm putting it in here for one simple reason &#8211; most men don't follow it.</p>
<p>How do I know this? Simple, I've heard it many times myself, but didn't do it.</p>
<p>But seriously, guys, having a clear plan of action is great. Set up a budget and make a list of items you want to buy.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>Once you buy everything off the list, you'll have an idea how much money you have left. This money can either be saved or spent on other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="perspective"></a></p>
<h2>14. Put Things Into Perspective</h2>
<p>Seeing an item outside of your budget on sale might make you think this is the best time to buy it, and it might be price-wise.</p>
<p>But before you buy it, think about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often do you expect to use it?</li>
<li>Are you buying it because you need it, or because it's on sale?</li>
<li>How much does it cost when you convert it into working hours?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do sales exist? To make people buy items they weren't sure about. After all, it's better for a company to make a small profit from you, than no profit at all.</p>
<h4>Time is money, and yours is valuable. Don't waste it chasing unnecessary spending goals.</h4>
<p><a name="loveit"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>15. Love Wearing It? Buy Multiples</h2>
<p>When you find the perfect size for an item you wear a lot, you should always buy a few more.</p>
<p>You can never have enough white shirts, basic t-shirts, favorite pairs of underwear and so on.</p>
<p>That way, even if something happens to one pair, you always have an extra on standby.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/things-every-man-should-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essential items</a> every guy needs to own multiple pairs of.</p>

<h2>16. <strong>Repurpose Old Clothing</strong></h2>
<p>A study done by DailyMail UK found that the average person has as much as 1200$ worth of clothing in their closet that they never wear.</p>
<p>Have you ever gone out and bought something, only to later find a similar thing in your closet, that you completely forgot about?</p>
<p>Clothes that we don't often wear get buried in the back of our closets and forgotten. Every now and then, it might be a good idea to take a look at what's hiding underneath.</p>
<p>Even if you're not going to wear it, you at least have an idea what you have &#8211; you can always look to sell or donate some of it.</p>
<p>Try to take all the items you never use and add up their prices. That's a lot of money wasted, wouldn't you say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tailortax"></a></p>
<h2>17. Beware Of The Tailor Tax</h2>
<p>Learn to fix basic problems on your clothing.</p>
<p>Many people go out and buy completely new clothing just because they don’t know how to sew on a loose button or the leg opening on the pants is too wide.</p>
<p>To avoid buying new clothing altogether, you can always take it to a tailor. But even then you're spending money on something you might be able to do on your own.</p>

<h2>18. <strong>Go Thrift Shopping<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span class="" title=""> Many people are biased about thrift stores and buying what's &#8211; for the most part &#8211; used clothing. People who shop at thrift stores can tell you just how ridiculous that bias is.</span></span></p>
<p>Try it for yourself and you'll be surprised at what you can find. Many of the items were never worn and some will still have original price tags attached to them so you know just how much you saved.</p>
<p>Some items go directly from big retailers into thrift stores as part of a donation, or they offer thrift stores low bulk prices for leftover items.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>Since the nature of thrift stores is donation and repurposing, many of them have special charity programs with local communities.</p>
<p>That's means not only are you saving money, but you're also helping those in need along the way.</p>
<p>Some thrift stores will even offer to buy your old clothing, either for cash or shop credit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="borrow"></a></p>
<h2>19. <strong>Borrow Or Rent What You’ll Wear Once</strong></h2>
<p>This tip comes directly from the ladies &#8211; they exchange clothing all the time and it’s super effective.</p>
<p>They also rent things like jewelry, bags, shoes, etc.</p>
<p>Guys should do this too – If you can borrow something from a friend, do it.</p>
<p>Renting a tux is a normal thing to do, but nowadays you can pretty much rent anything: suits, sports gear, travel bags, suitcases and many more.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="trends"></a></p>
<h2>20. Skip Out On Trends &#8211; Buy Timeless Items</h2>
<p>Fashion trends come and go. Clothing stores keep track of what's &#8220;trending&#8221;, so popular items are often intentionally pricier than those that are always in stock.</p>
<p>When buying a clothing item, make sure it matches your other clothes.</p>
<p>Stick to basics &#8211; don't buy things with unnecessary additions to them (like graphic t-shirts) &#8211; it makes it less interchangeable.</p>
<p>Unless an item has a specific level of formality &#8211; like a tuxedo &#8211; you should be able to dress it up and down with everything else you’ve got in the closet.</p>
<p>Find what colors work for you and stick to those – no matter how much you like an item, if it doesn’t fit with everything else you’ve got, it’s going to lay in the back of the closet and you'll get no wears out of it.</p>

<p><a name="subscribe"></a></p>
<h2>21. <strong>Subscribe for discounts</strong></h2>
<p>Checking online for discounts is a well-known shopping tip to save money and time.</p>
<p>Some stores offer discounts if you subscribe to things like their email newsletter or you do a quick survey for them, so make use of that old e-mail.</p>
<p>Check for discount codes online – make use of that search engine and don’t be afraid to ask on the store's social media pages for any online-only deals.</p>
<p>Use sites like Amazon and eBay for things you can buy used, or that you don’t need to see in person to be able to buy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What's the best way to wear a suit in hot weather?</p>
<p>Well, that's a good question.</p>
<p>I asked a friend of mine who worked as a bouncer in Las Vegas and he had a unique way of keeping cool.</p>
<p>He would cut the sleeves off his dress shirt and cover it with a blazer. He instantly felt cooler and no one else could see it.</p>
<p>He gave me a bonus tip as well &#8211; he ripped out the fabric in the back of his blazer to help cool him down.</p>

</ol>
<p>So let's begin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section1"></a></p>
<h2>1. Pay Attention To The Jacket's Lining</h2>
<p>The lining on a jacket is extra fabric between the outer fabric of a jacket and your body.</p>
<p>It also gives the jacket structure.</p>
<div id="attachment_96514" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/jacket-lining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96514" class="wp-image-96514 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jacket-lining-02.jpg" alt="different types of jacket linings" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jacket-lining-02.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jacket-lining-02-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jacket-lining-02-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-96514" class="wp-caption-text">When it comes to jacket linings, there are a few types. <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/jacket-lining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unlined, Quarter-Lined, Half-Lined and Fully-Lined</a>.</p></div>
<p>Most jackets out there are fully lined, giving them a defined shape.</p>
<p>Unlined jackets have the least structure but are much more breathable.</p>
<p>The best option is the half-lined jacket.</p>
<p>It is both breathable and comfortable during hot days, but you still have a structure in the upper part of the jacket, which is especially important for the shoulder area, as it builds the shoulders up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. Use The Right Fabric</h2>
<p>When it comes to fabrics, there are many different options that can be used for hot weather.</p>
<p>Linen, cotton and tropical wool&#8230;</p>
<p>The usual suspects.</p>
<div id="attachment_96400" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96400" class="wp-image-96400 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fabricsforheat.jpg" alt="different fabrics for heat" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fabricsforheat.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fabricsforheat-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fabricsforheat-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96400" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure you pick the right fabrics for the summer in order to stay cool.</p></div>
<p>Linen suits are great for summertime because they are extremely thin. Linen is also a natural fabric and as you know, natural fabrics are more breathable and more comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>The issue with linen clothing in general, however, is that it wrinkles very easily. For that reason, I advise you to keep an iron nearby in case you need to <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/iron-your-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iron your suit!</a></p>
<p>Cotton suits are going to be a little bit different because the fabric is thicker than in linen suits.</p>
<p>Just like linen, cotton is a natural material so it will still provide comfort and breathability.</p>
<p>You also don't have to worry as much about wrinkling.</p>
<p>Tropical and lightweight wool is great because wool is the best material a suit can be made out of.</p>
<p>The great thing about tropical wool is that it is durable and very soft to the touch.</p>
<p>If you need to dress formally<span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> I suggest you go with tropical wool, simply because cotton and linen suits are considered to be more casual than wool suits in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section3"></a></p>
<h2>3. Pick The Right Color</h2>
<p>Picking the right suit color is very important because certain colors absorb heat a lot more than others.</p>
<p>The darker the suit of your color is, the more heat it will absorb and the hotter you will feel.</p>
<p>The best colors you could pick for a suit in hot weather are tan, off white, beige, light gray or light blue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_96401" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96401" class="wp-image-96401 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/color-and-temperature.png" alt="impact of color and temperature" width="700" height="327" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/color-and-temperature.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/color-and-temperature-300x140.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/color-and-temperature-450x210.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96401" class="wp-caption-text">Picking the right color is an important factor for staying cool.</p></div>
<p>The color you choose will depend on the message you are trying to send.</p>
<p>If you are going to a very formal event, a darker color would be the best choice, because darker colors are seen as more serious and more formal than lighter colors.</p>
<p>However, if it's a more casual event, you are best off with a light gray suit or a light blue suit. These colors, although less formal than black, are still considered formal enough to be worn to most events that require a suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section4"></a></p>
<h2>4. Layer Up!</h2>
<p>For most people, the idea of layering in the summer will come as a shock.</p>
<p>When you wear a suit in hot weather, the fact is you're going to sweat &#8211; a lot.</p>
<div id="attachment_96186" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://info.thompsontee.com/rmrs25off " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96186" class="wp-image-96186 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thompsontee.jpg" alt="man in a white undershirt" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thompsontee.jpg 500w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thompsontee-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thompsontee-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thompsontee-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-96186" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://info.thompsontee.com/rmrs25off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wearing the right undershirt can be a lifesaver and Thompson Tee has exactly what you need.</a></p></div>
<p>Combined with a long-sleeved dress shirt underneath &#8211; you have a recipe for sweat stains under your armpits.</p>
<p>However, if you wear a quality undershirt, you will save yourself the stress of having to change your shirt the second you get into your office.</p>
<p>The right shirt under your dress shirt will absorb the sweat and make you feel cooler when you rock your suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section5"></a></p>
<h2>5. Don't Be Afraid To Break The Rules</h2>
<p>I often mention that sometimes it is OK to break certain rules.</p>
<p>When it comes to feeling cooler in suits, you have some leeway to play with the rules.</p>
<p>Those of you who have been following me for some time, know about <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/suit-button-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suit buttoning rules</a>.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">When it's hot, some style rules can be broken to keep cool.</h4>
<p>When it comes down to rules such as these<span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> it is perfectly fine for you to wear an unbuttoned suit whenever you're standing.</p>
<p>When you're in hot weather, keep your suit unbuttoned so that you can keep cool.</p>
<p>If your suit jacket is unbuttoned, more air can come through and you are less likely to get hot and to sweat.</p>
<p>You can also do the same for your suit and shirt sleeves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section6"></a></p>
<h2>6. Wear The Right Shirt</h2>
<p>People often overlook the importance of wearing the right shirt.</p>
<p>In most cases, the shirt you wear will be in direct contact with your skin, so you want to make sure that it's high quality.</p>
<p>Your best option is to pick a linen or a 100% cotton shirt.</p>
<div id="attachment_96515" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96515" class="wp-image-96515 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/guy-in-a-white-linen-shirt.jpg" alt="guy in a white linen shirt" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/guy-in-a-white-linen-shirt.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/guy-in-a-white-linen-shirt-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/guy-in-a-white-linen-shirt-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96515" class="wp-caption-text">Choosing a lightweight shirt material, such as linen, can keep your body temperature down and make you feel cooler.</p></div>
<p>Linen, as I already mentioned, is a very lightweight natural material that breathes easily, so you'll feel the most comfortable when wearing it.</p>
<p>What about wrinkles? Since you'll be wearing a blazer, they won't be as visible on the shirt. You can also wear darker colors to mitigate their visibility.</p>
<p>You might also want to take a look at performance shirts made out of specific materials that prevent wrinkling and sweating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section7"></a></p>
<h2>7. Focus On The Fit</h2>
<p>You all know my most important rule.</p>
<p>Fit is king.</p>
<p>Yes, gentlemen, when you wear anything, especially a suit, the way it fits should be your first priority.</p>
<div id="attachment_96516" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96516" class="wp-image-96516 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summer-fit.jpg" alt="guy wearing a white suit" width="700" height="384" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summer-fit.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summer-fit-300x165.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summer-fit-450x247.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96516" class="wp-caption-text">When it comes to the fit of your clothes during the summer, it is best to have a looser fit for breathability.</p></div>
<p>However, this goes hand in hand with my point about breaking the style rules.</p>
<p>When you wear a suit in the summer, you want to go for a <strong>looser</strong> fit.</p>
<p>Be careful that you don't go with too loose of a fit though, otherwise you'll look ridiculous.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to wear your trousers with no break or to even cuff your trousers &#8211; it will be a little more casual, but you will still look good &#8211; and more importantly, feel cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section8"></a></p>
<h2>8. Pay Attention To Your Footwear</h2>
<p>Footwear is important year-round, so it comes as no surprise that I'm bringing it up again.</p>
<p>In the summer, your feet can get sweaty and smelly. You need to choose your footwear carefully.</p>
<p>Your go-to summer shoe should be a <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/summer-style-mens-loafers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loafer</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_95776" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95776" class="wp-image-95776 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers.jpg" alt="man wearing loafers" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers-445x250.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95776" class="wp-caption-text">A loafer is your best friend during the summer.</p></div>
<p>Since the quarter isn't as high as other dress shoes, your feet will have more breathing room.</p>
<p>You can also pick between grain leather or suede leather to dress up or dress up or dress down your outfit.</p>
<p>Loafers look great with regular socks, but with no show socks as well.</p>
<p>However, remember that if you wear no show socks, it might be a good idea to roll your trousers up a bit. This will add some flair to your outfit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section9"></a></p>
<h2>9. Create Your Own Shade</h2>
<p>Simply put, bring back the hat.</p>
<p>No, not that old baseball hat with your favorite team's logo.</p>
<p>The hat I'm referring to is the classic Panama hat. Learn how to wear it, embrace it and rock it with pride.</p>
<div id="attachment_93726" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93726" class="wp-image-93726 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama.jpg" alt="man wearing a panama hat" width="700" height="488" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama-359x250.jpg 359w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-93726" class="wp-caption-text">A Panama hat is one of the timeless pieces that will never go out of style.</p></div>
<p>A benefit of wearing a hat is also that you, in essence, create your own shade. It's protective AND stylish!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section10"></a></p>
<h2>10. Watch What You Eat</h2>
<p>Taking care of your body and watching what you put in it is very important.</p>
<p>However, in the summer, this becomes even more important because the food you eat has a direct impact on how hot you'll feel.</p>
<p>There are certain foods that make you feel cooler and certain foods that make you feel hotter.</p>
<div id="attachment_95911" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95911" class="wp-image-95911" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit.jpg" alt="fruit in a bowl and on the table" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95911" class="wp-caption-text">Eating fruit can make you feel cooler during the summer.</p></div>
<p>For instance, if you eat watermelon or strawberries you'll feel cooler. The same applies to staying hydrated.</p>
<p>You want to avoid food that has a lot of fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Interestingly, ice cream, beer, and brown rice are common summer treats that should actually be avoided.</p>
<p>Make sure you remember that the next time you finish doing something during a hot day and want ice cream or beer, you're probably better off eating a bowl of strawberries to help cool you down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women value texting as a means of communication much higher than men do and often use it as a first step in filtering out potential relationships &#8211; both romantic and otherwise.</p>
<p>Don't believe me? Just ask a female friend.</p>
<p>The Journal of Computers in Human Behavior published a study in 2018, about texting and relationship satisfaction.</p>
<p>They concluded that similarity in texting behavior was a good indicator of success in relationships both short and long term.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96208" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Texts_You_Should_NEVER_Send_A_Woman-700x400.jpg" alt="15 Texts You Should NEVER Send A Woman (Or Face The Consequences)" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Texts_You_Should_NEVER_Send_A_Woman-700x400.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Texts_You_Should_NEVER_Send_A_Woman-700x400-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Texts_You_Should_NEVER_Send_A_Woman-700x400-438x250.jpg 438w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>In 2010, the Pew Research Center also conducted a study on texting. It showed that &#8211; on average &#8211; teen boys would receive 30 texts a day, while girls would receive as much as 80 &#8211; and that the number was increasing with age.</p>
<p>Examining the contents of the texts, they concluded that girls mainly used texting to socialize, while boys used it for passing information.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, it comes as no surprise that &#8211; yes &#8211; women <strong>JUDGE</strong> you based on the way you text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Never thought texting was this serious? Well you should now. To make texting a bit easier for you, here are 15 texts you should NEVER send to a woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="noresponse"></a></p>
<h2>1. &#8220;Why Aren't You Answering Me?!&#8221; (The Aggressive Text)</h2>
<p>Women spend a lot of time using their phone to entertain themselves, much more than men do.</p>
<p>When a woman doesn’t answer a text, there are 3 likely reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>She’s busy &#8211; in which case she will respond as soon as she gets the time.</li>
<li>She forgot &#8211; in which case she will respond as soon as she thinks of you again.</li>
<li>She doesn’t want to &#8211; in which case, well, you've probably done something wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of which one it is, the worst thing you could do is text her something like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_96082" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96082" class="wp-image-96082 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1.jpg" alt="texting scenario one" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96082" class="wp-caption-text">Pushing for an answer with a text like this comes off as aggressive, mistrusting and needy.</p></div>
<p>Guys send this text when they panic, thinking a woman is ignoring them or losing interest. Whether that's the case or not, demanding an answer almost always makes the situation worse.</p>
<p>Women view texting as casual socializing, so an answer ASAP is not guaranteed. If you have something important to talk about, it’s always better to just call them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="thatguy"></a></p>
<h2>2. &#8220;Who's That Guy?!&#8221; (The Jealous Text)</h2>
<p>This text typically gets sent when a guy sees a woman he's interested in with another man, but he's unsure who that man is and what his relationship with her is.</p>
<p>But here's the reality of the situation;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you know her well, and that was someone important in her life, she would have mentioned him.</li>
<li>If you don’t know her well, it’s probably none of your business &#8211; if it was she would tell you.</li>

<p>Why demand an answer to a question that would answer itself anyway?</p>
<p>If you want to bring it up because you're genuinely curious, either do it in person or don't make it the topic of the conversation.</p>
<p>An alternative like &#8220;I saw you with someone and I didn't want to bother you&#8221; is a much better option, as it's a friendly invitation for her to explain who he was, and what they were doing.</p>

<h2>3. &#8220;Think I'll Go To Bed Early Today&#8230;&#8221; (The &#8220;White&#8221; Lies)</h2>
<p>Small lies, which guys often use to impress a woman, can accumulate over time.</p>
<p>She might think you're cool at that moment, but at some point those lies are going to rise to the surface and everything you say or do from that day forward will be seen as untrustworthy.</p>

<p>On top of that, if she catches you lying through text, she even has proof &#8211; expect screenshots to be thrown right back in your face.</p>
<p>In fact, you should avoid lying altogether, regardless of if it's through text or not.</p>

<h2>4. &#8220;Where Do You Want To Go?&#8221; (The Indecisive Text)</h2>
<p>Gentlemen, it's a fact that over 90% of first dates are initiated by men.</p>
<p>Many men, when they ask a woman out and she says “yes”, follow up by saying something along the lines of “what do you want to do/where do you want to go?”</p>
<p>Guys think this is good because they let the woman choose and think that she’ll appreciate it, while women think it’s just lazy.</p>
<div id="attachment_96101" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96101" class="wp-image-96101 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/4.jpg" alt="the indicisive text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/4.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/4-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/4-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96101" class="wp-caption-text">One of the biggest first date mistakes &#8211; according to women &#8211; is guys not having a clear plan of action.</p></div>
<p>The first thing that pops into a woman's head when she reads a text like this is “how should I know, you’re the one who asked me out…”. It shows that no creativity or thought was put into the date.</p>
<p>Before asking a woman out you should make sure you know her interests and can find something that you can both enjoy, or if you’re going to a simple drink/coffee date make sure to pick a place that's convenient for the both of you.</p>

<h2>5. &#8220;Please, Give Me Another Chance&#8230;&#8221; (The Pleading Text)</h2>
<p>If you are in a situation where you feel like sending this kind of text, chances are you messed up so badly there’s no way any sort of short term apology will fix it.</p>
<p>What's more, when you beg someone for something, it gives them power over you.</p>
<p>It’s basically telling THEM they control YOUR fate, and not that your relationship involves both parties making decisions.</p>

Apologize properly and make it up to them with actions, not words.</p></div>
<p>Texts like these come off as clingy and make it seem as if you have no other options, so you result to begging.</p>
<p>In the best-case scenario, the woman will just ignore them. But in the worst case, she may feel entitled to use that shift of power you just gave her, and rub it in your face.</p>
<p>Owning up to your mistakes and actually making an effort to fix it will produce results, even if it takes time.</p>

<h2>6. &#8220;Hey, What's Up?&#8221; (The Everyday, Boring Text)</h2>
<p>Sending a random text like this without any context or intent to follow up with a story and start an actual conversation, is downright boring.</p>
<p>According to most women, they get them from guys on pretty much a daily basis.</p>
<div id="attachment_96107" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96107" class="wp-image-96107 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/6.jpg" alt="the boring everyday text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/6.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/6-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/6-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96107" class="wp-caption-text">Want to show her you're &#8220;not like all the other guys&#8221;? Good, stop sending the same text that every other guy she meets sends her.</p></div>
<p>Texts like this are unoriginal, the conversations feel forced and often don’t last, meaning the woman won’t put effort into them &#8211; as historically they didn't prove to bring any value to her.</p>
<p>Guys who send these come off as having nothing to say and are just begging for her attention. If you're going to text, make sure you have something to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>7. &#8220;What Do You Do? Where Do You Live?&#8221; (The Rapid Fire Questions)</h2>
<p>When a guy feels a woman is unresponsive &#8211; or he simply doesn't know how to make texting fun &#8211; he might try to phrase every text as a question thinking &#8220;She has to respond now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand, women get annoyed by these texts because &#8211; not only do many guys send them &#8211; it makes it sound like they are being interviewed.</p>
<div id="attachment_96110" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96110" class="wp-image-96110 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/7.jpg" alt="the non stop questions text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/7.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/7-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/7-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96110" class="wp-caption-text">It's supposed to be a text conversation, not a job interview.</p></div>
<p>When people feel like they are being interviewed or screened it removes the fun from the conversation, as the person receiving the questions feels pressured to answer.</p>
<p>This pressure often leads to the responses being only one sentence long or simply stating facts. Or worse yet, you end up with dishonest answers altogether.</p>
<p>Texting “what do you do for a living?”, for example, is fine and shows interest, but following her answer up with another question instead of expanding on what she said is what changes the text from &#8220;conversation&#8221; to &#8220;Q&A time&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>8. &#8220;Just Checking Up On You&#8230;&#8221; (The Insecure Text)</h2>
<p>So you haven't heard from her in what seems like forever at this point, what should you do?</p>
<p>One of the texts you should never send to a woman is a text questioning her actions and whereabouts.</p>
<div id="attachment_96112" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96112" class="wp-image-96112 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8.jpg" alt="the insecure text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96112" class="wp-caption-text">If any of this information was of value to you in her mind, she would have told you upfront.</p></div>
<p>Checking up on her &#8211; to see if everything is okay &#8211; is fine, but demanding information and being possessive is always a turn-off. After all, she has a life outside of your relationship, no matter how serious it is between the two of you.</p>
<p>If you push too hard, she’s either going to stop talking to you or start outright lying to you. Even worse, you might frighten her by making her think you’re randomly going to show up uninvited, or that you might be following her.</p>

<p><a name="emotional"></a></p>
<h2>9. &#8220;I Want You To Have My Babies!&#8221; (The Overwhelming, Emotional Text)</h2>
<p>She might appreciate that you feel that way about her, but sending an overly emotional text puts too much pressure on the woman to respond.</p>
<p>The response requires emotional thought to be put into it &#8211; &#8220;do I like him back, do I agree or disagree&#8221; – and it's risky because you don't know what state of mind she's in at the moment.</p>
<p>For example &#8211; if she had a bad day &#8211; she might have texted you to get away from things, and all of a sudden she gets a text that asks her to share her emotions.</p>
<div id="attachment_96113" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96113" class="wp-image-96113 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/9.jpg" alt="the overwhelming emotion text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/9.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/9-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/9-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96113" class="wp-caption-text">These kinds of texts close off the conversation and take it from fun to serious. It becomes a &#8220;make it or break it&#8221; scenario for her.</p></div>
<p>If she doesn’t feel the same way, this can lead to conflict, and the woman might ignore the conversation going forward to avoid escalation.</p>
<p>If she does feels the same, she might try to reserve it until you meet up, to save for the right moment. This might be misinterpreted as her ignoring you.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if she responds right away with something like “me too” it’s going to create a ton of pressure next time you meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="apology"></a></p>
<h2>10. &#8220;Sorry, Sorry, So Sorry&#8230;&#8221; (The Forced Apology Text)</h2>
<p>Dragging out an apology &#8211; after she already forgave you &#8211; is annoying and it’s an obvious beg for attention.</p>
<p>Most women are used to the fact that, when they get a text like that, a lame “I want to make it up to you&#8221; response will follow.</p>
<p>The text usually blows things out of proportions intentionally, so the guy can make an unnecessary or excessive offer in exchange for his mistake.</p>
<div id="attachment_96115" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96115" class="wp-image-96115 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10.jpg" alt="the forced apology text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96115" class="wp-caption-text">Don't force her to accept an &#8220;apology gift&#8221;, especially if she didn't ask for it.</p></div>
<p>Using an apology to ask a woman out somewhere is a tactic that women recognize and despise since they know you are trying to make her go out with you by using pity.</p>
<p>If you genuinely want to make it up to her, you can start by asking what you can do to correct the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>You: &#8220;Sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday, is there anything I can do to make up for it?&#8221;</li>
<li>Her: &#8220;YES! Come over tomorrow for some leftover cake.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>See? Easy&#8230;</p>

<h2>11. &#8220;Are You Sure, Though?&#8221; (The Seeking Approval Text)</h2>
<p>Don’t send texts blatantly seeking her approval to do something important to you or something that you should be fully capable of deciding to do yourself.</p>
<p>She won't hate you if you decide to change plans or exclude her from them, as long as it's done respectfully and with enough notice for her to make her own changes. You could also then offer to catch up with her another time.</p>

Once you get your answer, say &#8220;thank you&#8221; and don't drag it on.</p></div>
<p>According to women, one of the worst traits a guy can have is to be constantly seeking approval from people and relying too much on the opinion of others.</p>
<p>Women like it when a guy is decisive and doesn't evade responsibility, and these men have thicker skin than other guys &#8211; they can take &#8220;No&#8221; for an answer, and women like this.</p>

<p><a name="entertainme"></a></p>
<h2>12. &#8220;I'm Bored&#8221; (The Entertain Me Text)</h2>
<p>When you send a text like this, you paint yourself as a boring person with not much going for you.</p>
<p>This makes you unattractive to women &#8211; it makes it seem as if you don't value your time and rely on others to fill out your day.</p>
<div id="attachment_96118" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96118" class="wp-image-96118 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/12.jpg" alt="the entertain men text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/12.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/12-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/12-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96118" class="wp-caption-text">Don't reach out to her, expecting her to make the conversation for you.</p></div>
<p>On top of many women's lists of reasons why someone left a bad impression is: “He’s a total bore&#8230;”</p>
<p>The fact is, she's not here to entertain you. If you can’t even entertain yourself, what kind of catch are you going to be to her?</p>

<h2>13. &#8220;Good Morning, Sunshine.&#8221; (The Fake Nice Text)</h2>
<p>Sending a &#8220;good morning&#8221; text too early in a relationship just doesn't work. Lots of guys do it to try and grab the woman's attention first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Women think it’s pointless &#8211; it comes off as trying too hard. Even if the guy is truly super nice, it will likely be interpreted as fake.</p>
<div id="attachment_96152" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96152" class="wp-image-96152 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/13-1.jpg" alt="the fake nice text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/13-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/13-1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/13-1-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96152" class="wp-caption-text">Don't text first thing in the morning. Reserve the texting for evenings, to catch up on each other’s days.</p></div>
<p>There’s not much she can follow up with because her mornings are usually reserved for work or study-related things.</p>
<p>She might still be tired, and chances are she doesn't have time to chat, which makes it more likely for her to forget to respond or send a <strong>half-answer</strong> that neither of you are happy with.</p>

<p><a name="selfie"></a></p>
<h2>14. &#8220;Like What You See?&#8221; (The Bragging Selfie)</h2>
<p>Sending a selfie without giving a context is in the same category as number 6 on this list.</p>
<p>This is because you give her no reason to respond with more than just a few words. The best thing you can hope for is a &#8220;heart eye&#8221; emoji if you look good in the picture.</p>
<p>Even if you do look good, you still might come off as a showoff.</p>
<div id="attachment_96132" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96132" class="wp-image-96132 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/14-1.jpg" alt="the pointless selfie text" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/14-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/14-1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/14-1-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96132" class="wp-caption-text">If you’re going to send a picture, make sure it has a story attached to it.</p></div>
<p>Sending a woman pointless selfies is bad because &#8211; if she’s interested in you &#8211; she’s already checking your social media pages which are likely full of photos.</p>
<p>If you have something to show her, then, by all means, send a picture but make it obvious what you're trying to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>You: “Check out this outfit I wore today!”</li>
<li>Her: “What’s the occasion?”</li>
<li>You: &#8220;Nothing, just thought I'd wear a suit for a change!&#8221;</li>

<h2>15. &#8220;K&#8221; (The One Word Response)</h2>
<p>We’ve all been in scenarios when we share something interesting and expect a reaction, only to have the other person say something as simple as “alright” or &#8220;k&#8221;.</p>
<p>It makes us feel as if the other person either wasn’t listening or they were just waiting for us to finish what we were saying because they weren't interested in what we had to say.</p>

<p>If your intent is to close the conversation by using a one-word response, a much better way would be to use something like “Thanks for letting me know, talk soon”.</p>
<p>This lets the other person know their effort in the interaction was appreciated and you expect there to be more of it in the future, just not now.</p>

<h2>Summary &#8211; 15 Texts You Should Never Send A Woman</h2>

<p>It's really annoying to have to decipher a text message filled with filler words and emojis. <a href="https://youtu.be/YMGQG1PyjO4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to watch our video on whether or not women like emojis.</a></p>
<p>So pay attention to grammar, it's better to make that small effort than to risk coming off as lazy or unintelligent.</p>

<p>There's no doubt that women have plenty of legitimate issues, but don't we as well?</p>
<p>As men, there are plenty of problems that only we experience &#8211; be they physical or social.</p>

<p>So how do we deal with them?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, today I'm covering 5 issues unique to men and how to deal with them.</p>

<li><a href="#issue1"><strong>The Hover Hand</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#issue2"><strong>We're Always Supposed To Be In The Mood</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#issue3"><strong>We Have To Make The First Move</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#issue4"><strong>We Die Much Sooner</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#issue5"><strong>We Suck At Emotions</strong></a></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="issue1"></a></p>
<h2>1. The Hover Hand</h2>
<p>First on our list is the infamous hover hand. What is it? It refers to instances where men put their arms around a woman without touching her, usually while posing for a picture.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are gods among us who manage to pull it off. Keanu Reeves drew a lot of positive press by doing it on a regular basis.</p>
<div id="attachment_96087" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96087" class="wp-image-96087 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/keanu-reeves-hover-hand.jpg" alt="keanu reeves hover hand" width="700" height="531" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/keanu-reeves-hover-hand.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/keanu-reeves-hover-hand-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/keanu-reeves-hover-hand-330x250.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-96087" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keanu might be able to pull this off, but most seem to lack confidence. Click here to find out more about leveling up your confidence.</a></p></div>
<p>For us mortals, however, it doesn't have the same effect. In fact, it sends a clear signal that you lack confidence. The more beautiful the woman, the more prominently the hover hand appears.</p>
<p>How to fix this? Easy: <strong>Reciprocate.</strong></p>
<p>If you're posing with a woman and she gets up against you or puts her own arm around you,  it's perfectly ok to return the gesture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="issue2"></a></p>
<h2>2. We're Always Expected To Be &#8220;In The Mood&#8221;</h2>
<p>As men, we have to deal with a number of stereotypes. One of them is that we're always ready to get busy. Sometimes, we conform to that pressure even when we don't want to.</p>
<p>According to therapists, the evidence points to the contrary. In a survey of 200 men, an interesting trend showed up: Sex stops being a priority for men over 40.</p>
<p>Factors like the job, family, and other responsibilities take precedence.</p>
<div id="attachment_87803" style="width: 774px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.getroman.com/RMRS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-87803" class="wp-image-87803 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/roman-erectile-dysfunction1.jpg" alt="get roman sponsored image" width="764" height="400" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/roman-erectile-dysfunction1.jpg 764w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/roman-erectile-dysfunction1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/roman-erectile-dysfunction1-450x236.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-87803" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.getroman.com/RMRS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out Roman and get a free online visit and free two-day shipping.</a></p></div>
<p>Another finding was that when men feel emotionally distant from their partner, their sexual desire is greatly lessened.</p>
<p>Not in the mood? That's ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="issue3"></a></p>
<h2>3. We Always Have To Make The First Move</h2>
<p>Building off a little from point 2, another men's issue is the fact that we're obliged to make the first move.</p>
<p>Don't believe me? Let's talk statistics. A 2011 study found that 94% of women expect to be asked out as opposed to 16% of men. However, that percentage of men far outweighs the 6% of women who would rather ask first.</p>
<div id="attachment_94272" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/how-attract-women-without-talking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94272" class="size-full wp-image-94272" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29.jpg" alt="conversation date" width="700" height="530" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29-330x250.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94272" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/how-attract-women-without-talking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to find out how to make the first move without saying a word.</a></p></div>
<p>This means we're more likely to experience rejection as well.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, there's just no getting around it. You're probably going to be making the first move whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>The best way to learn is practice. The more you try approaching women, the better you'll learn to deal with rejection, and the higher your likelihood of success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="issue4"></a></p>
<h2>4. We Die Much Sooner</h2>
<p>It sucks, but men die faster than women.</p>
<p>A 2016 article out of the Harvard Medical Blog cited some alarming statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>57% of people over 67 are women.</li>
<li>67% of people over 85 are women.</li>
<li>On average, women outlive us for 5 years.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_96090" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96090" class="wp-image-96090 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-check-up-1.jpeg" alt="doctor check up" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-check-up-1.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-check-up-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-check-up-1-376x250.jpeg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96090" class="wp-caption-text">Remember to keep up with your yearly medical checkups.</p></div>
<p>Why does this happen? A few factors come into play.</p>
<p>Firstly, biology is a big factor. The frontal lobe of our brains develop much slower than women, increasing the likelihood of us taking unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>We're 50% more likely to die from preventable heart conditions, such as high cholesterol and untreated blood pressure.</p>
<p>Be careful and go to the doctor, gents!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="issue5"></a></p>
<h2>5. We Suck At Emotions</h2>
<p>Society tells men they can't express emotions besides anger, and that's a men's issue more people need to address.</p>
<p>We're under constant pressure to emulate the &#8220;Marlboro Man&#8221;; tough, independent, and perpetually stoic character. This applies to men all over the globe. This results in a condition called <strong>Normative Male Alexithymia (NMA)</strong>, where men bottle their emotions and fail to express them productively thanks to societal factors.</p>
<div id="attachment_96158" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96158" class="wp-image-96158 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/angry-man-walking.jpg" alt="angry man walking" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/angry-man-walking.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/angry-man-walking-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/angry-man-walking-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96158" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure to express your emotions in a productive way.</p></div>
<p>Gents, it is absolutely critical that you admit to yourself that it's ok to feel sad, happy, or sensitive. Act accordingly &#8211; seek help when needed and express yourself to your friends and family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary &#8211; 5 Men's Issues We All Deal With</h2>

<li><a href="#issue1"><strong>The Hover Hand</strong></a></li>

</ol>
<p>Alright gents, let's get into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior1"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 1. Listening To The Voices In Your Head</h2>
<p>Let's start this off with some statistics out of the National Science Foundation: The average person experiences between 12,000 and 60,000 thoughts a day. 85% of those thoughts are negative, and 95% are repeated from the previous day.</p>
<p>This sucks, right? But don't worry, science is on your side too.</p>
<div id="attachment_94728" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94728" class="wp-image-94728 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress.png" alt="man with stress levels" width="700" height="344" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress-300x147.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress-450x221.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94728" class="wp-caption-text">Bad thoughts often never come true, but thinking about them too often can cause undue stress.</p></div>
<p>Data from Cornell University reveals that 85% of those negative thoughts never come true. Even when they do, 79% of subjects admitted to handling them far better than they imagined.</p>
<p>What should you take away from all of this? That you shouldn't let those bad thoughts get to you. Statistically, we make things out to be worse than they actually are by thinking about them. At the end of the day, it's all just in your head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior2"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 2. Thinking You Need Washboard Abs</h2>
<p>One common self-destructive behavior in men is the belief that they need to fit an ideal image of fitness &#8211; the toned abs, the pecs, the biceps.</p>
<p>Evidence for this comes from a 2010 study out of the Journal of Psychology of Men & Masculinity. After surveying 202 College men, it turned out that their self-identity and relationships were influenced directly by their worries on body image.</p>
<div id="attachment_94722" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94722" class="wp-image-94722 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8.jpg" alt="man tired gym" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94722" class="wp-caption-text">Stop stressing over you have a model's body. Instead, focus on getting stronger.</p></div>
<p>My take on this? Looking like a hunk doesn't necessarily mean you have a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on achieving results. When you hit the gym, set your goals and do what you need to do to reach them &#8211; whether that be a new personal best on the bench or simply hitting the gym more often.</p>
<p>Were you able to get stronger? Did you manage to run longer? That's what matters, not so much how it's reflected on your body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior3"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 3. Not Developing A Ritual</h2>
<p>Do you sleep in every day? Do you often go days without shaving? What about neglecting your skin?</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of bad habits which become increasingly entrenched in your routine the longer that you let them go on for.</p>
<div id="attachment_87161" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.tiege.com/rmrsdestructive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-87161" class="wp-image-87161 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/tiege-hanley-mens-skin-care.jpg" alt="tiege hanley men's skin care" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/tiege-hanley-mens-skin-care.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/tiege-hanley-mens-skin-care-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/tiege-hanley-mens-skin-care-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-87161" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://www.tiege.com/rmrsdestructive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a ritual for your skin is essential. Click here to see how Tiege Hanley takes the hassle out of skin care.</a></p></div>
<p>Instead, develop <strong>rituals. </strong></p>
<p>A ritual consists of a series of actions performed according to a prescribed order. This is a way to introduce more structure to your day rather than sticking to bad habits.</p>
<p>The best part is that rituals can be applied to any aspect of your day. In many cases &#8211; such as for <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/best-mens-skincare-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skin care</a> and <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/simplify-shaving-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shaving</a> &#8211; it can make life much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior4"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 4. Taking Unnecessary Risks &#8211; &#8220;Hold My Beer&#8221;</h2>
<p>Did you know that the frontal lobe of our brains takes longer to develop than women? What does that mean?</p>
<p>Since the frontal lobe governs factors such as judgment, caution, and fear, it means that we're biologically more inclined than women to make bold decisions &#8211; often too bold.</p>
<div id="attachment_96041" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96041" class="wp-image-96041 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/frontal-lobe-diagram.jpg" alt="frontal lobe brain diagram" width="700" height="521" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/frontal-lobe-diagram.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/frontal-lobe-diagram-300x223.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/frontal-lobe-diagram-336x250.jpg 336w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96041" class="wp-caption-text">Men are naturally more likely to make stupid decisions. Sorry, fellas.</p></div>
<p>This is why all the idiotic drunk stories you hear usually involve men.</p>
<p>The solution? Take a step back and evaluate the merit of your risks a little better. Are you investing a moderate amount into the stock market or all your savings into a risky business?</p>
<p>Consider the return on every decision you make. Find a balance between risk and reward &#8211; you might be surprised at what you can accomplish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior5"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 5. Listening To Unsolicited Advice</h2>
<p>When it comes to self-destructive behaviors in men, we often never consider this one.</p>
<p>Who has your ear? Do you take advice from those closest to you, or from just anybody?</p>
<p>It's critical that you choose carefully who will act as your confidants. Need family advice? Consider asking that close friend who &#8211; though not financially successful &#8211; has an amazing relationship with his wife and kids.</p>
<div id="attachment_95479" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95479" class="wp-image-95479 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking.jpeg" alt="men at the table talking" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking-375x250.jpeg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95479" class="wp-caption-text">Only take advice from people that you hold to be trustworthy.</p></div>
<p>The bottom line here, gentlemen, is that you should keep a tight circle and consider carefully who you take advice from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior6"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 6. Comparing Yourself To Others</h2>
<p>It's pretty obvious why this is such a self-destructive behavior in men, but let's go into a little more detail.</p>
<p>Here are three reasons why social comparisons are a fallacy:</p>
<p><strong>Perfection is an illusion:</strong> The successes you see on social media don't comprise the whole story. A friend might post about their big house, but they might have serious personal issues. A family might seem happy in a photograph, but they may not be most of the time.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Avoid jealousy always &#8211; but especially when it comes to your friends</em></h4>
<p><strong>Life isn't fair:</strong> Some of us are just born to more disadvantages than others. There are men who are fortunate to have been born into a wealthy family with social connections, and those who have to work really hard. Unfortunately, that's the reality.</p>
<p><strong>Turning friends into enemies:</strong> Social comparisons foster jealous feelings, especially if your friends seem to be doing better than you. Be happy for your friends, not angry &#8211; your time will come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior7"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 7. Avoiding Doctors</h2>
<p>How long has it been since your last checkup?</p>
<p>According to some 2017 statistics out of Trinity Med, men are more likely than women to deliberately avoid going to see the doctor. 20% of those who did admitted to doing so just to get a loved one off their back.</p>
<div id="attachment_96119" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96119" class="wp-image-96119 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-visit-x-ray.jpeg" alt="doctor visit x ray" width="700" height="357" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-visit-x-ray.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-visit-x-ray-300x153.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doctor-visit-x-ray-450x230.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96119" class="wp-caption-text">Don't be stupid &#8211; don't put off doctor visits.</p></div>
<p>it all comes down to traditional views of masculinity. We like to think we're too tough or proud to see a doctor, so we ignore most of our problems.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you are not from Krypton. You will get sick, and you will get hurt. Set aside that pride and get your regular checkups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior8"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 8. Drinking Way Too Much</h2>
<p>It's time to get serious, gents. Some 2018 statistics revealed some alarming numbers.</p>
<p>23% of men reported binge drinking 5 times a month, with 8 drinks per binge. Approximately 8.4% of men met the medical criteria for alcohol dependence. Men are also roughly 50% more likely than women to be intoxicated.</p>
<div id="attachment_96044" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96044" class="wp-image-96044 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/party-time-alcohol-abuse.jpeg" alt="party time alcohol abuse" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/party-time-alcohol-abuse.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/party-time-alcohol-abuse-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/party-time-alcohol-abuse-376x250.jpeg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96044" class="wp-caption-text">Have a good time, but stay safe out there. Do not fall into the trap of alcohol abuse.</p></div>
<p>But why do we drink more? Guys metabolize alcohol faster thanks to an enzyme called Gastric Alcohol Dehydrogenase. This, paired with our natural urge toward risky behavior, makes for a potentially dangerous combination.</p>
<p>Remember that everything in moderation is key if you must drink at all. The maximum healthy and safe alcohol intake for men under 65 is two drinks &#8211; remember that, or avoid it altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior9"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 9. Eating Too Much Junk Food</h2>
<p>It's no secret that a bad diet can have adverse effects, but how does this concern men specifically?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, junk food can cause irreversible damage to the family jewels, and it can happen as early as age 20.</p>
<div id="attachment_91573" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91573" class="wp-image-91573 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pizza.jpg" alt="pizza in slices" width="700" height="360" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pizza.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pizza-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pizza-450x231.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-91573" class="wp-caption-text">Not only can a bad diet exacerbate body fat and greasy skin, but it can also permanently damage your sperm count.</p></div>
<p>The average, healthy sperm count should number about 39 million per ejaculate. This was found in test subjects who relied mainly on a balanced diet, but those who consumed fatty foods produced 25.6 million fewer sperm.</p>
<p>It is theorized that junk food amplifies oxidative stress, which in turn damages the cells which produce sperm.</p>
<p>Do you care about the boys below? Then watch what you eat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="behavior10"></a></p>
<h2>Destructive Behavior 10. Being Closed-Minded</h2>
<p>Many of us are so stubborn, we'd rather die than admit we were wrong and join the winning team.</p>
<p>This self-destructive behavior in men comes down to <strong>thinking critically. </strong>Though most guys will take their viewpoints to the grave, very few will take that extra step and ask that all-important question: <em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Constantly broaden your horizons</em></h4>
<p>It's very possible that some principles you have are either outdated or plain wrong. This doesn't mean you need to compromise your values, but you should always be assessing them while being inquisitive.</p>
<p>Perhaps your mind isn't changed, but make a point to explore the opposing philosophy to understand it better. You never know what you might learn in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myths. Mistruths. Fiction. Lies.</p>
<p>Call it what you want but gentlemen &#8211; but you're not being told the truth.</p>
<p>In fact &#8211; a lot of what you know about style is wrong.</p>
<p>With the growing trend of fashion experts who have their own ideas of what style is, there are a lot of style myths out there.</p>

<p>So let's begin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section1"></a></p>
<h2>Style Myth 1. Only Shallow Men Care About Style</h2>
<p>&#8220;People who care about their appearance are shallow.&#8221;</p>
<p>I've heard this so many times before.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, those men who don't take pride in their appearance are the first ones to accuse a well-dressed man of being shallow and materialistic.</p>
<p>There are shallow men who only care about what they wear and there are shallow men who turn their noses up at those who take pride in their appearance.</p>
<div id="attachment_96072" style="width: 704px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96072" class="wp-image-96072 size-full" title="style myths proved wrong" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/king-henry.jpg" alt="style myths proved wrong" width="694" height="715" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/king-henry.jpg 694w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/king-henry-291x300.jpg 291w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/king-henry-243x250.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96072" class="wp-caption-text">Throughout history, social status has been often associated with clothing.</p></div>
<p>If we look back through history, clothing has often been associated as a symbol of status in society.</p>
<p>Members of the aristocracy were distinguished from &#8220;commoners&#8221; by the clothes they wore.</p>
<p>In today's world &#8211; the situation is the same.</p>
<p>People judge you by the way you look and the clothes you wear. For that reason, gentlemen, you should always plan your outfits the day before and wear them with pride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section2"></a></p>
<h2>Style Myth 2. You Have To Be Rich To Dress Well</h2>
<p>This is a common excuse.</p>
<p>The reality couldn't be more different. It's easy to dress well when you're on a budget.</p>
<p>There are three simple priorities every man must adhere to when it comes to dressing well.</p>
<p>Introducing: The Style Pyramid.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fabric</strong></li>
<li><strong>Function</strong></li>
</ol>
<div id="attachment_91190" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91190" class="wp-image-91190 size-full" title="style myths proved wrong" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/style-pyramid-casual.jpg" alt="style myths proved wrong" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/style-pyramid-casual.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/style-pyramid-casual-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/style-pyramid-casual-444x250.jpg 444w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-91190" class="wp-caption-text">If you are familiar with my <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">style pyramid</a>, then you know where to start when you are looking for new outfits.</p></div>
<p>A great way to minimize expenditure when it comes to clothing is to ask a well-dressed friend if he can give you clothes he doesn't wear anymore.</p>
<p>You can also pick up some of the skills and do minor adjustments on your own and save money there.</p>
<p>Realize that patience is a big factor in this whole equation &#8211; all stores, even the high-end ones &#8211; have sales.</p>
<p>If you know what you want and you are confident in the quality of a certain store, wait until the items you need are on sale and grab them for a fraction of their normal price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section3"></a></p>
<h2>Style Myth 3. Style Is Complicated</h2>
<p>For a timeless look, look to history for inspiration.</p>
<p>The most important thing to ask yourself is &#8220;what type of message do I want to send the world?&#8221;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Great style isn't about making a thousand choices. It's about making a few choices for you.</h4>
<p>You can always look at some of the style icons throughout the years and take inspiration from them.</p>
<div id="attachment_49890" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49890" class="wp-image-49890 size-full" title="style myths proved wrong" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/James-Dean-Rebel-Without-a-Cause-800x1135-e1537216427833.jpg" alt="style myths proved wrong" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/James-Dean-Rebel-Without-a-Cause-800x1135-e1537216427833.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/James-Dean-Rebel-Without-a-Cause-800x1135-e1537216427833-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/James-Dean-Rebel-Without-a-Cause-800x1135-e1537216427833-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-49890" class="wp-caption-text">Take inspiration from style icons like James Dean.</p></div>
<p>Later on, <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when you have enough confidence</a> to bring something new into your outfit, go for it.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to experiment. With every outfit you put on, you will see ways to improve both yourself and your wardrobe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section4"></a></p>
<h2>Style Myth 4. Quality Clothing Costs More</h2>
<p>With the rise of fast fashion brands and trendy pieces, people often make the mistake of buying clothes they don't like &#8211; but feel obliged to buy.</p>
<h3>The most expensive clothing you own is the clothing you don't wear.</h3>
<p>Quality clothing costs you more but you need to realize it is the number of times that you wear a certain piece that determines it's actual value.</p>
<div id="attachment_92431" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92431" class="wp-image-92431 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Style-Theory-of-Value-e1555715599457.jpg" alt="stye theory of value" width="700" height="327" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-92431" class="wp-caption-text">The <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Style Theory of Value</a> is a simple equation that helps you determine the actual value of clothing.</p></div>
<p>Picture it like this; if you buy one quality sweater and wear it for a decade, it actually comes off cheaper than multiple low-quality sweaters you buy over the years.</p>
<p>Realize that it is the durability of your clothing that matters and you will quickly understand that in the long term it is smarter to invest in quality clothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="section5"></a></p>
<h2>Style Myth 5. A Man Should Spend Less On Clothes Than A Woman</h2>
<p>The women's fashion industry is more popular than the men's but this is no excuse to spend less on clothing.</p>
<p>This is a myth we've all heard time and time again.</p>
<p>If you are an up and coming businessman who already has some success in his life, then you can spend as much as you want on your image.</p>
<p>It is your image, along with your knowledge, that will ultimately help you rake in more business and have opportunities knock on your door.</p>
<div id="attachment_95594" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95594" class="wp-image-95594 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2.jpg" alt="man with a lot of shopping bags" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95594" class="wp-caption-text">Remember that you can spend as much money as you want on your clothes.</p></div>
<p>The key, gentlemen, is in knowing what your goal is.</p>
<p>Once you realize what type of message you want to send, <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-clothing-flexibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start building an interchangeable wardrobe</a> that will serve your purpose.</p>
<p>That way, not only will your closet look better, but you will be able to pair everything you own and be prepared for any circumstance that comes your way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. Your Phone</h2>
<p>Mobile phones have slowly integrated into our daily lives.</p>
<p>While they are essential for communication, they also play a huge part in most peoples workdays.</p>
<p>But phones put a ton of stress on our productivity, simply due to the number of distractions they carry.</p>
<p>Calling and texting is one thing, but it gets even worse with social media.</p>
<p>These kinds of apps can be addicting because they feed our tendency to socialize and keep up with people.</p>
<p>These apps are a major source of distractions, and they know it! They will constantly remind you of various things at all hours of the day.</p>
<p>These distractions can include ring tones, notifications and even LED indicators that blink in bright colors.</p>
<div id="attachment_95902" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95902" class="wp-image-95902 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-looking-at-phone-1.jpg" alt="man looking at phone" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-looking-at-phone-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-looking-at-phone-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-looking-at-phone-1-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95902" class="wp-caption-text">Do you catch yourself checking your phone too often?</p></div>
<p>All of this can be overwhelming, and when you add to the fact that most of it is not important, the problem becomes obvious.</p>
<p>Here are some tips on how you can deal with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary apps from your home screen.</li>
<li>Disable notifications on apps that don't contribute to your work.</li>
<li>Get a proper alarm clock &#8211; If you use your phone, make use of the &#8220;Airplane Mode&#8221; or &#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; options.</li>
<li>When charging your phone, put it out of reach as you'll end up forgetting about it until you absolutely need it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. Time Wasters</h2>
<p>&#8220;Time Wasters&#8221; can be summarized as things &#8211; and sometimes people &#8211; that require a lot of attention, but provide little or no return.</p>
<p>These are things that &#8211; no matter how annoying &#8211; simply aren't high on the priority matrix.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/eisenhower-matrix-pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">priority matrix</a> is an effective and simple way to break down the importance of tasks.</p>
<div id="attachment_95915" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95915" class="wp-image-95915 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/priority-matrix-1.jpg" alt="eisenhower priority matrix" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/priority-matrix-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/priority-matrix-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/priority-matrix-1-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95915" class="wp-caption-text">The Eisenhower Task Priority Matrix</p></div>
<p>So the next time you know you have a bunch of stuff to do, try organizing it all with this simple method &#8211; and you'll increase productivity on all of them.</p>
<p>Simply put, getting what's important done first releases the pressure. This leaves you with a good overall idea of how much time you can spend on other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="cigarettesandcoffee"></a></p>
<h2>3. Cigarettes and Coffee</h2>
<p>Nicotine and caffeine are part of many people's daily lives.</p>
<p>The average smoker in America takes in 15 cigarettes a day.</p>
<p>Combine the time it takes to smoke one cigarette and the time it takes to find a smoking area, and you'll find that hours of your day will be spent on this habit alone.</p>
<p>While it's hard to flat out ask you to just stop smoking, I strongly suggest doing a breathing exercise instead.</p>
<p>This will help you to battle the desire to smoke and help you to focus on getting your work done, and thus increase productivity.</p>
<div id="attachment_95904" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95904" class="wp-image-95904 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/drinking-coffee.jpg" alt="drinking pouring coffee" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/drinking-coffee.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/drinking-coffee-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/drinking-coffee-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95904" class="wp-caption-text">The average consumer of coffee in the U.S. drinks over 3 cups per day.</p></div>
<p>Coffee shops are a multi-billion dollar business. Over 50% of Americans report they drink it every day.</p>
<p>Women report they consume coffee as a relaxing, socializing opportunity. Men mostly drink coffee as preparation for work.</p>
<p>For lots of men, coffee becomes an addiction, and without your morning coffee, you feel like you can't get much work done.</p>
<p>To battle needlessly drinking coffee, drink as much water as you can. Being thirsty is the main drive that leads us to drink any beverage.</p>
<p>Not only will this help you overcome your addiction, but by balancing out how much coffee you drink, you will be able to push through the need to drink coffee and be more productive.</p>

<h2>4. Sugar and Snacks</h2>
<p>There's no doubt the U.S. has a problem with obesity &#8211; there are many factors in that equation, but sugar plays a major role.</p>
<p>Many people complete a meal with a dose of sugar, that's why desert exists. What most of them don't know is how much sugar is in the snacks they eat.</p>
<p>Snacking can be a distraction in itself because you're not focused &#8211; your hand is jumping around from the task to snacks.</p>
<p>You also risk spilling something and making a mess, and the noise you create can annoy you and your coworkers.</p>
<p>This is why most offices have a &#8220;no eating at the work station&#8221; rule, to reduce distractions and increase productivity.</p>
<div id="attachment_95911" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95911" class="wp-image-95911 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit.jpg" alt="different types of fruit" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/fruit-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95911" class="wp-caption-text">If you find it difficult to put down snacks altogether, try some fresh fruit instead.</p></div>
<p>To minimize the need for sugar and snacks, make sure to eat regularly and drink plenty of water.</p>
<p>Along with coffee and cigarettes, these addictions are not only time consuming, but also distracting as they can cause unease until the craving is fed, lowering your productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="overthinking"></a></p>
<h2>5. Overthinking</h2>
<p>A huge cause of daily distraction is spending a lot of time overthinking.</p>
<p>It's one thing to put too much focus on a first date, but what I'm talking about is the practice of fact-checking things, even when we're sure of something.</p>
<p>The internet has given us unlimited resources on demand, but it also created a culture of searching for everything and anything.</p>
<p>This creates doubt in people and forces them to search for things, just to confirm what they already know.</p>
<p>While being absolutely sure of something isn't a bad thing, fact-checking everything does not mean you will be more productive.</p>
<div id="attachment_95906" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://skl.sh/rmrs11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95906" class="wp-image-95906 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nervous-man-overthinking.jpg" alt="nervous man overthinking" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nervous-man-overthinking.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nervous-man-overthinking-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nervous-man-overthinking-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95906" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://skl.sh/rmrs11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finding the correct information can be hard &#8211; but places like Skillshare make our lives easier. Click here to learn more and get a great discount!</a></p></div>
<p>But even this is just part of the problem. The average person &#8211; searching for an answer to a question &#8211; will open multiple sources only to read the same thing, written in a different way.</p>
<p>Also, searching for one simple answer can often lead to lots of pointless web browsing.</p>
<p>The amount of ads and suggested links popping up doesn't help us here either.</p>
<p>So, if you need to search for something, find a credible source that will become your go-to, instead of using search engines. This will help you to narrow your focus, and reduce the time you spend on useless browsing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="videogames"></a></p>
<h2>6. Video games</h2>
<p>There are countless arguments on both the positives and negatives of playing games, but there's no doubt they can become addicting.</p>
<p>Question is, do you play video games in your spare time, or do you neglect other things to play the game?</p>
<p>A study by Brigham Young University suggests playing games can boost creativity, improve decisions making and increase productivity in office life.</p>
<p>However, the real culprits of this addiction are small, mobile-friendly video games. Those that offer no results other than virtual achievements and short term satisfaction.</p>
<h4>As many as 70% of Americans play video games. Around 60% are male and 40% are female.</h4>
<p>Most of them are packed with addicting features that give you the incentive to play them on a frequent basis.</p>
<p>These are masked as rewards for playing at a specific time or for a certain amount of hours and so on.</p>
<p>They send notifications such as &#8220;You haven't played for <em>X</em> amount of days&#8221; or &#8220;<em>X</em> person has earned a certain achievement&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the best-case scenario, they are just annoying. But in the worst cases, they force you to spend countless amounts of time and money.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is to avoid these altogether and find a different source of entertainment, which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>7. The News</h2>
<p>Reading the news is a very popular way of passing time. You'll notice a lot of people are doing it.</p>
<p>An unmeasurable amount of time each day is spent on reading news that has no benefit or just isn't factual.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most news sources are interested in clicks more than the quality of their content &#8211; that's why they rely on &#8220;clickbait&#8221;.</p>
<p>By using shock factors they make users think &#8220;I've got to see this&#8221;. What often follows is a story that's either overdramatized or underwhelming.</p>
<p>The media knows dramatic stories attract a lot of attention. That's why a big portion of the top news stories are negative.</p>
<div id="attachment_95908" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95908" class="wp-image-95908 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-reading-a-newspaper.jpg" alt="man reading a news paper" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-reading-a-newspaper.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-reading-a-newspaper-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-reading-a-newspaper-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95908" class="wp-caption-text">While many people start their day off with reading the news, be careful not to douse yourself with negativity first thing in the morning.</p></div>
<p>Now I'm not saying that you should cut yourself off from the world, reading news is a good way to keep up to date.</p>
<p>It's just that you've got to be careful which news sources you trust.</p>
<p>The best idea is to pick the one you will follow, instead of relying on browsing. Alternatively, you can pay someone to scour headlines for you and send you daily updates with the most important stories.</p>
<p>This will help you to focus your attention only on the things that matter, and keep you from losing track of your time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="meetings"></a></p>
<h2>8. Unnecessary Meetings</h2>
<p>It's hard to tell which meetings are important, and which waste everybody's time.</p>
<p>Attending meetings that hold no value to you can be as bad as doing nothing.</p>
<p>While you may find many coworkers enjoying them and treating them as &#8220;extended breaks&#8221;, they're wasting your time in the long run.</p>
<p>Which would you rather do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to work, attend a two-hour meeting on something you already know, return to finish up for the day and leave.</li>
<li>Go to work, finish 2 hours early and go home for the day, or use the time to catch up on other projects.
<p><div id="attachment_95909" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95909" class="wp-image-95909 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-thinking-at-a-meeting.jpg" alt="man thinking at a meeting" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-thinking-at-a-meeting.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-thinking-at-a-meeting-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-thinking-at-a-meeting-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95909" class="wp-caption-text">If all you can think about are your unfinished tasks, this meeting is just a distraction.</p></div></li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you have things to do and deadlines to stick to, the meeting may either be postponed or skipped altogether.</p>
<p>So bring it up to your manager, they will appreciate your honesty and initiative, but make sure you're explaining why you think the meeting is not helpful &#8211; otherwise you risk consequences for trying to get out of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="innervoice"></a></p>
<h2>9. Your Inner Voice</h2>
<p>You know that inner alter ego talking to you, with whom you have conversations long into the night?</p>
<p>No, that's not what I'm talking about, do you think I'm crazy?</p>
<p>Who knows, but what I am talking about are the voices of self-doubt.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;I can't do this.&#8221;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;There's not enough time.&#8221;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;I'm the only one making an effort.&#8221;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These thoughts go through our heads more than we like to admit.</p>
<div id="attachment_95910" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95910" class="wp-image-95910 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-pointing-at-head.jpg" alt="man pointing at head smiling" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-pointing-at-head.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-pointing-at-head-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/man-pointing-at-head-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95910" class="wp-caption-text">It's all in your head.</p></div>
<p>The way to eliminate them is stopping for a second to rethink.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a short break</li>
<li>Go for a walk</li>
<li>Do some quick exercises</li>
<li>Practice breathing techniques</li>
<li>Meditate</li>
</ul>
<p>This should not take more than a couple of minutes but will help to refresh your energy and regain focus.</p>
<p>What follows is that rush of energy and boost of confidence that will make you crush any obstacle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="hungerpangs"></a></p>
<h2>10. Hunger Pangs</h2>
<p>Feeling hungry is the most natural daily distraction everyone faces. This is something you can't automate or ignore.</p>
<p>Most people have a tendency to eat only when they feel hungry, and often at specific times.</p>
<p>But that feeling is often just the beginning. What follows is feeling tired due to a lack of energy.</p>
<p>You get anxious to get things done &#8211; or go eat &#8211; and thinking about which to do first saps your energy even more.</p>
<p>So you either speed through a task, leave it and lose momentum, or compensate by snacking.</p>
<div id="attachment_95912" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95912" class="wp-image-95912 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vegerables.jpg" alt="different types of vegetables" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vegerables.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vegerables-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vegerables-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95912" class="wp-caption-text">When you eat is equally as important as what and how much you eat.</p></div>
<p>To beat this distraction, plan out a daily eating routine. That way your body can get used to when and how much you eat and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many meals you eat per day, what matters is consistency, and consistency will help you to be more productive.</p>

<p>Next time you're sitting outside, take a look around you.</p>

</ol>
<p>Alright gentlemen, let's get started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="style1"></a></p>
<h2>Summer Style Mistake 1. The Baseball Cap</h2>
<p>With the sun shining high up in the sky, you're going to need a hat. What men's summer style mistake should you steer clear from first and foremost?</p>
<p>That <strong>ratty baseball cap. </strong></p>
<p>Whether it's a sports team or a symbol from your favorite movie, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't use it.</p>
<p>For one thing, old baseball caps will make you look like trailer trash.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not flattering.</p>
<p>If you're hitting up a game or actually playing in one, make sure your cap is clean and fresh for wear.</p>
<div id="attachment_93726" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/9-classic-hat-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93726" class="wp-image-93726 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama.jpg" alt="straw panama hat" width="700" height="488" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/travis-straw-panama-359x250.jpg 359w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-93726" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/9-classic-hat-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out classic hat styles for the modern man.</a></p></div>
<p>If sports aren't in the schedule, bring in some <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/9-classic-hat-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic hat styles</a>. Get yourself a <strong>straw fedora</strong>. These can take your style up a notch regardless of your outfit, adding a little elegance with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>Already experienced with the fedora? Step it up to a <strong>Panama Hat</strong>. While fedoras are more common, Panama Hats sport wider brims and thus require a confident man to wear them.</p>
<p>Quality varies wildly in stylish straw hats. Most products claiming such are actually made with refined paper. Erring on the side of cheap may be ideal if you experience all four seasons, but those in perpetually hot climates should consider higher-end hats that last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="style2"></a></p>
<h2>Summer Style Mistake 2. Too Much Hair Product</h2>
<p>Let's face it; When it comes to hair gel, some guys take it too far.</p>
<p>Thick hair products can mix with your sweat while you're outside and before you know it, your face and eyes are covered in chemicals and it starts burning.</p>
<p>It all sounds pretty unpleasant, doesn't it?</p>
<div id="attachment_95798" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/hair-products-men-vdo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95798" class="wp-image-95798 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hair-gel-mens-summer-style-mistakes.jpg" alt="Man applying hair mousse" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hair-gel-mens-summer-style-mistakes.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hair-gel-mens-summer-style-mistakes-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hair-gel-mens-summer-style-mistakes-445x250.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95798" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/hair-products-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking of hair products, click here to see which product suits your style the best.</a></p></div>
<p>&#8220;Antonio, my hair is a mess. I NEED a product in it.&#8221; I hear you, most guys do.</p>
<p>This is why I recommend trying <strong>fiber or clay</strong>. These kinds of products are going to stick directly to your hair rather than linger on the scalp.</p>
<p>You can also run your hands through without picking up a ton of grease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="style3"></a></p>
<h2>Summer Style Mistake 3. Using Lined Jackets</h2>
<p>Are all sport coats and suit jackets made the same? Absolutely not. When it comes to men's summer style mistakes, this can be an easy one to fall for.</p>
<p>Most men's jackets you'll find will have a lining &#8211; <strong>polyester</strong> if it's cheap.</p>
<p>This can be troublesome in the heat. Imagine covering yourself in a garbage bag and baking under the suit &#8211; that's what it'll feel like.</p>

<p>For the summer, <strong>you're going to need jackets lined with Bemberg</strong>. It's a less expensive alternative to silk made from wood pulp. It's nevertheless high-quality and breathable.</p>
<p>An even more comfortable (But more expensive) choice would be an <strong>unlined jacket</strong>.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, unlined jackets cost far more to manufacture because they need to showcase more detail than they would if they were lined. Regardless, it's a sound investment for a go-to sport coat during the summer.

<h2>Summer Style Mistake 4. Wearing Jeans</h2>
<p>That's right, I said it.</p>
<p>I know this is going to annoy a lot of you guys but jeans are impractical for the summer.</p>
<p>It's a men's summer style mistake we all make &#8211; Heck, I'm even guilty of it.</p>
<p>It's not ideal because <strong>denim usually comes in a very tight and thick weave</strong>. This means the fabric isn't breathable, and that means your legs are going to become a sauna.</p>
<div id="attachment_95804" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/men-wear-skinny-jeans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95804" class="wp-image-95804 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jeans-mens-summer-style-mistakes.jpeg" alt="mens jeans of three different colors" width="700" height="560" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jeans-mens-summer-style-mistakes.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jeans-mens-summer-style-mistakes-300x240.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jeans-mens-summer-style-mistakes-313x250.jpeg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95804" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/men-wear-skinny-jeans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another pet peeve of mine? Skinny jeans. Click here to see why you should never wear them.</a></p></div>
<p>What can you use as an alternative?</p>
<p>I'm an advocate for<strong> tropical weight wool trousers</strong>. They're made with much lighter wool and can sometimes produce a silky texture. It's light, stylish, and practical &#8211; you don't need anything else! They're perfect for the workplace.</p>
<p>A more casual alternative would be <strong>linen trousers</strong>. For centuries, linen has been a luxury fabric in hot climates. This is as breathable as you're going to get, but they are prone to wrinkles. Linen trousers are also a fundamentally casual garment, even suited for the beach!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="style5"></a></p>
<h2>Summer Style Mistake 5. Sandals, Socks & Crocs</h2>
<p>Now, I understand why sandals would be appropriate in certain summertime occasions. If you're poolside or at the beach, it's certainly feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Crocs, on the other hand, never look good. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Long gym socks</strong> are also a bad idea. In the summer heat, it's obvious as to why their thickness and length make them a liability.</p>
<p>So, what is a fella to do?</p>
<p>Summer is the perfect time to upgrade your shoe game to men's loafers. These casual dress shoes are perfect for summer because of how light and open they are.</p>
<p>Loafers go best with no-show socks, which allow them to be less cumbersome while giving your feet room to breath.</p>
<div id="attachment_89084" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/monk-straps-vs-penny-loafers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89084" class="wp-image-89084 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/rhone-commuter-pants.jpg" alt="man wearing loafer summer shoes" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/rhone-commuter-pants.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/rhone-commuter-pants-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/rhone-commuter-pants-350x250.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-89084" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/monk-straps-vs-penny-loafers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Men's loafers make the perfect shoe for the summer. Click here to see how they stand up against monk straps.</a></p></div>
<p>These shoes go well with any casual outfit, be it shorts or a full-on summer suit. Gents, I cannot recommend loafers enough.</p>

</ol>
<p>Alright gentlemen, let's get started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="loaf1"></a></p>
<h2>1. The Basics &#8211; Defining a Men's Loafer</h2>
<p>Before we go in deep, we need to know what we're dealing with. So, what is a men's loafer?</p>
<p>Loafers are a kind of dress shoe that easily slip on and off your foot. They have broad, flat heels and are made with leather. They also use no laces or buckles, since that would defeat the purpose of a loafer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>General History</h3>
<p>Loafers have a fascinating story. They were born out of combining traditional Native American moccasins and Norwegian peasant slippers. The first company to produce traditional loafers was G.H. Bass, a brand that had been around since 1876.</p>
<p>George Henry Bass &#8211; its founder &#8211; released them in 1936 as &#8220;Weejuns,&#8221; a play on &#8220;Norwegian&#8221; to denote their cultural heritage.</p>
<div id="attachment_95767" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95767" class="wp-image-95767 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafer-weejuns.jpg" alt="mens loafer weejuns" width="700" height="689" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafer-weejuns.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafer-weejuns-300x295.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafer-weejuns-254x250.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95767" class="wp-caption-text">The Weejuns in this 1965 advertisement serve as proof that men's loafers haven't changed.</p></div>
<p>The shoe took off in the United States. It was adopted swiftly by Ivy League students, who dubbed them &#8220;Penny Loafers&#8221; due to the fact they slipped a penny into the seam on the shoe's Upper to be used for pay phones.</p>
<p>The style of men's loafers hasn't changed much since the very first Weejuns, setting them apart as a timeless classic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="loaf2"></a></p>
<h2>2. Which Men's Loafer Is Right For You?</h2>
<p>Over the years, several variations of the loafer evolved to accommodate men with various tastes.</p>
<p>Which can work for you?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>all of them. </strong></p>
<p>Why? Loafers are all casual dress shoes. They are meant to be worn in in a similar context to dress boots &#8211; smart, but casual. No matter the variant, they all serve the same purpose &#8211; have at it, gents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Wildsmith Loafer</h3>
<p>The Wildsmiths have been around since 1926 when the company &#8211; originally specializing in army cavalry boots &#8211; designed a house shoe for King George VI.</p>
<p>The King wanted a pair of casual, yet elegant shoes he could wear on his property for activities like shooting.</p>
<div id="attachment_95769" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95769" class="wp-image-95769 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafers-wildsmiths.jpg" alt="mens loafers wildsmiths" width="700" height="483" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafers-wildsmiths.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafers-wildsmiths-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mens-loafers-wildsmiths-362x250.jpg 362w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95769" class="wp-caption-text">Wildsmith loafers have a narrower silhouette than other variants.</p></div>
<p>How is the Wildsmith different? It uses a serrated seam with vertical stitching over the toe. This gives the shoe a more sleek and elegant look.</p>
<p>Though they aren't considered the first official men's loafers to be released, they certainly fit the bill now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Aurland Loafers</h3>
<p>Like the original Weejuns, Aurland men's loafers came into prominence in the 1930s. It takes inspiration a little more directly from traditional moccasins.</p>
<div id="attachment_95770" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95770" class="wp-image-95770 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/urland-mens-loafers.jpg" alt="Aurland mens loafers" width="700" height="358" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/urland-mens-loafers.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/urland-mens-loafers-300x153.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/urland-mens-loafers-450x230.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95770" class="wp-caption-text">The Aurland loafers have a more robust look to them.</p></div>
<p>Like its progenitor, the Aurland has a raised seam to give it a more boxy look as well as a narrow cut over the saddle of the shoe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tassel Loafers</h3>
<p>These loafers exploded in the US following World War II. So much so, that they became a favorite of President Harry Truman.</p>
<p>Here is where cultures start to clash. Americans tend to consider the tasseled men's loafer to be capable of holding its own in black-tie situations. However, the British sneer against this.</p>
<div id="attachment_95771" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95771" class="wp-image-95771 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tassel-loafers-brown.jpg" alt="tassel loafers brown" width="700" height="391" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tassel-loafers-brown.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tassel-loafers-brown-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tassel-loafers-brown-448x250.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95771" class="wp-caption-text">Many of us Americans see the tasseled loafer as a formal shoe &#8211; it's not.</p></div>
<p>My recommendation is to err on the side of casual. it's much more suited for a night out with friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Kilted Loafers</h3>
<p>Though they fell out of style in the 70s, &#8220;Kilties&#8221; are seeing a resurgence in classic menswear. Their unique look is inspired by Oxford brogues and Scottish golf shoes.</p>
<div id="attachment_95773" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95773" class="wp-image-95773 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiltie-loafers.jpg" alt="kiltie loafers" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiltie-loafers.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiltie-loafers-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiltie-loafers-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiltie-loafers-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95773" class="wp-caption-text">Kilted loafers take inspiration from classic Oxford shoes. See the resemblance?</p></div>
<p>These are definitely suited for a day of lounging at the country club.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Horsebit Loafers</h3>
<p>Italian designer Aldo Gucci debuted these stunning men's loafers in 1943.</p>
<p>There are a few key differences between these and other loafers. For one thing, Gucci was the first to design loafers in black. More importantly, he added a metal horsebit over where the penny keeper would have been.</p>
<div id="attachment_95774" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://jaybutler.com/?utm_source=Real-men-real-style&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=5-ways-to-wear-loafers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95774" class="wp-image-95774 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jay-butler-penny-loafers.jpg" alt="jay butler men's loafers" width="700" height="351" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jay-butler-penny-loafers.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jay-butler-penny-loafers-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jay-butler-penny-loafers-450x226.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95774" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://jaybutler.com/?utm_source=Real-men-real-style&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=5-ways-to-wear-loafers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's clear that Justin Jeffers used horsebit loafers as his inspiration. Click here to get a pair at Jay Butler.</a></p></div>
<p>For these reasons, horsebit loafers are considered a little more elegant than their counterparts. While still a fundamentally casual dress show, it can serve you well if your office dress code is business casual and it's the summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Belgian Loafers</h3>
<p>Last, but not least &#8211; we have the Belgians.</p>
<p>In 1954, Henri Bendel purchased two 300-year-old factories in Belgium. His contribution to the world was a men's loafer with a small bow sewn into the top.</p>
<div id="attachment_95776" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95776" class="wp-image-95776 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers.jpg" alt="belgian men's loafers" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/belgian-mens-loafers-445x250.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95776" class="wp-caption-text">There's no question why Belgian loafers took off. Just look at them!</p></div>
<p>It became an instant hit. Bendel's shoe single-handedly saved the Belgian shoe industry. He was awarded two Knighthoods for the deed: The Knightship of The Order of Leopold I in 1964, and Knight Commander of The Order of Leopold II six years later.</p>

<h2>3. Why Men's Loafers Are The Best Summer Shoes</h2>
<p>As we close into the height of summer, high tops and dress boots become increasingly impractical. Sure they look cool but covering your ankles in leather is guaranteed to make you hate being outside.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, loafers fulfill a similar role in outfits as do dress boots, in that they make an otherwise-casual look more elegant.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Lightweight and easygoing, the loafer is the perfect summer shoe</em></h4>
<p>if you wear no-show socks (you should), then loafers give your ankles and feet more breathing room. In addition to that, they are far lighter than other shoe types &#8211; making them less cumbersome in the heat.</p>
<p>Men's loafers are also the best kind of shoe to try new, summery colors with. Take a risk with powder blue, green and red suede, or burgundy.</p>
<p>Needed a shoe you can take risks with? Look no further.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Men's sunglasses &#8211; I've talked about them a lot here on RMRS.</p>
<p>We know that the right pair of Sunglasses are not only a practical accoutrement to a man's arsenal but a potentially stylish one as well.</p>
<p>Today though, we're doing things a little different. Instead of a general guide, we're reviewing a specific brand of men's sunglasses that recently launched.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95731" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enemy_Sunglasses_Review-700x400.jpg" alt="aaron marino sunglasses review" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enemy_Sunglasses_Review-700x400.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enemy_Sunglasses_Review-700x400-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Enemy_Sunglasses_Review-700x400-438x250.jpg 438w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The brand's name? <strong>Enemy Eyewear</strong></p>
<p>Now, full disclaimer here: This company was started by my good friend Aaron Marino. For this reason, this review won't be the most unbiased out there.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I'll still do my best to deliver a solid and fair assessment of this new entry into men's eyewear.</p>

</ol>
<p><a name="glasses1"></a></p>
<p>Alright gentlemen, let's get started.</p>
<h2>1. Enemy &#8211; Materials Overview</h2>
<p>Let's talk materials first. A common material used in quality glasses is <strong>acetate.</strong></p>
<p>What is this? Acetate is a synthetic filament derived from plant fibers. It's great for glasses because it's naturally durable and less likely to cause skin irritation.</p>
<div id="attachment_95692" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://enemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95692" class="wp-image-95692 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses-instagram.jpg" alt="enemy 3 mens sunglasses instagram" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses-instagram.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses-instagram-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses-instagram-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses-instagram-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95692" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://enemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There's no question that the materials in each pair of Enemy sunglasses are of the highest quality. Click here to check them out.</a></p></div>
<p>Enemy men's sunglasses are proud of their acetate, which they get from a manufacturer called Mazzucchelli 1849 in Italy.</p>
<p>In addition to that, they use <strong>stainless steel</strong> for the hinges which make them tougher overall.</p>
<p>What really impresses me are the lenses themselves, which are made with <strong>Zeiss</strong>. This material is usually reserved for the highest-quality cameras and provides 100% UVB protection with greater scratch resistance.</p>
<p>Materials? Check &#8211; no complaints here.</p>
<p><a name="glasses2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. The Designs</h2>
<p>Enemy men's sunglasses come in three designs with two colors (black and tortoise) each. This amounts to a total of six choices.</p>
<p>Let's go through them!</p>
<h3>Enemy 1 Wayfarers</h3>
<p>I have to admit &#8211; wayfarers are not my usual style. I just don't feel like I can pull them off and they rarely fit me right. This isn't the case for the Enemy 1's. A perfect fit means that they've become an addition to my rotation. Measurements for these come in 52 mm on the lens, 19 mm on the bridge of the nose, and 145 mm on temple length.</p>
<div id="attachment_95694" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95694" class="wp-image-95694 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-1-mens-sunglasses.jpg" alt="enemy 1 mens sunglasses" width="700" height="419" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-1-mens-sunglasses.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-1-mens-sunglasses-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-1-mens-sunglasses-418x250.jpg 418w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95694" class="wp-caption-text">These wayfarers fit me as no wayfarers have before.</p></div>
<h3>Enemy 2 Clubmasters</h3>
<p>The Enemy 2's are essentially <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/how-to-buy-sunglasses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic Clubmaster sunglasses</a>. The structure is especially important for these glasses because they come with more attached parts. As I handled it, I noticed the integrity was good &#8211; no loose screws.</p>
<div id="attachment_95697" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95697" class="wp-image-95697 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-2-mens-sunglasses.jpg" alt="enemy 2 mens sunglasses" width="700" height="436" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-2-mens-sunglasses.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-2-mens-sunglasses-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-2-mens-sunglasses-401x250.jpg 401w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95697" class="wp-caption-text">The Enemy 2's yield a solid structure which I recommend to any man.</p></div>
<p>I also noticed that the nose piece uses quality silicone which kept it from sliding down my nose. If you're looking for great Clubmasters, this is where you can get them. They come in measuring at 51 mm at the lens, 18 mm on the bridge, and 145 mm temple length.</p>
<h3>Enemy 3 Aviators</h3>
<p>Aviators are among my favorites when it comes to men's sunglasses. They have a history that sets them apart &#8211; having been designed in 1936 for fighter pilots. Slowly, they found their way to the civilian market as a staple of classic menswear.</p>
<div id="attachment_95699" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95699" class="wp-image-95699 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses.jpg" alt="enemy 3 mens sunglasses" width="700" height="408" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-3-mens-sunglasses-429x250.jpg 429w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95699" class="wp-caption-text">The Enemy 3 Aviators can fit any man's face shape.</p></div>
<p>Again, Enemy executes this design well overall. This round design features a gold frame, a double-bridged frame, and a very lightweight build. The result is a pair of sunglasses that make you feel as though they're barely there.</p>
<p><a name="glasses3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. The Price Point</h2>
<p>What really blows me away about Aaron Marino's glasses is the cost, especially against other high-end men's sunglasses.</p>
<p>Despite the quality, you can get them for <strong>$95!</strong></p>
<p>That's insane! But how do they compare against my go-to brand, Maui Jim?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Men's sunglasses from Enemy are more than a match for older brands.</em></h4>
<p>Maui's are three times more expensive than Enemy &#8211; retailing at around $300. They often boast titanium frames with Polarized2 technology. Despite all these factors gentlemen, the sheer quality Enemy brings to the table equals that of Maui &#8211; an older and established brand!</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on how they hold up against Ray Bans &#8211; Enemy exceeds them on all fronts.</p>
<p><a name="glasses4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. The Shortcomings</h2>
<p>Alright gents, you've heard me praise my friend's company &#8211; big surprise, right? Believe it or not, however, there is plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the case. Enemy sunglasses arrive in an attractive hard case &#8211; it's just too big. If you keep your glasses inside, you can hear them clattering inside even with the cleaning cloth to muffle it. It could do with a 25% reduction in size.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about the information offered on the site. If we look at names such as Maui Jim, we get all sorts of diagrams that highlight various stats for each category. While the three basic measurements for the lenses, ridge, and temple are useful, other brands will delve even further to cover the base curve and height.</p>
<div id="attachment_95704" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95704" class="wp-image-95704 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-mens-sunglasses-case.jpg" alt="enemy mens sunglasses case" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-mens-sunglasses-case.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-mens-sunglasses-case-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-mens-sunglasses-case-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/enemy-mens-sunglasses-case-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95704" class="wp-caption-text">Though I love the design for Enemy's case, it's far too bulky.</p></div>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the glasses themselves. Sure, the product is superb but I'm still inclined slightly toward my Maui Jims.</p>
<p>Why? They simply match my style better. The Enemy 3's for instance use very round lenses, but I prefer my Aviators to be a little more slender.</p>
<p>The variety is also lacking in comparison to Ray Bans or Mau Jims. A total of six to choose from is good, but it can start to feel dull after a while. I would have loved those Aviators to be in a silver frame!</p>
<p>Another small gripe I have is about the brand itself. It's a badass name, so it needs to be better represented. I'd love for them to print &#8220;Enemy&#8221; on the frames!</p>
<p><a name="glasses5"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. The Verdict</h2>
<p>My gripes are mainly based on personal preference. When we get down to the nitty-gritty of price and quality, Enemy Eyewear gets a <strong>9/10</strong> in my book.</p>
<p>I highly recommend them, gents. The substance you'll be getting for $95 cannot be understated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary &#8211; Enemy Men's Sunglasses</h2>

<p>Enemy Sunglasses are a fantastic new brand from my good friend Aaron Marino. They can hold their own against big brands when it comes to quality. With some finetuning and variation in products, I can see them dominating the market!</p>

<h2>The History Of Canvas Sneakers</h2>
<p>Canvas is a woven fabric made from cotton or linen and has been used to make shoes for a long time.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, a company called U.S. Rubber Company made the first mass-produced sneakers known as &#8220;Keds&#8221;.</p>
<p>They consisted of a canvas structure glued on top of a rubber sole.</p>
<p>Noticeably, they did not feature a left and right foot, but a universal shoe made to fit all feet.</p>
<p>It was easy to make and could be afforded by the masses, so other companies saw the potential of the product.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of those companies was the Convers Rubber Co.</p>
<p>They saw the increase in popularity of Basketball and quickly realized there was a market for a shoe that fit the player's needs.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, in 1917 they came up with the first Converse All Star Basketball shoe.</p>
<p>P.S. Did you know that sneakers got their name from the word &#8220;sneak&#8221;? It was nicknamed that way because, compared to other footwear at the time, it made noticeably less noise when walking around!</p>
<p>One of the first people to recognize the All-Stars potential was Chuck H. Taylor, a professional basketball player.</p>
<p>He joined the company as a salesman in 1921 and spent the next couple of years traveling the country.</p>
<p>During this time he was conducting Basketball clinics and selling the shoes.</p>
<p>His effort was acknowledged by the company in 1932 when they added his name to the shoe ankle patch.</p>
<p>The sneaker was finally seeing an increase in sales and in 1936 it was accepted as the official footwear for the U.S. Basketball team at the Olympic Games.</p>
<div id="attachment_95424" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95424" class="wp-image-95424 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/converse-all-star-olympics.jpg" alt="white canvas sneaker with red stripe" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/converse-all-star-olympics.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/converse-all-star-olympics-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/converse-all-star-olympics-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95424" class="wp-caption-text">The Original white, red and blue &#8220;Chuck Taylor All Star&#8221; used by the U.S Olympics team</p></div>
<p>In 1957 the company introduced the first low top canvas sneakers.</p>
<p>They marketed them as a casual, everyday alternative to the high top.</p>
<p>Nowadays, canvas sneakers can be found in pretty much any menswear store. They come in an infinite number of style and color options &#8211; with the “All-Star” being the most recognizable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="agelimit"></a></p>
<h2>1. Know That There Is No Age Limit</h2>
<p>Contrary to what you might have heard, canvas sneakers are a timeless casual outfit piece that does not have a &#8220;recommended age&#8221;.</p>
<p>Everyone can wear them in the right circumstances.</p>
<p>Since sneakers originated from sports shoes, they are functional above all else, which removes any <em>&#8220;unwritten rules&#8221;</em> from them.</p>
<p>You can wear them to the gym or when playing sports, as they are still at their core athletic shoes, and they are perfect when doing lighter physical activities.</p>
<p>So, if you're going out to the park, walking your dog or you're taking your kids somewhere you're going to spend a decent amount of time walking (or even running) after them. It might be a good idea to pull out those canvas sneakers.</p>
<div id="attachment_95625" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://nothingnew.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95625" class="wp-image-95625 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nothingnew.jpg" alt="canvas sneakers in different colors" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nothingnew.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nothingnew-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nothingnew-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95625" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://nothingnew.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The innovative Nothing New Low Top's</a></p></div>
<p>It's just that &#8211; and I'm not saying this is a good thing &#8211; younger guys may get away with wearing them in more scenarios, which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="dresscodes"></a></p>
<h2>2. Pay Attention To Dress Codes</h2>
<p>The shoes you decide to wear can make or break the formality of your outfit, so it's important to understand &#8211; sneakers are <strong>always</strong> casual.</p>
<p>Choosing the wrong time and place to wear your sneakers will make them a chink in your style armor.</p>
<p>Remember, regardless of what you wear, an outfit is only as dressy as it's most casual piece.</p>
<p>You can wear them with a suit, sure, but the sneakers will make the overall feel of the outfit casual.</p>
<p>The highest you can go in terms of dressing up a pair of sneakers would be on the lighter side of business casual. Even in these scenarios, you want to wear something that doesn't stick out and grab attention from the rest of the outfit.</p>
<div id="attachment_95434" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95434" class="wp-image-95434 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sneaker-outfits.jpg" alt="sneaker outfit ideas" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sneaker-outfits.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sneaker-outfits-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sneaker-outfits-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95434" class="wp-caption-text">Some looks work with sneakers &#8211; like casual looks, but not formal styles.</p></div>
<p>White is a very popular color but it also stands out the most and it's easiest to spot when it gets dirty, making it ultra-casual.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the next rule should come at no surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="cleanthem"></a></p>
<h2>3. Make Sure Your Sneakers Are Clean</h2>
<p>Even though a lot of sneaker enthusiasts out there will tell you that the dirtier and more worn out your sneakers are, the more character they have.</p>
<p>There's no mistake that canvas sneakers are going to be harder to clean when compared to your leather shoes.</p>
<p>Leather is a smooth material and &#8211; for the most part &#8211; dirt can be brushed off, while canvas is more likely to stain and in some cases, the stain can be permanent.</p>
<p>This also leaves you with the risk of damaging the material if you attempt to clean it the wrong way.</p>
<p>When deciding on the color of your canvas sneakers, make sure to think when and where you're going to wear them.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>One of my favorite sayings: Cleanliness is next to godliness.</em></h4>
<p>The majority of sneakers feature a white sole. This can get dirty over time &#8211; so if you're looking for something that's low maintenance &#8211; consider a pair where the sole matches the color of the canvas in a color other than white.</p>
<p>You can wear the most expensive pair of shoes and it won't matter if they aren't well kept &#8211; they're going to look bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="whattowear"></a></p>
<h2>4. Know What To Pair Your Sneakers With</h2>
<p>Since canvas sneakers are a casual shoe, they look best when paired with casual bottoms, so let's break down what those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shorts:
<ul>
<li>Since shorts are the most casual bottoms, any color sneakers will go well with them, and keep the casual look.</li>
<li>Low Tops &#8211; maybe with no-show socks &#8211; work best with shorts.</li>
<li>Taller guys may be able to get away with High Tops and shorts, but it's not a look I'd recommend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Chinos/Khakis:
<ul>
<li>Lots of options with these due to the wide array of colors.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the leg opening &#8211; if it's too wide &#8211; it might cover the sneaker.</li>
<li>You can try to cuff it or get it tailored to be slimmer, which will reduce the sneaker covering.</li>
<li>Chinos and Khakis look great with both High Tops and Low Tops.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jeans:
<ul>
<li>The right pair of jeans will be your canvas sneakers best friend.</li>
<li>Pair it up with a solid color V-neck, t-shirt or sweater, to complete a great casual look.</li>
<li>Boost the look even further by adding a <a href="https://youtu.be/1rl7aHSsB48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lightweight jacket</a> for a well-layered outfit.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the contrast between the jeans and sneakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which brings me to my final point:</p>

<h2>5. Know What Colors Work With Your Sneakers</h2>
<p>Even though there aren't any <em>&#8220;official rules&#8221; </em>to wearing casual outfits, that doesn't mean some things won't look better than others.</p>
<p>The main thing to consider is contrast, which is whether or not you want your canvas sneakers to be the center of attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to show off your footwear or pants, make sure to mismatch them.</li>
<li>If you want the upper part of your outfit to draw attention, have your shoes match closely to the bottom.</li>
<li>You can fit colors to the season you're in:
<ul>
<li>For brighter summer days going for lighter colored clothing is always a good idea.</li>
<li>For darker seasons &#8211; and maybe nighttime &#8211; a darker combination will work great.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to get away with wearing canvas sneakers in a business casual setting? Go with darker colors.</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's get into it!</p>
<p><a name="section1"></a></p>
<h2>1. Forget The Power Of Confidence</h2>
<p>A truly stylish man never forgets that his biggest asset is his confidence.</p>
<p>When you wear something that makes you feel great, people around you will notice the increased confidence you will have.</p>
<p>In order for you to gain confidence in yourself and to <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-confident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feel confident</a> in what you wear, you need to practice wearing every single item you buy.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Style is whatever you want it to be, as long as you do it with confidence.</h4>
<p>Once you finish practicing in the comfort of your home<span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> you need to take the final, crucial step. A step outside of your house and into the public.</p>
<p>Go to your closest grocery store or walk around your neighborhood and see how people respond to you.</p>
<p>Once you feel comfortable enough in your clothes, you will have the confidence you need and you will be able to walk outside in anything you put on and feel great about it.</p>
<p><a name="section2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Forget To Give Compliments</h2>
<p>When you see someone on the street who looks great and who put effort into their outfit, make sure you give them a compliment.</p>
<p>Not only will they be thrilled that someone noticed their effort, but you will also feel satisfied knowing you made someone happier.</p>
<p>In most cases, once you give someone a compliment, chances are, you will also receive one back.</p>
<div id="attachment_95663" style="width: 649px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95663" class="wp-image-95663 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/42435728282_24c572272a_z.jpg" alt="man and woman smiling" width="639" height="427" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/42435728282_24c572272a_z.jpg 639w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/42435728282_24c572272a_z-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/42435728282_24c572272a_z-374x250.jpg 374w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95663" class="wp-caption-text">Never forget to compliment others!</p></div>
<p>A 2012 study out of the National Institute for Psychological Sciences in Japan had concluded that when people receive compliments, the brain reacts in the same way as when people are rewarded cash.</p>
<p>So instead of giving people a wad of cash each time they dress well, reward them with a compliment and watch them glow!</p>

<h2>3. Wear Their Big Brother's Clothing</h2>
<p>How often do you see people in clothes that looks like it was passed down for at least 3 generations?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, understand that <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fit is the most important thing</a> you need to watch out for when buying new clothing.</p>
<p>If it does not fit, you should not wear it.</p>
<div id="attachment_91098" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91098" class="wp-image-91098 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/style-law-of-fit.jpg" alt="style law of fit" width="750" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/style-law-of-fit.jpg 750w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/style-law-of-fit-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/style-law-of-fit-450x210.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-91098" class="wp-caption-text">There's a law that every man should follow, but <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/style-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fit is king</a> for every outfit.</p></div>
<p>You can always take your clothes to a tailor and have the tailor alter it in order for it to fit properly.</p>
<p>There are also stores that offer made to measure clothes online, so you can get a perfect fit from the comfort of your home.</p>
<p><a name="section4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Never Forget To Finish Off An Outfit</h2>
<p>Every stylish guy knows that details matter, especially when it comes to your outfits.</p>
<p>Every time you put on a jacket or a sports blazer, make sure you don't forget a pocket square to finish off the outfit. The same applies to the rest of your accessories and outfits.</p>
<p>Finishing off the outfit properly can make a dull outfit look amazing and that is what you should look towards when choosing how to finish off your outfit.</p>
<div id="attachment_95551" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bit.ly/2LyaIis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95551" class="wp-image-95551 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slickcollar.png" alt="slick collar" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slickcollar.png 600w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slickcollar-300x200.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/slickcollar-375x250.png 375w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95551" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://bit.ly/2LyaIis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slick Collar's Collar Stays</a> are a great way to keep your collars from looking sloppy.</p></div>
<p>One of the most important areas that men quite often forget is their collar.</p>
<p>Since the collar is the closest thing to your face, you should always make sure it stands stiff, as opposed to draping on the side.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is the finishing touches and the details in your outfits that separate you from the others.</p>
<p><a name="section5"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Buy Clothing They Won't Wear</h2>
<p>Every man needs to realize that the most expensive clothing he has are the pieces he doesn't wear.</p>
<p>Just because something is on sale, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need to buy it.</p>
<p>Stylish men know and understand the <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/build-interchangeable-wardrobe-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power of an interchangeable wardrobe</a> and they use it to make their lives easier.</p>
<div id="attachment_95594" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95594" class="wp-image-95594 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2.jpg" alt="man with a lot of shopping bags" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shopping-2-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95594" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure you only buy things you really need.</p></div>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<p>Creating a list of items you need is also a great idea to separate what you need and what you will wear, as opposed to buying clothes you don’t need and won’t wear.</p>
<p>By investing in an interchangeable wardrobe and making a list of your needs for clothing, you cut down the time you spend going around stores and also you save money because you know your priorities and you don't spend on things that you don't really need.</p>
<p><a name="section6"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Spend Big Money On Trends</h2>
<p>Trends change every couple of months, so in order to save money and build a good wardrobe, you want to avoid spending a lot of money on clothes that will be out of style a few months later.</p>
<p>The key here is to buy clothing that is timeless and that you will be able to wear even ten years from now.</p>
<p>This also allows you to spend more money on higher quality clothing that will last for a long time and that you get a lot of wears out of.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Invest in quality over quantity.</h4>
<p>The great thing about investing in an interchangeable wardrobe with quality clothing is that you will develop a feel for quality.</p>
<p>This will allow you to recognize when something is good or bad quality, so you will know if it is worth the price or not.</p>
<p><a name="section7"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Never Forget To Be Vain</h2>
<p>Similar to our point about confidence, stylish men never forget to be vain.</p>
<p>By this, we don’t mean that you should think that you are perfect and better than everybody else, but you should be proud of yourself and with the way you look, especially if you know the effort that you put in to get to that point.</p>
<p>A 2018 study out of Queen’s University of Belfast concluded that people with narcissistic tendencies show better results at work and are more likely to succeed.</p>
<div id="attachment_91745" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91745" class="wp-image-91745 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/confidence.jpeg" alt="confident man" width="730" height="380" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/confidence.jpeg 730w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/confidence-300x156.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/confidence-450x234.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /><p id="caption-attachment-91745" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure to take pride in your success.</p></div>
<p>Always take pride in whatever you are doing, know your worth and you will be able to achieve any goal that you set for yourself.</p>
<p><a name="section8"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. Never Wear Wrinkled Clothing</h2>
<p>This point should not only be on this list, but it should be general knowledge.</p>
<p>No one should wear clothes that they did not iron after washing<span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are stylish or not, you should <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/shirt-ironing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">know how to iron</a> and you should use an iron regularly.</p>
<div id="attachment_68584" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68584" class="wp-image-68584 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Shirt-Ironing-Guide-step-4.jpg" alt="man ironing dress shirt" width="700" height="362" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Shirt-Ironing-Guide-step-4.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Shirt-Ironing-Guide-step-4-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Shirt-Ironing-Guide-step-4-450x233.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-68584" class="wp-caption-text">Do YOU know how to iron?</p></div>
<p>Not only will your clothes look better, but you will also feel better knowing that you look well put together.</p>
<p><a name="section9"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. Dress Against Your Body Type</h2>
<p>A stylish man knows what his body type is and he wears clothing that flatters his body type.</p>
<p>When you buy clothing, you should never think about the body you will have in three months, or six months and buy clothing for then.</p>
<p>You should always buy clothes for the body you have right now, because otherwise, you may not reach your body goal in the given time and you will have clothes in your closet that serve no purpose at all.</p>
<p>There are also ways for you to leverage clothing to make your silhouette look better.</p>
<div id="attachment_92663" style="width: 755px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92663" class="wp-image-92663 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/male-body-shapes.jpg" alt="men body shapes" width="745" height="291" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/male-body-shapes.jpg 745w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/male-body-shapes-300x117.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/male-body-shapes-450x176.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /><p id="caption-attachment-92663" class="wp-caption-text">Know your body shape and dress accordingly.</p></div>
<p>If you are a skinny guy, you should learn how to layer properly to make yourself look bigger.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are a larger guy, then wear a jacket that builds up your shoulders so that people can focus on that, instead of your midsection.</p>
<p>Learn <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/dress-body-shape-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to dress for your body type</a> and use your clothes as a tool to look better.</p>
<p><a name="section10"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Never Wear Cheap Shoes</h2>
<p>When you think about an outfit, you should pay special attention to your shoes.</p>
<p>After all, wherever you may be going to, shoes are always going to be on the front line. You will pass over mud, holes in the street and different things people just throw on the ground.</p>
<p>This is exactly why you should never, ever wear cheap shoes.</p>
<p>And if you need another reason, then you should know that a 2012 study by a group of scientists from different universities concluded that shoes are becoming the focus of other people when they take a look at you.</p>
<p>Based off of your shoes, people will make quick judgments about you.</p>
<div id="attachment_21048" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21048" class="wp-image-21048 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RMRS-anatomy-of-a-shoe-6.3.20141.jpg" alt="anatomy of men's shoes infographic" width="640" height="554" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RMRS-anatomy-of-a-shoe-6.3.20141.jpg 640w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RMRS-anatomy-of-a-shoe-6.3.20141-300x260.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RMRS-anatomy-of-a-shoe-6.3.20141-289x250.jpg 289w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-21048" class="wp-caption-text">The anatomy of a men's shoe.</p></div>
<p>I actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDDJZuKzFIU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cut a pair of expensive dress shoes in half</a> and found out that the inside of these shoes contains better quality materials that are used to achieve maximum comfort.</p>
<p>Remember that sometimes you will be in your shoes for hours at a time, so make sure that you are comfortable in them.</p>

<h2>1. Have The Courage To Be The Best-Dressed Man</h2>
<p>Seeing as how we're in the midst of summer, it's a good time to bring in some hot (see what I did there?) tips for men.</p>
<p>Hot weather is no excuse to look like a slob, and layers aren't necessary to look amazing. It's the perfect time to practice doing more with less.</p>
<div id="attachment_86508" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-86508" class="wp-image-86508 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suede-penny-loafers.jpg" alt="suede penny loafers" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suede-penny-loafers.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suede-penny-loafers-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suede-penny-loafers-444x250.jpg 444w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-86508" class="wp-caption-text">Penny loafers are a worthy addition to any man's dress shoe collection.</p></div>
<p>The main weapon in your arsenal with which to counteract the searing heat should be linen. This material &#8211; extracted from flax &#8211; has been used for millennia as a luxury fabric for cultures used to the heat. It's perhaps the most breathable fabric out there.</p>
<p>You can find any garment in linen &#8211; shirts, trousers, sport coats, you name it. Heck, you could make an entire suit of it. This is especially useful for you gentlemen who live in perpetually hot climates.</p>
<p>What about shoewear? Loafers are comfortable and stylish alternatives for the summer. These are simple slip-on shoes that serve to upgrade a casual outfit. These include penny loafers, boat shoes, and monkstraps.</p>
<p>Wearing a long-sleeved shirt? Make sure to roll up those sleeves!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. Exercise Consistently</h2>
<p>No, doing one set of push-ups won't make you stylish. What I mean by this is to consistently exercise.</p>
<p>Why is this a simple but solid style tip for men? It may take a commitment to give you the physical results you need, but exercise yields immediate benefits. Physical activity releases endorphins, which put you in a good mood and also act as natural painkillers. These effects last for 12 hours!</p>
<div id="attachment_57401" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57401" class="wp-image-57401 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Man-In-Gym.jpg" alt="man in gym" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Man-In-Gym.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Man-In-Gym-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Man-In-Gym-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-57401" class="wp-caption-text">A quick workout may be all that you need to feel great.</p></div>
<p>You don't have to go nuts. Something brief like a jog or a set of push-ups every morning should do the trick.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate the power of exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>3. Have Great Posture</h2>
<p>This simple style tip for men is one you can practice every second.</p>
<p>Ok, this might sound a bit cliché at this point. We've all heard our parents scold us about it, but the fact is good posture is essential for a man's long-term physical health and his confidence.</p>
<div id="attachment_86613" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/clothing-and-posture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-86613" class="wp-image-86613 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/hunched-shoulder-posture.jpg" alt="hunched shoulder posture" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/hunched-shoulder-posture.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/hunched-shoulder-posture-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/hunched-shoulder-posture-444x250.jpg 444w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-86613" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/clothing-and-posture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to find out more about how posture can impact your style.</a></p></div>
<p>Let's start with some health talk. What can good posture do for you? It keeps the bones and ligaments under the right alignment, which ensures that your muscles work right. It prevents backaches and also stops the spinal column from being fixed in an abnormal position.</p>
<p>The list goes on&#8230;</p>
<p>On a psychological level, good posture contributes directly to a solid appearance. It does a lot to project a man's power and conviction to those around him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>4. Level Up Your Accessory Game &#8211; Get A Leather Bag</h2>
<p>This simple style tip for men is invaluable. Accessories are among the most crucial aspects of a wardrobe to master.</p>
<p>Just think about how much we use bags. We use them for school and for work. Many of us use them for the gym, even to take a laptop over to a friend's house. They're among the most practical of tools at a man's disposal &#8211; so why not invest in something as impeccable as the rest of your outfit?</p>
<div id="attachment_95577" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://mahileather.com/collections/travel-bag/products/the-classic-duffle-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95577" class="wp-image-95577 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle.jpg" alt="mahi duffle bag" width="700" height="587" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle-300x252.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mahi-duffle-298x250.jpg 298w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-95577" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://mahileather.com/collections/travel-bag/products/the-classic-duffle-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out MAHI's classic duffle bag.</a></p></div>
<p>What are the advantages of a quality leather bag?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Durability:</strong> Bags made of genuine leather can take a load of punishment, regardless of the bag time. They'll likewise keep your belongings safe from the elements.</li>
<li><strong>Timelessness:</strong> Leather bags have been in style for centuries. They're great for working at the office or in the outdoors. You can even pass them down!</li>
<li><strong>Saving money:</strong> It may seem like a hefty investment at first, but you'll save yourself a heck of a lot of money after you stop buying low-quality bags over and over.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Wear A Suit (You Saw This Coming)</h2>
<p>Gentlemen, it's something we talk about a lot here in RMRS. One full-proof way to look absolutely stylish is to wear a well-fitted, quality suit.</p>
<div id="attachment_89287" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89287" class="wp-image-89287 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suit-fit-guide-1.jpg" alt="suit fit guide" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suit-fit-guide-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suit-fit-guide-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/suit-fit-guide-1-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-89287" class="wp-caption-text">A suit sends a message of professionalism, power, and attention to detail to those you meet.</p></div>
<p>It's impossible to do such a topic justice with one section of an article so check out my article on <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/buy-first-suit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to shop for the perfect suit</a> to get you started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>6. Be A Storyteller</h2>
<p>The ability to tell a great story has been a treasured skillset for thousands of years. The Illiad &#8211; the oldest story ever told &#8211; was originally spoken to audiences. The power of a good story in influencing the masses can never be overstated.</p>
<p>With this comes mastering the art of conversation &#8211; something that isn't easy, but the right guidance can see any man engaging with others in a meaningful way.</p>
<div id="attachment_87940" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-87940" class="wp-image-87940 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/powerpoint-presentation.jpg" alt="man giving a speech" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/powerpoint-presentation.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/powerpoint-presentation-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/powerpoint-presentation-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-87940" class="wp-caption-text">If you have stories to tell, then tell them. You'll be surprised as to what sparks interest in people.</p></div>
<p>Need some good story starters? <strong>Here are some tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about what inspired you to launch your company, or follow your career track.</li>
<li>Explain the challenges of that journey.</li>
<li>Mention the lessons you learned.</li>
<li>Talk a little about the goals that remain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tip7"></a></p>
<h2>7. Be Funny</h2>
<p>When it comes to simple style tips for men, this may seem like another obvious one. However, it's important enough that it deserves a spot on our list.</p>
<p>Several studies have found links between humor cognition and verbal ability.</p>
<p>What does this mean in English? That there's a connection between being funny and smart. Whenever you see a man constantly making others laugh, there's a good chance he has the intellect to match.</p>
<div id="attachment_95432" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95432" class="wp-image-95432 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/funny-laughing-man.jpg" alt="funny laughing man" width="700" height="495" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/funny-laughing-man.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/funny-laughing-man-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/funny-laughing-man-354x250.jpg 354w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95432" class="wp-caption-text">Making people laugh is a sure-fire way of appearing more stylish.</p></div>
<p>The reason for this is that laughing releases dopamine. This not only makes us feel great but opens up the learning regions of the brain and makes it easier to retain information.</p>
<p>Do you need to be a comedian? No. The classiest sort of humor is high, dry humor as opposed to slapstick comedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tip8"></a></p>
<h2>8. Slow Down &#8211; No Wild Movements</h2>
<p>Something we've talked about here in RMRS is how, when approaching a woman, she'll most likely adopt a <strong>Prevention Stance</strong>. This was defined by a 2011 study from the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology as a typical response to a stranger's presence.</p>
<p>It means that she's suspicious and wary of you.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I'm here to tell you that it doesn't only apply to women. Using open body language is a good rule of thumb to coax people out of that Prevention Stance. To do this, you need to use slow and deliberate gestures.</p>
<div id="attachment_92462" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92462" class="wp-image-92462 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/business-talk.jpeg" alt="business talk" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/business-talk.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/business-talk-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/business-talk-450x225.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-92462" class="wp-caption-text">Make sure to always speak calmly and face the other person.</p></div>
<p>You need to keep your hands unclenched and in sight. Most importantly, you need to speak in a cool, relaxed manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tip9"></a></p>
<h2>9. Introduce Yourself</h2>
<p>While I'm on the topic of socializing, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention introducing yourself.</p>
<p>This is a simple but important style tip for men because it's the very first step in building a relationship of any kind. It has the ability to leave a powerful impression and &#8211; when done right &#8211; can forge a meaningful relationship.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>A strong introduction can be what changes your life for the better.</em></h4>
<p>How do you make the right introduction? Check out these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less is more. Keep it brief. That way conversations can reveal more about you in a naturally-flowing manner.</li>
<li>Keep your introduction in context. Unless you're in a business setting, your job title is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Focus on the other person. Allow them to make a longer introduction in turn, if they like.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="tip10"></a></p>
<h2>10. Be Passionate And  Talk About Those Passions</h2>
<p>Are you into Star Wars? Game of Thrones? What about the supernatural? No matter what you love, you <strong>need to talk about it</strong>.</p>
<p>We've all been there; the restaurant where people are droning on and on about something you couldn't care less about. You can't wait to get out, and it's obvious. Seeing that expression only serves to bring the mood of the entire room down.</p>
<div id="attachment_95479" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95479" class="wp-image-95479 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking.jpeg" alt="men at the table talking" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/men-at-the-table-talking-375x250.jpeg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95479" class="wp-caption-text">Always share your passions &#8211; you'll be surprised at how it captivates everyone.</p></div>
<p>Instead, once you catch a lull in the conversation, bring up the topic of your choice. Make sure it's something you love deeply, and go to town. Even if other people aren't into it, that positivity you'll exude will spread over to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. Make Final Adjustments In Public</h2>
<p>You looked at her, she looked at you. She made the first move and is coming straight at you &#8211; what do you do?</p>
<p>It's time to indulge in your vanity just a little and make a couple of final adjustments to your appearance. This can mean running your hand through your hair, adjusting your collar, or fixing your tie.</p>
<div id="attachment_95316" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95316" class="wp-image-95316 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/making-adjustments-in-public-how-to-attract-girls.jpg" alt="making adjustments in public how to attract girls" width="700" height="398" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/making-adjustments-in-public-how-to-attract-girls.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/making-adjustments-in-public-how-to-attract-girls-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/making-adjustments-in-public-how-to-attract-girls-440x250.jpg 440w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95316" class="wp-caption-text">Some quick fixes to yourself and your outfit will tell her you're interested.</p></div>
<p>Little things like this show the lady in question that not only do you care about your looks but that you care about looking your best for her.</p>
<p>It's a strong indicator of mutual attraction, and it's bound to get the conversation off to a strong start.</p>
<p>Just don't overdo it. If you spend eons checking yourself, she's going to cross another weirdo off her list.</p>
<p><a name="tip2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Lick And Touch Your Lips</h2>
<p>When it comes to how to attract women subtly, this tip is king.</p>
<p>While you're conversing with her and you feel like you're vibing well, briefly touch your lips. This can be a soft tap or short glide of your fingers.</p>
<p>This draws attention to your mouth and &#8211; if she's interested &#8211; invokes images of kissing you, enticing her further.</p>
<div id="attachment_95317" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95317" class="wp-image-95317 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/benedict-cumberpatch-touching-lips.jpg" alt="benedict cumberpatch touching lips" width="700" height="390" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/benedict-cumberpatch-touching-lips.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/benedict-cumberpatch-touching-lips-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/benedict-cumberpatch-touching-lips-450x250.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95317" class="wp-caption-text">A low-key gesture toward your lips will get her thinking about kissing them.</p></div>
<p>Again, remember to do this sparingly. Don't go rubbing your lips like a lunatic!</p>
<p><a name="tip3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Take Up Space</h2>
<p>When you think of domination in the Animal Kingdom, what do you see? A lion's mane, a bear standing on its hind legs, a gorilla puffing and beating his chest. What do these all have in common? <strong>Space. </strong></p>
<p>Animals will always try to make themselves appear much larger than normal in order to subjugate other males and impress mates. To some degree, this applies to us as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_95318" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95318" class="wp-image-95318 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/man-taking-up-space.jpg" alt="man taking up space waiting for a lady" width="700" height="323" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/man-taking-up-space.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/man-taking-up-space-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/man-taking-up-space-450x208.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95318" class="wp-caption-text">The more space you take up, the more dominant you appear.</p></div>
<p>What are some ways you can take up space? Spread your legs apart a little. If the seat next to you is empty, put your arm around it.</p>
<p>Power and status are established by manipulating your space gents, remember that. She'll notice you before the guy next to you.</p>
<p><a name="tip4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Stand Your Ground</h2>
<p>How to attract women in the simplest way possible? Don't move.</p>
<p>No, this doesn't mean freeze, but it does mean not to move away from the woman you're interested in.</p>
<p>Whether it be when she first approaches you or several minutes into the conversation, it's important to let her determine how close she wants to get.</p>
<div id="attachment_89785" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/communicating-power-posture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89785" class="wp-image-89785 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/how-to-look-better-stand-up-straight.jpg" alt="how to look better stand up straight" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/how-to-look-better-stand-up-straight.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/how-to-look-better-stand-up-straight-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/how-to-look-better-stand-up-straight-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-89785" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/communicating-power-posture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here for some tips on how to look powerful just by standing straight!</a></p></div>
<p>If she tries to get inside a little and you recoil, it immediately tells her you're not interested &#8211; whether it was out of shyness or not.</p>
<p><a name="tip5"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Make Eye Contact</h2>
<p>A person's eyes are powerful communicators. With a simple look, you can make another feel recognized and validated.</p>
<p>A 2002 study out of MIT found that even as infants, we follow our parents' eyes before anything else.</p>
<p>The power of the eyes is ingrained. It's no wonder, then, that it's one of your chief tools of seduction.</p>
<div id="attachment_88051" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/eye-contact-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-88051" class="wp-image-88051 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dd6724df-e90c-4532-a5d6-028a0a75d1ca-1-1-1.jpeg" alt="zoomed in eye" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dd6724df-e90c-4532-a5d6-028a0a75d1ca-1-1-1.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dd6724df-e90c-4532-a5d6-028a0a75d1ca-1-1-1-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dd6724df-e90c-4532-a5d6-028a0a75d1ca-1-1-1-450x225.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-88051" class="wp-caption-text">Keeping <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/eye-contact-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eye contact</a> with her is a great way to showcase respect and conviction.</p></div>
<p>Keeping a stalwart gaze showcases strength and confidence, but the minute you glance away you're conveying weakness and insecurity.</p>
<p>Like in all things, balance is key. Don't stare at her like The Joker about to commit a crime.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Strut Your Shoulders And Walk With Confidence</h2>
<p>A 2007 study from Texas A&M University revealed that men with so-called &#8220;shoulder swagger&#8221; are considered over 50% more attractive.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Strut your shoulders while walking to command attention.</em></h4>
<p>While moving, make sure to sway our shoulders back and forth. Like previous gestures we've discussed, doing this right makes a man exude power through his walk.</p>
<p>One excellent example of this is the entirety of the show Suits. One of the main characters, Harvey Specter, epitomizes the clean-cut and powerful male archetype. As he walks in tailored suits, he consistently sways his shoulders back and forth &#8211; commanding everyone's attention as he goes by.</p>
<p>Daniel Craig's Bond also does this well. Though, the scene where it's most prominent is Casino Royale where he's emerging from the water at the beach. Even without dressing well, you can see how imposing it makes him look.</p>

<p><a name="tip7"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Dress Sharp</h2>
<p>Gentlemen, it shouldn't surprise you that women are attracted to well-dressed men.</p>
<p>There's no way to do the subject any justice in one measly section, but remember that you can't go wrong with clean, wrinkle-free clothing that fits well.</p>
<div id="attachment_89290" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89290" class="wp-image-89290 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/custom-suit-fit.jpg" alt="custom suit fit" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/custom-suit-fit.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/custom-suit-fit-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/custom-suit-fit-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-89290" class="wp-caption-text">Dressing well is one of the most important strategies to garnering a woman's attention.</p></div>
<p>For starters, stick to a pair of fitted jeans, a button-down, and some casual shoes &#8211; preferably Chelsea or Chukka boots.</p>
<p><a name="tip8"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. Show Social proof</h2>
<p>Surrounding yourself with people who accept you ups your social prestige, and thus your likelihood to attract a lady without saying a word to her.</p>
<p>Don't believe me? Let's refer to a 2015 study out of Whitman College. The survey proved overwhelmingly that potential partners with peer reviews were strongly preferred over those with no reviews at all &#8211; regardless of looks.</p>
<div id="attachment_95324" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95324" class="wp-image-95324 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/female-friends-how-to-attract-girls.jpg" alt="female friends how to attract girls" width="700" height="401" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/female-friends-how-to-attract-girls.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/female-friends-how-to-attract-girls-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/female-friends-how-to-attract-girls-436x250.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95324" class="wp-caption-text">If you show up with friends &#8211; especially female friends &#8211; you incite curiosity in nearby singles.</p></div>
<p>This means that it's time to take the boys out for drinks. To put it candidly, every friend you have a good time with is another person that doesn't consider you a freak &#8211; and women notice this.</p>
<p><a name="tip9"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. Wear Your Signature Scent</h2>
<p>As you'd imagine, how you smell plays a pivotal role in how to attract women without speaking to them.</p>
<p>As humans, we rely on scent to form an assessment of others. This is especially true for women, who boast over 40% more olfactory cells in the brain than we do. That's right gents; they can easily pick up on your scent.</p>
<div id="attachment_93882" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/top-mens-summer-colognes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93882" class="wp-image-93882 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4-1-e1498762464628.jpg" alt="creed virgin island water mens cologne" width="700" height="555" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4-1-e1498762464628.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4-1-e1498762464628-300x238.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4-1-e1498762464628-315x250.jpg 315w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-93882" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/top-mens-summer-colognes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wanting to smell great this summer? Click here for a list of the best summer fragrances.</a></p></div>
<p>Since our natural odor mixes with fragrance to create a unique scent, it's up to you to pick a cologne that resonates and put it to good use.</p>
<p>Don't overdo it, though. Two or three squirts should be more than enough to be pleasant for the ladies.</p>
<p><a name="tip10"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Use The Right Gestures</h2>
<p>My last tip on how to attract women without a word? Make her comfortable with the right gestures.</p>
<p>This comes out of a 2011 study from the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. In it, researchers discovered that people tend to adopt one of two social stances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promotion Focus:</strong> The person feels optimistic, hopeful, and open about you.</li>
<li><strong>Prevention Focus:</strong> The person is cautious, mistrusting, and vigilant.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_94272" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94272" class="size-full wp-image-94272" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29.jpg" alt="conversation date" width="700" height="530" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-29-330x250.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94272" class="wp-caption-text">When you start the conversation, make sure to keep open body language.</p></div>
<p>With you as a stranger, she will likely adopt a prevention focus at first. It's up to you to get her into the promotion stage.</p>
<p>Do this by using precise and small gestures. Use slower movements and speech, and lean back &#8211; away from her.</p>
<p>Don't clench your fists, don't keep your hands in your pockets, and don't cross your arms. These gestures put out a hostile and unfriendly vibe. Avoid these and you'll be on the right track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The selflessness and the risk that young men and women go through every day when they enlist, to protect you, is something that is worth admiring.</p>
<p>As someone who has been a part of the United States Marine Corps, I know what we had to go through to ensure that we are the best at what we do. The best at protecting our country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-95402 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/header-marine.jpg" alt="marine uniform life lessons" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/header-marine.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/header-marine-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/header-marine-438x250.jpg 438w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Other than the training I received necessary for my deployment, I also learned how precious life is and that I should enjoy every moment.</p>
<p>I won’t go into details about how you can disarm someone with three simple steps, however I will give you guys a list of the 10 kick ass life lessons the military taught me.</p>
<p>So let’s begin!</p>

<p><a name="section1"></a></p>
<h2>1. Learn The Basics</h2>
<p>When someone enlists into the Marines, they undergo a 10-week basic training program. While people may think that young men and women learn everything they need to know about being a US Marine during the program, they are wrong.</p>
<p>The first 10 weeks are just an introduction to what kind of life you can expect.</p>
<p>You learn how to make your bed, you go through basic drills and you learn the importance of teamwork.</p>
<p>It is not until you are an official member of the United States Marine Corps that you will be sent to your first duty station where you will learn more and more.</p>
<div id="attachment_84937" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84937" class="wp-image-84937" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Style-101.jpg" alt="antonio with a book style 101" width="450" height="599" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Style-101.jpg 350w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Style-101-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Style-101-188x250.jpg 188w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-84937" class="wp-caption-text">Master the basics of anything you do before you move on &#8211; even style!</p></div>
<p>Gentlemen, the same applies to your everyday life. Whenever you try to better your life in some way, you first need to learn and understand the basics.</p>
<p>It is only when you have mastered the basic knowledge, the 101s, that you can move on to bigger and better things.</p>
<p>I have met many men who thought they knew the basics or that they knew everything, but they haven't even mastered the basics!</p>
<p>Unless you understand and know the basics, you can never move on to the next step.</p>
<p>Always remember that.</p>
<p><a name="section2"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>2. Work Hard And Be Proud Of It</h2>
<p>No matter what your position in a company is, you should always be proud of it. Especially if you worked hard for it.</p>
<p>During the graduation ceremony that I watched, all of the young men and women who were about to become Marines were asked a question by their Commanding Officer. They all answered proudly with one accord.</p>
<div id="attachment_95363" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95363" class="wp-image-95363" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/soldiers-in-line.jpg" alt="soldiers standing in line" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/soldiers-in-line.jpg 5616w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/soldiers-in-line-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/soldiers-in-line-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/soldiers-in-line-375x250.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95363" class="wp-caption-text">Take pride in your hard work.</p></div>
<p>The young men and women, although the lowest rank in the Marines, all looked proud to be standing where they were because they knew how much hard work, effort and time they put in to get where they were.</p>
<p>That drive is what you should focus on as well. Put in the time, put in the effort and put in the work that is necessary to get to whatever position you want, but always be proud of where you are right now.</p>
<p>This has been one of the most helpful life lessons that the military taught me.</p>
<p><a name="section3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. No &#8220;I&#8221; In Team</strong></h2>
<p>Every time there's a group of people involved, you need to realize that you need to work as a team.</p>
<p>What is good for the entire group will likely be good for you as well.</p>
<p>If you are just starting your journey to becoming a better person than you were the day before, don't think that you can achieve all of it by yourself.</p>
<div id="attachment_94553" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94553" class="wp-image-94553 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1.jpg" alt="people in office working as a team" width="700" height="457" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1-383x250.jpg 383w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94553" class="wp-caption-text">Effective teamwork leads to outstanding results.</p></div>
<p>There are people with more experience than you and who have been in the game for a longer time than you, so don't be afraid to ask for opinions or guidance.</p>
<p>The power of teamwork is a life lesson that the military taught me that has stood the test of time, and will continue to stand forever.</p>
<p><a name="section4"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>4. The Power Of Uniform</strong></h2>
<p>If you have been following us for some time, then you already know how much we stress the <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-uniform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power of a uniform</a>. For every man, it will be different depending on what message you are trying to send.</p>
<p>In the Marine Corps, we all had to wear uniforms. We were all in great shape and some of us had our uniforms altered to fit us perfectly.</p>
<p>For those of us whose uniforms had been altered, we were always looked at differently than those who were sloppy and didn't care about how their uniform was altered.</p>
<p>What we realized and they didn't is that the better you look in your uniform, the more trustworthy you are.</p>
<div id="attachment_52081" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-52081" class="wp-image-52081" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12844917745_b1c00510f7_o.jpg" alt="tailor measuring a customer" width="400" height="527" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12844917745_b1c00510f7_o.jpg 400w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12844917745_b1c00510f7_o-228x300.jpg 228w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12844917745_b1c00510f7_o-190x250.jpg 190w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-52081" class="wp-caption-text">Have you found your uniform yet?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter the uniform you choose to wear, you should always make sure that it fits you properly and that it reflects who you are.</p>
<p>There's power in the way you dress gentlemen, so find that uniform and wear it proudly.</p>
<p><a name="section5"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>5. Details Matter</strong></h2>
<p>When you look at a general's uniform, you will notice the medals and ribbons on his chest.</p>
<p>These medals and ribbons each represent a different thing and they are put in the exact spot that they are meant to be put in. Each of them had to be earned in one way or another.</p>
<p>If in the military, you are spotted wearing medals that you did not earn then there could be serious consequences, from being kicked out, all the way to being put in jail for falsely presenting yourself.</p>
<div id="attachment_46848" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46848" class="wp-image-46848 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/details.jpg" alt="details on uniform" width="700" height="433" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/details.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/details-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/details-404x250.jpg 404w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-46848" class="wp-caption-text">Always pay attention to the details.</p></div>
<p>In civilian life, the same can be applied. You always want to look at the details that you are wearing, that they are put in the right place and that they <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/signal-power-clothing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send the message that you want to send</a>.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether it's a watch, a bracelet, a necklace or a pocket square, make sure to pay attention to the details and to use them as a tool to spread your message.</p>
<p>The same applies to your work. If you pay attention to the details that others don't, you will be remembered as a more effective worker who gives it his all to the company.</p>
<p><a name="section6"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>6. Practice Makes Perfect</strong></h2>
<p>In order to be as close to perfect as possible, you need to practice. This doesn't only include sports, but every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>If you choose to start dressing better, you can't expect to nail it overnight.</p>
<p>You need to practice putting on your clothes, wearing it the way that it is meant to be worn and looking at yourself in the mirror to see what you can improve on.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">The key to perfection is practice.</h4>
<p>If you decide to bring in a new accessory into your wardrobe, or a new piece of clothing, the best way to get used to it is to put it on at home and practice wearing it.</p>
<p>Walk around the house in it &#8211; see how it feels. Then walk to your nearest grocery store or run some errands.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you will wear it outside without thinking twice about it.</p>
<p>Practice is key, gentlemen, to mastering any skill and <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-time-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being more productive</a>.</p>
<p><a name="section7"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>7. Follow The Dress Code</strong></h2>
<p>Another important thing that I always remind you of is the importance of following the dress code.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the military there is a strict dress code that must be followed at all times, otherwise, you put yourself at risk of being disciplined.</p>
<p>This rule has become a life lesson that the military taught me but I now use every single day to up my style.</p>
<p>In everyday life, you may be told that there is no dress code, but that is not the case.</p>
<div id="attachment_70308" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/guide-dress-codes-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70308" class="wp-image-70308 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/men-follow-different-dress-codes.jpg" alt="men dress codes" width="700" height="331" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/men-follow-different-dress-codes.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/men-follow-different-dress-codes-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/men-follow-different-dress-codes-450x213.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-70308" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/guide-dress-codes-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn and apply the proper dress code in every situation you find yourself in.</a></p></div>
<p>You always need to look at what others are wearing and mimic the overall atmosphere regarding clothing. If you work in a grocery store, obviously you won't wear a suit, but you can always pick an accessory that will make you stand out from the others.</p>
<p>Make sure you remember that there is always a dress code and make sure you follow it.</p>
<p><a name="section8"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>8. Social Ranks</strong></h2>
<p>In the military, ranks are pretty clear. You have lieutenants, captains, majors and so on.</p>
<p>The lower ranks always salute the higher ranks when they pass by them.</p>
<p>In the civilian world, social ranks may not be so obvious, but they still exist.</p>
<div id="attachment_95382" style="width: 715px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95382" class="wp-image-95382 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/military-ranks.jpg" alt="list-of-military-ranks" width="705" height="495" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/military-ranks.jpg 705w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/military-ranks-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/military-ranks-356x250.jpg 356w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /><p id="caption-attachment-95382" class="wp-caption-text">Social ranks may not be as clear as the military ranks, but they are still there.</p></div>
<p>How many times have you seen a man, dressed to the standards of success, get the extra benefits?</p>
<p>Understand that with the way you dress and the way you present yourself, people will make quick judgments about you and they will act accordingly.</p>
<p><a name="section9"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>9. Dress Appropriately</strong></h2>
<p>Following on from the previous point, you always need to dress appropriately for your social standing.</p>
<p>If you are a high ranking general in the military, you will always wear your stripes when you are in the base, so that the men and women that you pass by know who you are, even without personally knowing you.</p>
<p>If you forget to wear your stripes then those who don't know you will not know what your status is.</p>
<div id="attachment_94771" style="width: 738px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/proper-mens-attire-all-occasions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94771" class="wp-image-94771 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/man-in-suit-playing-on-beach.jpg" alt="man in suit on the beach" width="728" height="526" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/man-in-suit-playing-on-beach.jpg 728w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/man-in-suit-playing-on-beach-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/man-in-suit-playing-on-beach-346x250.jpg 346w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94771" class="wp-caption-text">You need to know <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/proper-mens-attire-all-occasions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to dress appropriately for all situations</a>.</p></div>
<p>The same applies to everyday life. If you are a CEO of a multi-million dollar company, you need to dress the part.</p>
<p>People will not take you seriously if you don't present yourself in the way that you need to, especially in the business world.</p>
<p>The point here is that appearance and clothing matters and you need to take full advantage of that.</p>
<p><a name="section10"></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>10. People Remember Your Character</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most important lessons that I learned in the military is that people will remember you for many things that you don't see as important.</p>
<p>For me, I was surprised when people remembered some events that made them have an opinion about who I am as a man &#8211; things I didn't even remember.</p>
<p>In today's world especially, people are more than ever being judged based on their character.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Our ability to handle life's challenges is a measure of our strength of character.</h4>
<p>The importance of your character is a key life lesson that the military taught me which has gone on to impact all areas of my life, with amazing results!</p>
<p>So if you are a good guy, with <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/marine-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good leadership skills</a> who takes care of his team and genuinely cares about the well being of others, guess what, people will remember that and in a lot of cases that means more than the actual results.</p>
<p>However, we are not saying that you should ignore the results and be nice to everybody, but understand that the better you lead your team and the better person you are to each individual in your team, the more they will work in order to show you an appreciation for your leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Picture this: You wake up in the morning, you already have a pile of emails from your boss asking for updates.</p>
<p>Your kids need help getting ready. Your wife needs your help around the house.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you've skipped lunch and you're stuck in the office until 9 pm. Dinner at home got cold.</p>
<p>Gents, I'm going to tell you how to fix that &#8211; here are my top five simple habits for men to get sh!t done.</p>

<h2>1. Learn How To Prioritize Tasks</h2>
<p>A busy man can easily lose himself in his work. The more tasks that pile up, the more you might find yourself scrambling to solve them as they come. If you aren't careful you might be stretching yourself thin.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, make a habit of compiling the tasks you have by urgency using the priority matrix.</p>
<div id="attachment_86232" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-86232" class="wp-image-86232 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/eisenhower-matrix-for-print-rmrs1-e1558564446662.jpg" alt="urgency matrix priorities list useful" width="700" height="1007" /><p id="caption-attachment-86232" class="wp-caption-text">The Priority (Eisenhower) Matrix is a good way to organize the highest and lowest priorities throughout your day.</p></div>
<p>What should comprise your most urgent goals? Work that &#8211; if not completed soon &#8211; will have severe and immediate consequences.</p>
<p>Examples are missed deadlines with clients, or prepping for a big promotion interview.</p>
<p>Another approach is to assess what the stakes are in completing the task. If it affects a larger number of people, it's another reason to give it precedence.</p>

<h2>2. Stop Taking In Unnecessary Information</h2>
<p>Waking up to a hail of work emails and household chores can make for a chaotic start to the day.</p>
<p>Effective time management for men can sometimes be a matter of consolidating and restricting the time in which information reaches you. The less you take in at a time, the better you'll be at getting everything you need to be done.</p>
<div id="attachment_94550" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://audible.com/RMRS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94550" class="wp-image-94550 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/audible.jpg" alt="audible books that speak to you" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/audible.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/audible-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/audible-445x250.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94550" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://audible.com/RMRS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out the amazing audiobooks that Audible has to offer.</a></p></div>
<p>It may be difficult, but waking up earlier can go a long way to garnering that efficiency. I always recommend <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/morning-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waking up at 5 am.</a> It's not about getting less sleep, it's about carving out extra time for yourself.</p>
<p>By taking measures to control how information gets to you, you'll be one step closer to mastering time management!</p>
<p><a name="section3"></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Make A Plan</h2>
<p>This may seem fairly obvious to most guys, but it's important for a different reason than you'd expect. Yes, it's key to establish your strategy toward attaining any goal &#8211; whether it be a new car or a million dollars &#8211; but what's more important than the plan itself?</p>
<p><strong>The planning process. </strong></p>
<div id="attachment_94552" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94552" class="wp-image-94552 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-17.jpg" alt="planning out" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-17.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-17-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94552" class="wp-caption-text">The more you practice planning, the better you'll adapt.</p></div>
<p>Why do I say this? Because nine out of ten times, things won't go according to plan. you'll inevitably be thrown a curveball and you'll be forced to reconsider your plan of attack.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean ditching your goal &#8211; on the contrary, you may find the drive to pursue it with even more determination. By making a consistent habit out of planning however, you become a man of flexibility. As you gather more planning experience, you'll be better at working around problems and developing new solutions.</p>
<p><a name="section4"></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Take Massive Action</h2>
<p>I say to take massive action over simply working hard because it's a claim that everyone makes, yet it's seldom the case.</p>
<div id="attachment_94553" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94553" class="wp-image-94553 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1.jpg" alt="office teamwork coworker fist bump" width="700" height="457" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-18-1-383x250.jpg 383w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94553" class="wp-caption-text">Surrounding yourself with a team of motivated teammates will raise your chances of finding success in work.</p></div>
<p>This is all about keeping a steady pace toward your goals and keeping a high standard throughout.</p>
<p>Keeping yourself motivated to be disciplined is a challenge, which is why it's essential to surround yourself with people who work just as hard and have as great an attitude as you do!</p>
<p><a name="section5"></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Never Forget To Celebrate</h2>
<p>Last but not least when it comes to simple habits for a more productive life for men is to <strong>celebrate! </strong></p>
<p>It's something many of us forget as we become tied up and utterly focused on responsibilities. We pride ourselves in working our bodies to the breaking point, being up and at 'em by 7 am and taking a breather at 10 pm.</p>
<div id="attachment_94555" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94555" class="wp-image-94555 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1.jpg" alt="family day" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94555" class="wp-caption-text">Remember to schedule out some quality time with the people closest to you.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just as important to set some time aside for the other things that matter &#8211; such as yourself and your family.</p>
<p>The other reason I advocate for waking up at 5 am is you can indulge in what you like. For at least two hours, you have time to do what's important to you &#8211; whether it's going to the gym, having a cup of coffee or listening to an audiobook.</p>
<p>Make sure to schedule fun time with the family as well. Your success is meaningless if you can't share it with your loved ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In Summary &#8211; Time Management For Men</h2>
<p>Let's do a quick rundown of what we covered:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">Prioritizing the most urgent tasks</a></strong> will keep your head in the game.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Controlling how information gets to you</a></strong> will mitigate chaos.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Planning </a></strong>is more important than the plan itself.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#section4">Take massive action</a></strong> &#8211; work hard and surround yourself with others who do the same.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#section5">Never forget to celebrate</a></strong> even the smallest successes.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, it's all about consolidating and controlling your workflow. Keep these in mind and you'll be getting stuff done without driving yourself nuts.</p>

<p>Without further ado gents, let's get into how men's confidence can be leveled up&#8230;</p>
<p><a name="confidence1"></a></p>
<h2>1. Stop Buying Knock-Off brands</h2>
<p>No, I'm not going to tell you to spend more money &#8211; but what if I told you that spending less on counterfeit brands has a detrimental effect on our confidence?</p>
<p>Evidence for this comes out of a 2011 study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.</p>
<div id="attachment_91894" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/buy-rolex-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91894" class="wp-image-91894 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/oyster-per-daytona.jpg" alt="Fake Rolex Oyster Perpetual Daytona Cosmograph" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/oyster-per-daytona.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/oyster-per-daytona-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/oyster-per-daytona-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-91894" class="wp-caption-text">Don't waste your money on fakes!</p></div>
<p>It found that individuals who opt for knock-off brands often develop a lowered sense of self-worth.</p>
<p>Individuals were randomly asked to use generic and brand-name computer equipment to make a personal assessment for an upcoming recruitment orientation.</p>
<p>Those who used the generic equipment assumed that they'd earn a lower salary.</p>
<p>When the same experiment was done with accessories with respect to personal relationships, participants were wary of how they'd be judged by others.</p>
<p>Now, this doesn't necessarily apply to everything.</p>
<p>If you're shopping and the off-brand cereal you get has the same ingredients at a cheaper price, go for it. However, never go and buy a fake Rolex or fake leather shoes.</p>
<p>Wearing high-quality jewelry and other accessories will have a higher chance of boosting men's confidence &#8211; get quality, or nothing at all.</p>
<p><a name="confidence2"></a></p>
<h2>2. Ignore The Negative Voices In Your Head</h2>
<p>When it comes to men's confidence, self-doubt is natural &#8211; but it shouldn't dominate you.</p>
<p>Various events in life affect us in different ways.</p>
<p>In some cases, it can damage our confidence in such a way that we can feel paralyzed.</p>
<div id="attachment_93236" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93236" class="wp-image-93236 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/man-meditating.jpg" alt="man meditating" width="700" height="335" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/man-meditating.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/man-meditating-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/man-meditating-450x215.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-93236" class="wp-caption-text">Meditating for a few minutes at a time can help purge yourself of negative thoughts.</p></div>
<p>The first thing you need to do is determine if the threat is real.</p>
<p>If it is, then take a step back and formulate a plan of action to overcome it.</p>
<p>It's especially important to analyze whether or not the danger is even real &#8211; in which case it needs to be let go.</p>
<p>One solution is to practice meditation.</p>
<p>A study from Emory University found that 20 minutes of daily meditation is associated with changes in the connectivity of the region in the brain that controls attention.</p>
<p>This allows you to eliminate distractions and relax.</p>
<p><a name="confidence3"></a></p>
<h2>3. Take a Shower</h2>
<p>Is there a relationship between body odor and men's confidence? You bet.</p>
<p>A 2009 study out of Liverpool University took a sample from two groups of men. One group was instructed to use a scented deodorant and told not to shower prior to the end of the experiment.</p>
<div id="attachment_58924" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-58924" class="wp-image-58924 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/man-in-shower-e1559075110274.jpg" alt="morning shower" width="700" height="386" /><p id="caption-attachment-58924" class="wp-caption-text">The simple act of showering can go a long way to boosting men's confidence.</p></div>
<p>The participants then made videos of themselves which were assessed by a panel of eight female judges. They voted that the men who were cleaner and used scented deodorants were visibly more confident and thus more attractive.</p>
<p>In other words?</p>
<p>Staying on top of your hygiene will make you feel great.</p>
<p><a name="confidence4"></a></p>
<h2>4. Wear The Right Colors</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, there's a direct correlation between men's confidence and the colors they wear.</p>
<p>Let's bring in another study &#8211; a 2010 article from the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology.</p>
<p>A group of women ranked men wearing red, black, blue, and green as equally attractive.</p>
<div id="attachment_89237" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89237" class="wp-image-89237 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/red-and-black-velvet-blazer.jpg" alt="red and black velvet tuxedo" width="700" height="360" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/red-and-black-velvet-blazer.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/red-and-black-velvet-blazer-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/red-and-black-velvet-blazer-450x231.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-89237" class="wp-caption-text">Red is often a color associated with power and attractiveness.</p></div>
<p>However, yellow and white were rated as being a little less hot than the bolder colors above.</p>
<p>Stepping out of your comfort zone and trying on bolder colors may see others see you as better-looking and outgoing.</p>
<p><a name="confidence5"></a></p>
<h2>5. Start Working Out</h2>
<p>A meta-analysis conducted in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology has a lot to say about men's confidence. The experiment indicated that consistent exercise was shown to improve body image and confidence as a result.</p>
<div id="attachment_76553" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-76553" class="wp-image-76553 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/morning-routine-gym-muscles-body-e1539484005918.jpeg" alt="muscled man body - mens confidence" width="700" height="349" /><p id="caption-attachment-76553" class="wp-caption-text">Consistent exercise won't only get you in shape but make you feel great.</p></div>
<p>Exercise mitigates the effects of cortisol &#8211; a stress hormone &#8211; and releases endorphins which improve your overall happiness.</p>
<p>Hit the gym, gents.</p>
<p>Build a routine for yourself and stick to it.</p>
<p><a name="confidence6"></a></p>
<h2>6. Surround Yourself With Nature</h2>
<p>It may seem a bit cheesy, but hear me out.</p>
<p>Numerous studies proved that simply being in the outdoors can boost men's confidence.</p>
<div id="attachment_94699" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94699" class="wp-image-94699 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-20.jpg" alt="beautiful natural park with bench" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-20.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-20-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94699" class="wp-caption-text">The simple act of going to the nearest park can help your confidence.</p></div>
<p>It acts as a form of meditation which allows you to gradually expunge negative thoughts and focus in on yourself.</p>
<p><a name="confidence7"></a></p>
<h2>7.  Think Happy Thoughts</h2>
<p>Men's confidence is linked intimately with happiness.</p>
<p>It's not enough to simply sit back and think about happiness though, you have to go out and engage with it.</p>
<div id="attachment_94700" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94700" class="wp-image-94700 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-21-e1559183951926.jpg" alt="happy man in red shirt - mens confidence" width="700" height="347" /><p id="caption-attachment-94700" class="wp-caption-text">Believe it or not, having a positive outlook can have a huge impact on your confidence.</p></div>
<p>To do this, make sure to do something you genuinely enjoy &#8211; whether it's playing an instrument or playing videogames.</p>
<p>These are little things that'll boost your overall confidence.</p>

<h2>8. Remember Your Best Moments</h2>
<p>Somewhat on the same strain as happy thoughts, recalling some of life's best highlights can really impact men's confidence.</p>
<p>This comes out of a 2013 paper from the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. When participants were asked to think about times they felt either powerful or weak, it showcased a marked impact on performance in job interviews and applications.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Remind yourself of your greatest victories to know you can make new ones. </strong></em></h4>
<p>Remember that time you got an excellent grade on your paper despite being on a time crunch or the time you took the lead on a difficult project.</p>
<p>It'll help you believe you're worthy of more triumphs down the road, which you are!</p>
<p><a name="confidence9"></a></p>
<h2>9. Give Yourself A Pep Talk</h2>
<p>Talk to yourself &#8211; no, you're not crazy.</p>
<p>The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found a strong link between positive affirmations and confidence.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>A positive and vocal mantra will work to reassure you and boost your confidence.</strong></em></h4>
<p>If you're stuck in a rut, give yourself a verbal pat on the back.</p>
<p>Reassure yourself that you've been through tougher challenges, that you're qualified for that job opportunity and that you've got the skills for your projects.</p>
<p><a name="confidence10"></a></p>
<h2>10. Leverage Superstition</h2>
<p>Some people might scoff at superstition, but embracing it to an extent can improve men's confidence.</p>
<p>Research from the University of Cologne suggests that indulging in superstitious tendencies could have a profound impact on individual performance. Volunteers that used a lucky charm did better in memory games than those who didn't.</p>
<div id="attachment_94703" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94703" class="wp-image-94703 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-22.jpg" alt="lucky charm mens confidence" width="700" height="403" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-22.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-22-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Webp.net-compress-image-22-434x250.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94703" class="wp-caption-text">Using a lucky charm and leveraging superstition can embolden you.</p></div>
<p>This isn't because they're actually lucky, but because they inspire us to be bolder.</p>
<p>Whether it's a lucky jockstrap (please wash it) or a rabbit's foot, hold on to a charm &#8211; you might do great things with it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bonus: Turn Up That Bass</h2>
<p>Want to boost your confidence? Listen to Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Hans Zimmer. They're so good they'll instantly make you better&#8230;</p>
<p>No, I'm kidding &#8211; but there is scientific evidence that links music to men's confidence.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Want to feel empowered? Listen to music with high bass.</strong></em></h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">A 2014 study in the Journal of Social Psychological and Personality Science saw researchers manipulate bass levels and gauged the reaction of participants.</p>
<p>Higher bass levels were directly associated with evoking a sense of power.</p>
<p>Want to know the most empowering song? &#8211; Queen's &#8220;We Will Rock You&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pump up the volume, gents!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In Summary &#8211; Men's Confidence</h2>
<p>Let's run through what we've just discussed that boost confidence:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence1">Avoid off-brands and counterfeits</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence2">Ignore the negative voices in your head</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence3">Take normal showers</a>!</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence4">Wear black, red, blue, and green</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence5">Exercise regularly</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence6">Surround yourself with nature</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence7">Always think happy thoughts</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#confidence8">Remember your best moments</a>.</strong></li>
<li><a href="#confidence9"><strong>Give yourself a pep talk</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="#confidence10"><strong>Leverage superstition</strong></a></li>
</ol>
<p>As men, we face numerous hurdles that sap our confidence. But by doing these little things, you can keep your confidence under control and be the man you know yourself to be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people are lying to you.</p>
<p>A 2002 study at the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that 60% of people lied during a 10-minute conversation.</p>
<p>And they didn't just lie once&#8230; they told an average of two to three lies in that time.</p>
<p>Fortunately &#8211; there are some surprising tricks to spot a liar.</p>
<p>Once you know the giveaway signs &#8211; you'll know how to display honesty as well.</p>

<p>So what are the body language mistakes that tell you when someone is lying?</p>
<p>This first one is pretty subtle &#8211; blink and you'll miss it&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ways To Spot A Liar No. 1: <a id="1"></a>Blinking</h2>
<p>Most people blink approximately 5-6 times per minute &#8211; once every 10-12 seconds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a 2008 study found that people blink less when they're lying &#8211; but then blink up to 8 times FASTER than normal after the lie has been told.</p>
<p>Dr. Sharon Leal from Britain's Portsmouth University placed electrodes around the eyes of two groups of volunteers.</p>
<p>One group went about their normal business. The others had to steal an exam paper and then deny having taken it.</p>
<div id="attachment_44001" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44001" class="wp-image-44001" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/black-and-white-man-person-eyes-large.jpg" alt="eye contact" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/black-and-white-man-person-eyes-large.jpg 890w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/black-and-white-man-person-eyes-large-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/black-and-white-man-person-eyes-large-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/black-and-white-man-person-eyes-large-375x250.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-44001" class="wp-caption-text">Is he telling the truth? Check his blink rate.</p></div>
<p>When asked to describe what happened, the liars all blinked very slowly &#8211; but as soon as the conversation was over their blink rate increased rapidly.</p>
<p>Dr. Leal believes we blink slower due to the mental effort of making up lies.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this for us non-liars (you're all perfectly honest, right guys?) is that blink rate plays a role in <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/gain-trust-body-language/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">looking trustworthy</a> &#8211; so if you've got dry eyes or allergies you should do something about it before you run for president.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. <a id="2"></a>Sudden Head Movements</h2>
<p>When you ask someone a question, watch their head.</p>
<p>A liar might quickly jerk their head back or sideways before they respond &#8211; this shows that they're trying to think of an answer quickly.</p>
<p>So to show honesty, keep your head still when someone asks a question &#8211; unless you're nodding or shaking it, of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. <a id="3"></a>Saying One Thing But Doing Another</h2>
<p>In the book Spy The Lie, ex-CIA officers Philip Houston, Michael Floyd, and Susan Carnicero explain that our brains are wired to make sure our verbal and nonverbal behaviors match.</p>
<p>It follows that a liar’s nonverbal behavior may accidentally tell the truth.</p>
<p>For instance, they might tell you something didn’t happen, but just barely nod ‘yes’ at the same time.</p>
<p>Or they might give a positive answer but shake their head.</p>
<div id="attachment_90694" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-90694" class="wp-image-90694 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/how-to-organize-your-life-yes-no-hell-yeah.jpg" alt="how to organize your life yes no hell yeah" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/how-to-organize-your-life-yes-no-hell-yeah.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/how-to-organize-your-life-yes-no-hell-yeah-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/how-to-organize-your-life-yes-no-hell-yeah-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-90694" class="wp-caption-text">If their words say one thing but their body says another &#8211; they may be lying.</p></div>
<p>This trick to spot a liar works better if someone is giving you a narrative response rather than a yes or no answer.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that not every culture has the same gestures.</p>
<p>For instance, in Bulgaria and Albania people shake their heads for ‘yes’ and nod for ‘no’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. <a id="4"></a>Fidgeting</h2>
<p>People who are lying tend to fidget. They may fiddle with their hands, clothing, or objects.</p>
<p>A group of Dutch and British researchers used full-body motion capture suits (yes, the same kind used in CGI movies) to detect lying. Each suit contained 17 sensors that registered movement up to 120 times per second.</p>
<p>They found that small movements indicate lying about 60% of the time.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Full-body fidgeting indicates lying 75% of the time.</em> </strong></h4>
<p>When they recorded full-body motion plus individual limb data they got 82% success in predicting lying.</p>
<p>This worked regardless of volunteers’ cultural background, anxiety level, or cognitive load (how hard they were thinking) &#8211; all of which massively affect traditional lie detector tests.</p>
<p>If you're a fidgeter, consider addressing underlying issues (like caffeine dependence or <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/anxiety-and-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">anxiety</a>) that might cause the behavior &#8211; or just work on being more mindful of your body.</p>
<p>This will help you come across as more trustworthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. <a id="5"></a>Freezing</h2>
<p>Not all liars fidget. Some go the other way and freeze.</p>
<p>Lying is difficult and people tend not to move around when they are concentrating on something.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Be wary if a person who has been moving around normally suddenly becomes very still.</em></strong></h4>
<p>A little bit of fidgeting as you speak is better for conveying honesty than going rigid.</p>
<p>Just make sure you don't go too far and come across as nervous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. <a id="6"></a>Touching The Face</h2>
<p>A specific type of fidget that makes it easy to spot a liar is touching the face.</p>
<p>Liars may touch their noses, pick their lips, or tug on their ears. The anxiety of lying makes the blood drain from their face and ears &#8211; which may make them cold or itchy.</p>
<div id="attachment_94848" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94848" class="wp-image-94848 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/face-palm-how-to-spot-a-liar.jpg" alt="Maybe this is why they call a particularly bold lie 'bare-faced'." width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/face-palm-how-to-spot-a-liar.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/face-palm-how-to-spot-a-liar-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/face-palm-how-to-spot-a-liar-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94848" class="wp-caption-text">If someone touches their face consistently as they're trying to convince you, they might be lying.</p></div>
<p>They may also briefly hide their mouth or eyes with their hands.</p>
<p>Some believe this is a subconscious gesture that indicates when someone knows they have something to hide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. <a id="7"></a>Repetition, Repetition, Repetition</h2>
<p>Dr. Lillian Glass, a body language analyst for the FBI, says liars often repeat themselves.</p>
<p>They’re trying to buy time &#8211; and to convince themselves as well as you.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Repeating a lie actually works &#8211; the more times we hear something, the more we tend to believe it. </em></strong></h4>
<p>That’s why advertising uses repetition. Psychologists call it the ‘illusion of truth effect’.</p>
<p>To show honesty &#8211; just say things once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. <a id="8"></a>Trouble Speaking</h2>
<p>Stress can make a liar’s salivary glands produce less saliva &#8211; giving them a dry mouth that makes it hard to speak.</p>
<p>You may notice that they suddenly purse or point their lips.</p>
<p>They’ll also hesitate a lot, say ‘um’ and ‘uh’, and make slips of the tongue as the panic signals in their brain transfer to their body.</p>
<div id="attachment_89676" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89676" class="wp-image-89676 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone.jpg" alt="negative body language fidget with tie phone" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-89676" class="wp-caption-text">You can even detect this one on the phone.</p></div>
<p>Of course, not everyone who's stressed is lying. You can spot a liar by WHEN they get stressed.</p>
<p>If a liar tells you a story in chronological order, try asking them to repeat it in reverse, or ask what they did before one of the things they mentioned.</p>
<p>If they show signs of panic like this &#8211; they’re lying.</p>
<p>So in <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/choking-under-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stressful situations</a>, try to relax and have a drink of water at the ready if you want to come across as honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. <a id="9"></a>Getting Aggressive And Pointing At You</h2>
<p>When people are on the defensive they can get aggressive &#8211; especially when you obviously don’t believe them.</p>
<p>Pointing at you while they speak is an attempt to intimidate you and put the blame on you.</p>
<div id="attachment_89681" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89681" class="wp-image-89681 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-pointing-finger.jpg" alt="negative body language pointing finger" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-pointing-finger.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-pointing-finger-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-pointing-finger-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-89681" class="wp-caption-text">Don't get intimidated by this angry liar.</p></div>
<p>Raising their voice more than normal is also a giveaway. It’s as if they think yelling their words will make them more believable.</p>
<p>If their tone sounds angry or bullying &#8211; they’re probably trying to scare you so that you’re easier to manipulate.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s best to leave the situation for your own safety.</p>
<p>When you're the one getting angry &#8211; no matter how much people annoy you, try to speak calmly and don’t point at them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. <a id="10"></a>Stressed Breathing</h2>
<p>A stressed body will try to get more oxygen to be ready for fight or flight.</p>
<p>Liars most often breathe through their mouths and may breathe more heavily. Their voices may fade out at the end of sentences as they run out of breath.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Stress affects a liar's vocal cords too. </em></strong></h4>
<p>Speech may sound shaky, get quieter or raspier, or change pitch.</p>
<p>These are involuntary physical responses, so the only way to show honesty here is to actually be honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bonus 1: <a id="11"></a>Suddenly Relaxing When You Change The Subject</h2>
<p>If you think you spot a liar displaying these stress behaviors but you’re not sure &#8211; try changing the subject.</p>
<p>A liar will visibly relax as they realize the pressure’s off.</p>
<p>So even if you're really sick of a conversation topic &#8211; it's best not to breathe a visible sigh of relief when someone changes the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bonus 2: You CAN'T Spot A Liar By Where They Look</h2>
<p>You may have heard that liars look to their left while speaking, and people who are telling the truth look to their right.</p>
<p>Nope &#8211; this is bad science.</p>
<p>In 2012 psychologists at the University of Hertfordshire in England actually filmed people lying and telling the truth. They found no correlation between eye movement and honesty.</p>

<p>We'll assume you're starting at Ground Zero. Maybe this is your first suit &#8211; or it's been a decade since you bought a suit but you need one in two weeks for a wedding.</p>
<p>So let's start things off by defining what a suit is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is A Suit?</h2>
<p>A suit is a jacket and a pair of trousers <strong>made of the same material</strong>.</p>
<p>Notice it says &#8216;the same' &#8211; not just similar. A lot of guys make the mistake of trying to palm off a pair of trousers and a similar jacket as a suit.</p>
<p>Don't do it.</p>
<p>Those in the know will notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 1. <a id="1"></a>Choose: Buy A Suit Online Or Offline?</h2>
<p>Your first step is to make a decision: will you buy your suit online or offline? Which is better? That depends on what YOU value.</p>
<h3>Buying A Suit Online</h3>
<p>If you want options, the best selection is always going to be online.</p>
<p>For convenience, nothing beats buying online. You can buy a custom suit at 2 AM in your underwear while drinking a beer.</p>
<div id="attachment_94544" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://ansonbelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94544" class="wp-image-94544 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/buying-a-suit.jpg" alt="buying a suit" width="700" height="674" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94544" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://ansonbelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to discover Anson Belt & Buckle and take advantage of their free U.S. shipping and a lifetime guarantee.</a></p></div>
<h3>Buying A Suit Offline</h3>
<p>If you need a suit quickly &#8211; you're going to need to walk into a store.</p>
<p>If you want customer service, go to a higher-end menswear store &#8211; you can spend 30 minutes with an expert who can identify your body type and which styles and colors will look best on you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 2. <a id="2"></a>Set Your Budget</h2>
<p>For your first suit &#8211; or your first suit in a while &#8211; you want to spend between $200 and $2000.</p>
<p>The real price range of suits is much wider. You can spend $10 in a thrift store or $5000 in Savile Row. But $200-2000 is the happy medium area where most guys can find a great-looking suit.</p>
<div id="attachment_89176" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89176" class="wp-image-89176 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/money.jpg" alt="money" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/money.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/money-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/money-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-89176" class="wp-caption-text">Suit buying rule 2 &#8211; set your budget.</p></div>
<p>Want a more specific number? Budget half your monthly salary &#8211; not just for the suit but for everything that goes with it. That includes the shoes, the shirt and the <a href="https://ansonbelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">belt</a>, which we'll talk about later.</p>
<p>You're going to hear the words &#8216;off the rack', &#8216;custom', and &#8216;bespoke'.</p>
<p>&#8216;Off the rack' means ready-made. That suit's just hanging on a rack waiting for you to buy it. For most people this will work fine &#8211; and you'll find the best deals here.</p>
<p>&#8216;Custom' or &#8216;made to measure' means it's made to fit your measurements out of different pre-cut pieces. This is a great option if you're hard to fit.</p>
<p>&#8216;Bespoke' means it's made from scratch to your exact specifications &#8211; you speak and your tailor listens. For your first suit &#8211; ignore bespoke. Bespoke suits are a work of art, but they're much higher in price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 3. <a id="3"></a>Choose Your Fabric</h2>
<p>If you've got the money, look for a suit in 100% wool &#8211; it's a great indicator of quality.</p>
<p>Because wool is an expensive material, you'll also see blends &#8211; 70%, 50% 0r 30% wool.</p>
<p>Blends aren't necessarily bad &#8211; they'll save you a lot of money. But they are a sign of a lower-end suit &#8211; a manufacturer who uses blends is probably cutting corners elsewhere too.</p>
<p>If you're spending over $500-$1000, you're going to be getting 100% wool, and you're also going to start seeing &#8216;super' wools &#8211; Super 80, Super 100, Super 120, and so on.</p>
<p>There's not a uniform system to these numbers. Every company's &#8216;supers' are different. In general, a higher number means a tighter yarn and therefore a more luxurious drape.</p>
<h4>Any material with &#8216;super' in it will be great quality &#8211; so don't pay extra to get a Super 220 instead of a Super 100.</h4>
<p>Now, what about color? Pick one of three &#8211; navy, charcoal, or gray. No light gray, and no blue &#8211; those are too casual. And no black &#8211; that's for black tie.</p>
<p>A small pattern that's not noticeable is perfectly fine, but avoid noticeable patterns until you're on your third, fourth, or fifth suit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 4. <a id="4"></a>Nail The Fit</h2>
<p>Fit is king. A $50 suit that fits you will look better than a $2000 suit that doesn't. Do not buy a suit that doesn't fit you, unless you know it can be adjusted.</p>
<p>If you have to pay more to get something that fits &#8211; go ahead. If you're unusually tall, short, thin, stout, or muscular, you may have to go custom.</p>
<p>For the rest of you &#8211; here are the specific areas to focus on to get a well-fitted suit off the rack.</p>
<h3>Suit Jacket Shoulders</h3>
<p>Don't buy it if the shoulders don't fit. Adjusting jacket shoulders is like heart surgery &#8211; it's very complicated and very expensive!</p>
<h3>Suit Chest Size</h3>
<p>If you can fit two fists in the front of the jacket, it's way too big. A tailor can bring it in a bit &#8211; but more than two inches will change the proportions and the position of the pockets and the jacket will look bad.</p>
<div id="attachment_61211" style="width: 711px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/suit-fit-quick-guide-vdo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61211" class="wp-image-61211 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/good-bad-fit-suit-.jpg" alt="good bad fit suit" width="701" height="413" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/good-bad-fit-suit-.jpg 701w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/good-bad-fit-suit--300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/good-bad-fit-suit--424x250.jpg 424w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-61211" class="wp-caption-text">Watch for the &#8216;dreaded X' to tell you that a jacket is too tight in the chest.</p></div>
<p>What if it's too tight in the chest? Higher-end suits should have some extra fabric in the seams so a tailor can let it out by about an inch.</p>
<h3>Suit Jacket Length</h3>
<p>Put your arms by your sides. The jacket should reach down to your knuckles, give or take an inch.</p>
<p>At the back &#8211; your jacket should cover your buttocks. It shouldn't be much longer or shorter than that.</p>
<h3>Suit Jacket Sleeves</h3>
<p>Put your arms by your sides again &#8211; the sleeve should go to about your wrist-bone and show a quarter to a half inch of your shirt cuff.</p>
<p>If the sleeves are way off, don't worry. They're one of the easiest things to adjust &#8211; up to an inch and a half, or even two inches on bigger suits.</p>
<h3>Suit Trousers</h3>
<p>Make sure the waist fits you well. If it's slightly too big &#8211; or even slightly too tight &#8211; a tailor can fix that.</p>
<p>Also, pay attention to the hip area. Your tailor may complain about adjusting this &#8211; but if it's way too loose, get it brought in.</p>
<h3>Suit Trouser Break</h3>
<p>When your trousers are longer than your legs, the extra fabric creates a &#8216;break' or fold just above your shoes.</p>
<p>You can choose trousers with no break, a quarter break, a half break, or a full break.</p>
<div id="attachment_94569" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94569" class="wp-image-94569 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/trouser-break.jpg" alt="trouser break" width="700" height="376" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/trouser-break.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/trouser-break-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/trouser-break-450x242.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94569" class="wp-caption-text">Your choice depends on your personal preference and your height. If you're a taller guy you want to go with a full break. If you're a shorter guy go with no break.</p></div>
<p>Again &#8211; fit is king. When you're buying a suit off the rack, the store should have a tailor who'll adjust it for you.</p>
<p>If they charge for this, it's not a bad thing &#8211; you'll often find you get better service because you're paying for it. &#8216;Free' tailor service is probably built into the price of the suit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 5. <a id="5"></a>Choose Function Over Fashion</h2>
<p>You want to create a timeless suit that will serve you six months from now and six years from now &#8211; not a fashion trend that'll be out of style in a year.</p>
<h3>Suit Buttons</h3>
<p>When buying a suit you'll notice there are one, two, three, four, and even five-button suits. Stay away from the ones, fours, and fives.</p>
<p>For 95% of you, the two-button suit will be the best choice. It's a great classic look. If you're taller and want to look a little more formal you can go with three.</p>
<p>Or pick something between the two &#8211; yes, you can actually get a &#8216;two and a half button' suit. This is a three-button suit where the top button is designed to be left undone.</p>
<h3>Suit Lapels</h3>
<p>Your options are notch, peak, and shawl lapels.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-94568 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lapels.jpg" alt="lapel infographic" width="700" height="370" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lapels.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lapels-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lapels-450x238.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Don't touch the shawl lapel &#8211; that's for formal wear.</p>
<p>Peak lapels are more formal than notch lapels. They're fine if you really like the look &#8211; but be aware that they'll grab attention.</p>
<p>Your best bet is the notch lapel. It's not going to win any awards for creativity &#8211; but it's timeless and will still be in style in a decade.</p>
<h3>Jacket Pockets</h3>
<p>Do you want your pockets sewn <em>into</em> your jacket, or on top of your jacket?</p>
<p>The ones sewn on top are known as patch pockets. They're very casual.</p>
<p>For a versatile suit, you should go for pockets that are sewn in and have a flap.</p>
<h3>Jacket Vents</h3>
<p>Vents are the slits in the back of your jacket that give you more room to move. You can choose a single vent, double vent, or no vent.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-94570 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vents.jpg" alt="suits vents infographic" width="700" height="441" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vents.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vents-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vents-397x250.jpg 397w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>No vent is rare &#8211; mostly found in custom and Italian suits. It looks fine if you don't put your hands in your pockets and if you want to create a slimmer profile.</p>
<p>The single vent is the most common and WORST looking of all the vents. Try putting your hand in your pocket with this one &#8211; everyone can see your backside.</p>
<p>The double vent is the best. When you're walking it creates a more streamlined look &#8211; and it's designed not to show your backside even if you're riding a horse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 6. <a id="6"></a>Choose Your Dress Shirt</h2>
<p>Yes &#8211; a suit is a jacket and trousers made from the same material. But it's also everything that goes with it to make you a sharp-dressed man. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link &#8211; so getting details like your shirt wrong can weaken the entire look.</p>
<p>Light blue, pink, and lavender are all acceptable colors for dress shirts &#8211; but classic white is best. It's the most formal, creates the highest contrast, and matches almost anything.</p>
<p>A good fit in the neck area is key because you're going to button it up and wear it with a necktie.</p>
<div id="attachment_72628" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/proper-dress-shirt-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72628" class="wp-image-72628 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/How-Mens-Dress-Shirt-Should-Fit-Collar.jpg" alt="how mens dress shirt should fit collar" width="700" height="397" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/How-Mens-Dress-Shirt-Should-Fit-Collar.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/How-Mens-Dress-Shirt-Should-Fit-Collar-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/How-Mens-Dress-Shirt-Should-Fit-Collar-441x250.jpg 441w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-72628" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/proper-dress-shirt-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A well-fitted shirt collar should allow for two fingers to slip through &#8211; no more, and no less.</a></p></div>
<p>Also, make sure it's got a turn-down collar in a medium spread or a point. Point is the classic collar that works with most necktie knots. If you prefer a wider knot you can go for a medium spread.</p>
<p>Don't go for a wide spread &#8211; that's a more casual style. And definitely avoid button-down collars &#8211; they're way too casual for a suit.</p>
<p>The shirt cuff should be a single button. You can also go for a two-button if you get something custom made. Cufflinks are not recommended for your first suit &#8211; they're more formal and take a bit of attitude to pull off.</p>
<p>And while this may seem obvious &#8211; your dress shirt must always be tucked in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 7. <a id="7"></a>Match Your Shoes With Your Suit</h2>
<p>The classic shoe to get when you're buying a suit is a black Balmoral Oxford.</p>
<p>Oxfords are the most formal shoe style thanks to the sleek simplicity of their closed lacing system. Closed lacing means the front part of the shoe (the vamp) covers the back part (the quarters) &#8211; producing a clean smooth look.</p>
<div id="attachment_93482" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93482" class="wp-image-93482 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dean-oxford.jpg" alt="black oxford" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dean-oxford.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dean-oxford-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dean-oxford-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dean-oxford-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-93482" class="wp-caption-text">The black Balmoral Oxford is the classic complement to a suit.</p></div>
<p>If you want to change it up, a dark brown Oxford is fine &#8211; just a little less formal.</p>
<p>A brown Derby is more casual still because it has an open lacing system (with the quarters on top of the vamp) but you can still pull it off with a suit.</p>
<p>Sneakers with a suit are best reserved for guys with some serious rock star attitude.</p>
<p>Loafers are really too informal for all but the most casual suits. But you can get away with them, especially in the United States at a casual event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 8. <a id="8"></a>Choose Your Neckwear</h2>
<p>Classically a suit is worn with neckwear. You could say it ties the outfit together.</p>
<p>Red is always a safe color (unless it's a bright neon red). You can also go with dark blue or dark green &#8211; or purple, the color of kings.</p>
<p>Stick with plain colors, small repeating patterns such as pin, dot, or regimental stripes. These diagonal stripes were created by the British to represent different clubs and military regiments, and despite being a bold pattern they're formal enough to wear with a suit.</p>
<div id="attachment_94540" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://ansonbelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94540" class="wp-image-94540 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/regimental-tie-with-suit.jpg" alt="regimental tie with suit" width="700" height="700" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94540" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://ansonbelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formal accessories: the regimental tie and slim black dress belt. Click to check out Anson's revolutionary holeless micro-adjustable belt.</a></p></div>
<p>In general bold patterns, bright colors, and knit fabrics make a tie too casual to look right with a suit.</p>
<p>Bow ties are technically just as formal as a long necktie. A bow tie in a solid color won't break the suit rules &#8211; but it will set you apart. It might be fine at a wedding but a little attention-grabbing for a funeral.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 9. <a id="9"></a>Accessorize</h2>
<p>Whatever accessories you wear with a suit &#8211; watches, rings, necklaces, nose piercings, earrings &#8211; keep them restrained unless you're an over-the-top rockstar.</p>
<p>The best watch to wear with a suit is a simple dress watch that just tells you the time, maybe the date, and nothing else. You don't want a lot of complications.</p>
<p>Classic dress watches have a black or dark brown leather strap, but a simple metal band is also fine.</p>
<p>Avoid dive watches that are clearly made to be worn as sport watches &#8211; nothing oversized or gaudy and no rubber straps.</p>
<div id="attachment_92677" style="width: 766px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://ansonbelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92677" class="wp-image-92677 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/anson-belts.jpg" alt="anson belts" width="756" height="443" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/anson-belts.jpg 756w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/anson-belts-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/anson-belts-427x250.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-92677" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://ansonbelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to discover Anson's revolutionary holeless micro-adjustable belt.</a></p></div>
<p>Now, what about belts &#8211; should you or should you not wear a belt with a suit? It depends on your trousers. Do your trousers have belt loops? Then wear a belt.</p>
<p>Try to match the leather of your belt to your shoes and the metal to your other metals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suit Buying Rule 10. <a id="10"></a>Level Up Your Grooming</h2>
<p>Remember a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. So clean and trim your nails. Take care of your skin. Make sure that you shave, or groom your facial hair.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>If you don't shower and your nails are dirty &#8211; you might as well not bother buying a suit. Nobody will think you look good.</strong></h4>
<p>Make sure your hair is well cut and groomed too. Because you're dressing sharp, you can use a hair product with a bit of shine. That's a good look with a suit. But go with whatever works for you &#8211; as long as you take care of that grooming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary: 10 Steps To Buying A Suit With Style</h2>
<p>Now you understand the whole process from start to finish. Follow these ten steps and you'll master the timeless elegance of the suit. Enjoy it&#8230; you're going to feel great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/realmenrealstyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Antonio's Personal Amazon Store</strong></a> &#8211; Shop <strong>all</strong> of my favorite products!</p>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/2W39rzY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>John Henric</strong></a> &#8211; One of my new favorite brands, this Swedish men's clothier skilfully combines luxury and affordability. I particularly like their patterned dress shirts and cotton sweaters.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mizzenandmain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mizzen + Main</strong></a> &#8211; Their claim to fame is the best damn dress shirt but this shirting line includes plenty of casual and short-sleeve options as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://bit.ly/2DO81Eq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rhone</strong></a> &#8211; One of the only sportswear brands to make athleisure looks stylish. Many have tried. Most have failed. This comfortable, high-quality line of athletic apparel is perfect for the gym but believe it or not their <a href="https://www.rhone.com/collections/mens-workout-pants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trousers</a> work well in any casual setting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scottevest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ScottEVest</strong></a> &#8211; It's not rocket science, it's pocket science. Perfect for the dad who's got a lot to carry but wants a more stylish option than cargo shorts, these vests, coats, and shirts have more pockets than you could possibly need pockets brilliantly sewn into them. An excellent choice for a man who loves the outdoors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sheathunderwear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sheath Underwear</strong></a> &#8211; The most comfortable underwear I own. Designed by a marine vet who wanted to keep his goods cool in the extreme heat of the Iraqi desert, these briefs are a must-have in any stylish man's underwear drawer.</p>
<p><a href="https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Suitsupply</strong></a> &#8211; Beyond the custom suit. Fantastic waistcoats (my editor has <a href="https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/waistcoats/light-grey-waistcoat/W180207I.html?cgid=Waistcoats&pdp=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> and loves it!), trousers, shoes, and accessories. Brick and mortar stores all over the world. Customer service at its finest.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailor Store</a></strong> &#8211; Made-to-measure dress shirts with thousands of options when it comes to the fabric and the style. Top-quality, guaranteed to fit. One size only-yours.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.acemarks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ace Marks</strong></a> &#8211; Handcrafted in Italy from the finest leather, Ace Marks are the gold standard when it comes to men's footwear. Perfect for a recent grad who wants a bit more polish in his step.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.allenedmonds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Allen Edmonds</strong></a> &#8211; Another favorite among shoe connoisseurs, including me. AE has more recently branched out into clothing and other accessories but their men's shoes are still top-notch.</p>
<p><a href="https://thursdayboots.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Thursday Boots</strong></a> &#8211; Stylish, rugged boots that will last for centuries. Thursday's goodyear welt construction is the reason why. And now they make shoes!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.undandy.com/?utm_source=Real_Men_Real_Style" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Undandy</strong></a> &#8211; You won't find custom shoes at this price ANYWHERE else.

&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause1"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 1. Overexercising</h2>
<p>Yes, there is such a thing as working out TOO MUCH.</p>
<p>To keep exercise healthy, burning between 2,000 and 3,500 calories each week is ideal.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this.</p>
<div id="attachment_94722" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94722" class="wp-image-94722 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8.jpg" alt="man tired gym" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-8-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94722" class="wp-caption-text">Burning more than 3,500 calories a week can lead to serious issues &#8211; including temporary hair loss.</p></div>
<p>Research has shown that burning beyond 3,500 calories will decrease its health benefits &#8211; such as endorphin production &#8211; and leads to a higher risk of injury.</p>
<p>Exercise will just become a source of physical stress on the body. A 2017 study from the National Medical Library revealed a possible link between overexercise and hair loss in men.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, it's temporary. If you work to recalibrate your routine to be healthier, then expect to see your hair back.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause2"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 2. Using Steroids</h2>
<p>A 2004 Diversion Control Division report revealed a startling statistic&#8230;.</p>
<p>Over 1 million American adults openly reported using steroids. Over 500,000 students from 8th to 10th grade reported doing the same. Most guys know that steroids can be harmful, but did you know it can also cause hair loss in men?</p>
<div id="attachment_94725" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94725" class="wp-image-94725 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/needles.jpeg" alt="steroid needle causes hair loss" width="700" height="420" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/needles.jpeg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/needles-300x180.jpeg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/needles-417x250.jpeg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94725" class="wp-caption-text">To top off the potential dangers of Steroids, they can also cause hair loss.</p></div>
<p>Steroids boost the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body, which helps dramatically accelerate muscle growth.</p>
<p>However, DHT is also directly responsible for hair loss. It binds itself to the receptors in hair follicles, constricting them. This causes them to shrink and die out. It's even WORSE for men who are already genetically prone to balding.</p>
<p>In short: Don't take Steroids, gentlemen.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>Hair Loss Habit 3. Wearing Dirty Headwear</h2>
<p>Unless hats are visibly dirty, guys can forget to wash them on a regular basis &#8211; and that's a mistake.</p>
<p>Like all garments, hats can accumulate dirt, dust, and bacteria through prolonged use. These are then transferred to the scalp &#8211; opening you up to all manner of irritation and scalp infections.</p>
<p>Certain infections &#8211; which we'll see in more detail below &#8211; are prone to causing temporary hair loss in men.</p>
<div id="attachment_94724" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94724" class="wp-image-94724 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-1-1.jpg" alt="hats on display" width="700" height="524" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-1-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-1-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-1-1-334x250.jpg 334w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94724" class="wp-caption-text">Hats can make you look great, but failing to clean them can lead to scalp infections &#8211; which then lead to hair loss.</p></div>
<p>If you wear hats regularly, washing them together with your clothes should prevent the issue altogether.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause4"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 4.  Family History</h2>
<p>This is one that most guys know about, but let's break down the facts and myths surrounding it&#8230;</p>
<p>First thing's first &#8211; fathers can also contribute to their children's hair loss.</p>
<p>Though the primary baldness gene is on the X chromosome &#8211; carried by the mother &#8211; determining a child's potential for balding relies on contributions from 287 genetic regions in total.</p>
<div id="attachment_94555" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94555" class="wp-image-94555 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1.jpg" alt="family day" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-1-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94555" class="wp-caption-text">Just because your mom's free of hair loss doesn't mean you are too. Your dad's genes figure in.</p></div>
<p>Hair loss generally depends on the sensitivity of the hair follicles to androgen &#8211; sex hormones that regulate bodily development in men.</p>
<p>High androgen levels encourage body hair growth while simultaneously causing baldness.</p>
<p>Researchers aren't sure why this happens, but the stronger the androgen &#8211; the more likely you are to lose hair.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause5"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 5. High Stress</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of hair loss in men associated with mental stress:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telogen Effluvium </strong>occurs when stress induces a prolonged &#8220;rest state&#8221; in the hair follicles. After a few months, continual degradation may see hair literally falling off during showers!</li>
<li><strong>Trichotillomania </strong>refers to the insatiable urge by some people to rip out hair from their heads and bodies as a coping mechanism against stress.</li>
<li><strong>Alopecia Areata </strong>is when the immune system reacts to high-stress levels by attacking hair follicles and destroying them.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_94728" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94728" class="wp-image-94728 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress.png" alt="stress levels " width="700" height="344" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress-300x147.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stress-450x221.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94728" class="wp-caption-text">Feeling high-stress levels will lead directly to one of several types of hair loss.</p></div>
<p>So, what are some ways men can mitigate their stress levels so this never happens?</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>A <strong>healthy</strong> exercise routine lowers cortisol &#8211; a stress hormone &#8211; and releases endorphins which help make you happier over time. Endorphins also act as natural painkillers.</p>
<h3>Natural Supplements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lemon balm </strong>is highly regarded for its mint properties, which are proven to mitigate anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids </strong>help reverse stress. A 2011 study published through the US National Library of Medicine found that med students that took these supplements showcased a 20% decrease in anxiety symptoms before an exam.</li>
<li><strong>Green tea</strong> contains polyphenol antioxidants &#8211; proven to lower stress symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping those stress levels in check will help preserve that badass mane!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause6"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 6. The Wrong Hair Styles And Treatments</h2>
<p>Hairstyles that pull your hair back tightly can cause Traction Alopecia &#8211; a kind of hair loss in men caused by excessive pressure on hair follicles.</p>
<p>These include tight ponytails and cornrows.</p>
<p>There are hair treatments that can damage the scalp such as hair relaxer treatments.</p>
<div id="attachment_94729" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94729" class="wp-image-94729 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-2-1.jpg" alt="hair salon and barber shop" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-2-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-2-1-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94729" class="wp-caption-text">Avoid tight hairstyles and damaging hair treatments.</p></div>
<p>These treatments are common for men and women alike who have thick and curly hair. It works by penetrating the cortex layers of the hair shaft to loosen the natural curl.</p>
<p>It has the side effect of making hair brittle and easily breakable &#8211; in some cases, it can even burn the scalp!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, beware of treatments such as this!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause7"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 7. Smoking Excessively</h2>
<p>Adding to the already-extensive list of problems that come with smoking, we have hair loss in men.</p>
<p>Smoke particles attack the hair papilla &#8211; the structure at the very base of the follicle &#8211; and damages the DNA directly.</p>
<p>It also causes an imbalance in the follicular protease & antiprotease, which controls how the skin reacts to hair follicles.</p>
<div id="attachment_94730" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94730" class="wp-image-94730 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smoking.png" alt="smoking and hair loss" width="700" height="408" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smoking.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smoking-300x175.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smoking-429x250.png 429w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94730" class="wp-caption-text">Smoking can seriously mess with your hair follicles. As if you needed more reasons not to do it.</p></div>
<p>Finally, smoking can lead to fibrosis (scarring) over the hair follicles, which guarantees that they'll never grow again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause8"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 8. Unhealthy Eating</h2>
<p>A bad diet can lead to a number of health issues &#8211; One of them being <strong>Iron Deficiency Anaemia</strong>.</p>
<p>It happens when you don't eat enough iron-rich foods such as lentils and spinach.</p>
<p>Iron is crucial for carrying oxygen throughout the body and helping hair growth.</p>
<div id="attachment_94732" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/diet-and-attractiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94732" class="wp-image-94732 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-3-2.jpg" alt="eggs have protein" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-3-2.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-3-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-3-2-376x250.jpg 376w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94732" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/diet-and-attractiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foods like eggs are great sources of protein, which is the primary nutrient in hair. Click here to learn more ways that diet affects attractiveness.</a></p></div>
<p>In general, which foods can you eat to keep your hair healthy?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eggs</strong> are a good source of protein and biotin. Both of these nutrients promote healthy hair growth. Since hair follicles are made mostly of protein, it's essential.</li>
<li><strong>Berries</strong> are full of Vitamin C, which protects hair follicles against free radicals. Vitamin C helps to absorb iron from the foods you eat.</li>
<li><strong>Spinach</strong> &#8211; as mentioned above &#8211; is loaded with folate, iron, and Vitamins A and C. These all keep hair healthy &#8211; Vitamin A helps the skin glance produce sebum, which keeps the scalp moist.</li>
<li><strong>Sweet potatoes</strong> are a solid source of beta-carotene. Your body converts this into Vitamin A.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay on that diet &#8211; your head will thank you!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause9"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 9. Certain Medical Conditions And Treatments</h2>
<p>Let's do a run-through on certain which conditions and treatments hinder hair growth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psoriasis is a common skin condition that often appears on the scalp. It happens when an overactive immune system builds additional skin cells, which results in patches of itchy and dry skin.</li>
<li>Seborrheic Dermatitis creates scales of dry skin which are inflamed and painful to the touch. This occurs when sebum contains more triglycerides and cholesterol than normal, irritating the scalp.</li>
<li>Depression affects over 40 million Americans each year. Unfortunately, it can also lead to more hair loss in men through mental stress.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_94734" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94734" class="wp-image-94734 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-4-1.jpg" alt="itchy scalp hair loss" width="700" height="430" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-4-1.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-4-1-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-4-1-407x250.jpg 407w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94734" class="wp-caption-text">There are plenty of conditions and treatments lead to hair loss. Luckily, most of them are temporary.</p></div>
<p>Fortunately, hair loss that results from these conditions is temporary. For these skin conditions, in particular, medicated shampoo often helps.</p>
<p>What about treatments?</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemotherapy is known to lead to hair loss. It attacks cancer cells, but also other rapidly growing cells &#8211; like hair cells.</li>
<li>Blood Thinners</li>
<li>Amphetamines in the diet.</li>
<li>Drugs which are meant to prevent arthritis.</li>
<li>Thyroid treatments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hair loss in men caused by medications and treatments are known collectively as Telogen Effluvium. It can affect the entire scalp &#8211; beware!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a name="cause10"></a></p>
<h2>Hair Loss Habit 10. Bad Sleeping Habits</h2>
<p>The National Sleep Foundation recommends between 7 and 9 hours of sleep for adults aged 18 through 64.</p>
<p>In the US, however, 40% of people get far less than the recommended amount of sleep.</p>
<p>How does this affect your mane?</p>
<div id="attachment_65802" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65802" class="wp-image-65802 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Antonio-sleep-deprived.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="330" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Antonio-sleep-deprived.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Antonio-sleep-deprived-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Antonio-sleep-deprived-450x212.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-65802" class="wp-caption-text">An unhealthy sleep schedule can have adverse effects on hair growth.</p></div>
<p>Hair is very sensitive to changes in the body. If your sleep quality fluctuates, it can have some adverse effects.</p>
<p>Since sleeping helps regenerate cells, failing to achieve a healthy cycle mitigates healthy hair growth.</p>
<p>So, what can you do to improve the quality of your sleep?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximize white light</strong> (natural light) exposure during the day. This helps your sleep cycle by training your body to stay awake during the day.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize blue light</strong> (screens) exposure at night. Blue light is scientifically proven to reduce your production of melatonin, a hormone that helps you relax and fall asleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get to sleep more AND help keep your hair. What's not to like?</p>
<h2>In Summary &#8211; Hair Loss In Men</h2>
<p>Let's recap the things we covered that can make you lose those amazing locks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Losing more than 3,500 calories a week through <strong><a href="#cause1">overexercising</a>.</strong></li>
<li>Using <strong><a href="#cause2">steroids</a>.</strong></li>
<li>The bacteria in <a href="#cause3"><strong>dirty headwear</strong></a> and subsequent skin infections.</li>
<li><a href="#cause4"><strong>Family history</strong></a> &#8211; this can't be helped much.</li>
<li><a href="#cause5"><strong>Stress</strong> </a>leads to several types of hair loss.</li>
<li><a href="#cause6"><strong>Hairstyles and treatments</strong></a> that strain your scalp.</li>
<li>The adverse effects of <strong><a href="#cause7">smoking</a>.</strong></li>
<li>Having a <strong><a href="#cause8">bad diet</a>.</strong></li>
<li>Certain <strong><a href="#cause9">medical conditions and treatments</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#cause10">Not getting enough sleep</a>.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While some cases like aging and genetics can't be helped, there are plenty of causes of hair loss in men that are preventable.</p>
<p>Take everything in moderation to give your scalp a break!</p>

<p>Bald heads.</p>

<p>Men's reasons for shaving their heads range from hiding hair loss to religious devotion to uniform regulations. But there are a few reasons why every guy should at least consider trying it out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. <a id="association"></a>Association</h2>
<p>The boot camp buzz cut helps recruits feel like part of the team and shift from viewing themselves as nervous civilians to viewing themselves as skilled warriors.</p>
<p>The intimidating precision of Michael Jordan's shaved head felt like an extension of his prowess on the basketball court &#8211; and sparked a boost in the look's popularity.</p>
<div id="attachment_94126" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94126" class="wp-image-94126 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/michael-jordan-shaved-head.jpg" alt="michael jordan shaved head" width="700" height="701" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/michael-jordan-shaved-head.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/michael-jordan-shaved-head-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/michael-jordan-shaved-head-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/michael-jordan-shaved-head-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94126" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Jordan made bald heads cool.</p></div>
<p>When you shave your head you join the ranks of a historic assortment of badasses &#8211; Jordan, Jason Statham, Samuel L. Jackson, The Rock, Vin Diesel, Bruce Willis, Patrick Stewart.</p>
<p>The mental associations that creates for you and the people around you will <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/increase-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">boost your confidence</a> and sense of resilience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. <a id="boldness"></a>Boldness</h2>
<p>A shaved head is a bold style statement.</p>
<p>Sure you could go subtle, cover up the spots where your hair is getting thin, frame your face &#8211; or you could bare it all, at least from the eyebrows up.</p>
<p>Not everybody is going to love your new look right away. You might raise eyebrows at work. Your mother might have a thing or two to say about it.</p>
<div id="attachment_94128" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94128" class="wp-image-94128 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-bald-head.jpg" alt="ihsaan bald head" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-bald-head.jpg 1080w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-bald-head-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-bald-head-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-bald-head-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-bald-head-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94128" class="wp-caption-text">Not everyone is going to love Ihsaan's shaved head. Does he look like he cares?</p></div>
<p>But most people will just be reacting to the shock of change &#8211; and the willingness to embrace change while others cling to the familiar is exactly what makes bald guys stand out. Even if you're aging. ESPECIALLY if you're aging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. <a id="psychology"></a>Deeper Psychology</h2>
<p>A 2012 study out of the Journal of Social Psychological and Personality Science found that the weakest hairstyle a man can have is thinning hair on top &#8211; and the most powerful is a completely bald head.</p>
<p>Bald men were rated as being:</p>
<ul>
<li>13% more dominant</li>
<li>6% more confident</li>
<li>10% more masculine</li>
<li>1 inch taller</li>
<li>13% stronger</li>
<li>Nearly 4 years older</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinning hair can make you feel paranoid about your appearance &#8211; you're constantly worrying about whether people are looking at your spot or whether it's showing. When you shave your head all of that goes away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. <a id="reinvention"></a>Chance For Reinvention</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, shaving your head is a big change. You are going to look and feel very different. And that's a good thing.</p>
<p>The first time you look at your bald self in the mirror, you're going to be looking at a new man.</p>
<p>Any changes you've been wanting to make to your wardrobe, your body, or even your lifestyle are going to get an extra boost because you're making a fresh start.</p>
<p>You'll be able to introduce things to your wardrobe that you might not have explored (or been able to pull off) with hair.</p>
<div id="attachment_94129" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94129" class="size-full wp-image-94129" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-hat.jpg" alt="hat with shaved head" width="700" height="503" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-hat.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-hat-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ihsaan-hat-348x250.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94129" class="wp-caption-text">Shave your head and you have the perfect excuse for a great hat.</p></div>
<p>The most obvious of these is hats &#8211; you'll want to protect your head from sunburn and cold weather, so if you want an excuse to try out different <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/9-classic-hat-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">men's hat styles</a>, this is it.</p>
<p>A bald head tends to draw your attention towards your body. It lends confidence &#8211; but also motivates discipline.</p>
<p>Similar to the hat situation &#8211; if you're looking for the right reason to start running or going to the gym, you've found it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. <a id="facial hair"></a>Shaved Heads And Facial Hair</h2>
<p>A full head of hair acts as a focal point for your face. Know what else can do that job for you? A beard or mustache.</p>
<p>You'll be saving time cutting and styling your hair, so why not get intentional about your beard? Grow it out and start keeping it groomed and styled.</p>
<div id="attachment_89551" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/free-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89551" class="wp-image-89551 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Beard-Guide-2.jpg" alt="Beard Guide" width="330" height="487" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Beard-Guide-2.jpg 330w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Beard-Guide-2-203x300.jpg 203w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/Beard-Guide-2-169x250.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-89551" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/free-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to grab the ultimate beard guide for FREE.</a></p></div>
<p>You can shape the way your face is structured by choosing <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/20-beard-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different types of beards</a>. And the popularity of beards will add to the cool factor of your shaved head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. <a id="maturity"></a>Bonus: Maturity</h2>
<p>If your hair is thinning out, shaving represents a conscious decision to say goodbye to it.</p>
<p>Sure, you could fight the clock &#8211; and that bald spot &#8211; at every turn. But for a lot of guys, it feels more dignified to face the inevitable on their own terms.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Leaving vanity behind and accepting your age is a mature move. </em></strong></h4>
<p>Even if you look older without your hair (and some guys <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/anti-aging-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">look younger</a>) you'll come off as classier and more confident than a man who obviously can't relax about his comb-over.</p>
<p>On top of that, it's a style that says &#8220;I'm not thinking about my hair right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you're old enough to go grey or bald, you've certainly had a journey to get to where you are.</p>
<p>A bold, simple appearance implies a focus on what really matters: your passions, your family, your inner life.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you are more than your youthful appearance &#8211; and you can let that show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. <a id="1"></a>F by Ferragamo Black</h2>
<p>This fragrance is all about fresh liveliness mixed in with the smoky sweetness. One reviewer said:</p>
<h5>&#8220;On the first day that I used this fragrance, I received compliments on how I smelt, how soft it came off as I passed by. My girlfriend absolutely loved this cologne on me.&#8221;</h5>
<div id="attachment_94465" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/salvatore-ferragamo-f-by-ferragamo-black-298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94465" class="wp-image-94465 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ferragamo-black.jpg" alt="f by ferragamo black" width="700" height="700" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94465" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/salvatore-ferragamo-f-by-ferragamo-black-298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to sample this cologne from Scentbird.</a></p></div>
<p>When you think F by Ferragamo Black, you want to think about contrast. On one side you've got a buttoned-up approach &#8211; on the other hand, you've got unbridled confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. <a id="2"></a>Burberry Brit for Men</h2>
<p>This one has notes of rose, orange, tonka bean, nutmeg, cardamom, and cedar wood. When you think about Burberry Brit for Men, what you want to think about is the journey. You start with a subtle citrus note, move into the florals, and finish with the musk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/burberry-burberry-brit-for-men-191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94466 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/burberry-brit.jpg" alt="burberry brit" /></a></p>
<p>It stands out among the best selling men's colognes for its sophistication, but it's also a fragrance that's not going to offend anyone. It's safe for a wide range of occasions and will get compliments from people of many tastes. A reviewer noted:</p>
<h5>&#8220;Not only did my woman love this, but so did everyone else. It's a must-have &#8211; really smells clean, like after a weekend swim at the beach or after a cold fresh shower.&#8221;</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. <a id="3"></a>Robert Graham Courage</h2>
<p>With notes of citron, bergamot, and guaiac wood, the brand describes this fragrance as bottling the experience of driving a car up and down the coast. But it might be more like you've parked the car, and you're out there on the beach. It's clean, relaxed, and woody.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/robert-graham-courage-833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94468 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/best-selling-mens-colognes-courage-1.jpg" alt="best selling mens colognes courage" /></a></p>
<p>A reviewer notes:</p>
<h5>&#8220;Women love it. It's a strong woody and citrus scent that has great balance and smells great &#8211; a scent that can be worn during the day or at night. I always receive compliments while wearing this fragrance.&#8221;</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. <a id="4"></a>English Laundry Oxford Bleu & English Laundry Notting Hill for Men</h2>
<p>In a whiff of Oxford Bleu, you'll pick up green apple, vanilla, mint, tonka bean, lemon, and iris.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/english-laundry-oxford-bleu-477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94469 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/best-selling-mens-colognes-oxford-bleu.jpg" alt="best selling mens colognes oxford bleu" /></a></p>
<p>This is a fresh clean fragrance, and one of the problems with fresh clean fragrances is that they often don't last long. Oxford Bleu does. It's a scent you can apply in the morning and expect to last all day.</p>
<p>Notting Hill for Men opens with cedarwood, then citrus, jasmine, musk, and pepper.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/english-laundry-notting-hill-for-men-647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94470 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/best-selling-mens-colognes-notting-hill.jpg" alt="best selling mens colognes notting hill" /></a></p>
<p>Compared with Oxford Bleu, this is one of the more polarizing of the best selling men's colognes. It's spicy, with the musk and pepper giving an edge to the sweeter, cleaner top notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. <a id="5"></a>Kenneth Cole Black Bold</h2>
<p>With notes of suede, basil, ginger, incense, violet leaf, and lotus, this fragrance is meant to invoke the feeling of being in New York City &#8211; putting yourself out there, going after your dreams, being in a place where everyone's hustling and trying to make it happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/kenneth-cole-black-bold-574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94472 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/black-bold.jpg" alt="kenneth cole black bold" /></a></p>
<p>Strength, power, confidence, intensity &#8211; that's this fragrance. And what do people have to say about it? This amateur poet writes:</p>
<h5>&#8220;Solid clean scent &#8211; smells great, not too intense, so a good cologne for work or when you want to wear all black. Bold enough to make you feel like you can take down a lion, but soft enough to cherish the lioness.&#8221;</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. <a id="6"></a>Dolce & Gabbana The One</h2>
<p>Notes represented here include amber, tobacco, ginger, grapefruit, cardamom, and orange blossom.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/dolce-gabbana-the-one-for-men-217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94473 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/best-selling-mens-colognes-the-one.jpg" alt="best selling mens colognes the one" /></a></p>
<p>It's what fragrance enthusiasts call an &#8216;oriental' fragrance &#8211; which implies that it's spicy and a bit intense. This isn't one to overuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. <a id="7"></a>Tommy Bahama Maritime For Him</h2>
<p>The notes here are bergamot, lavender, pink pepper, clary sage, cedarwood, and jasmine.</p>
<p>This fragrance is all about fresh clean air &#8211; imagine you're out on a boat breathing in that great smell.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/tommy-bahama-maritime-for-him-648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94474 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tommy-bahama-maritime.jpg" alt="tommy bahama maritime" /></a></p>
<p>You'll notice that this has a wide variety of notes &#8211; it's a complex fragrance, but none of the elements is overpowering. It all blends into a simple clean scent that people love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. <a id="8"></a>Bvlgari Aqva</h2>
<p>With notes of seaweed, mandarin, orange, cedarwood, petitgrain, and lavender, this is another aquatic scent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/bvlgari-bvlgari-aqva-194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94475 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/best-selling-mens-colognes-bvlgari-aqva.jpg" alt="best selling mens colognes bvlgari aqva" /></a></p>
<p>The popularity of aquatic scents among the best selling men's colognes should tell you that these type of fragrances rock. People want to smell clean.</p>
<p>This is something we're naturally attracted to &#8211; it comes off as healthy and invigorating. One reviewer says:</p>
<h5>&#8220;Very refreshing and noticeable &#8211; a calm non-overpowering scent, really enjoyable. As soon as my wife smelt this she said, &#8216;Oh yeah!' As for me, I too loved the crisp clean scent. It's a summer-type cologne, and it lasts a long time.&#8221;</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. <a id="9"></a>Versace Eros</h2>
<p>This fragrance is amazing &#8211; a delicious blend of vanilla, mint, tonka bean, green apple, lemon, and ambroxan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/versace-eros-268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-93749 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-3-1.jpg" alt="Versace Eros" /></a></p>
<p>Named after Eros, the god of love, this one lives up to its name &#8211; it's all about passion. This is a very alluring fragrance. If you're looking for something to attract the ladies &#8211; check out Versace Eros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. <a id="10"></a>Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue</h2>
<p>The notes here are a clever combination of grapefruit, bergamot, pepper, mandarin orange, rosemary, and Brazilian rosewood.</p>
<p>Light Blue is notable among the best selling men's colognes for its cult following &#8211; when you smell it you'll understand why.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/dolce-gabbana-light-blue-563320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94476 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/best-selling-mens-colognes-light-blue.jpg" alt="best selling mens colognes light blue" /></a></p>
<p>This is an impressive fragrance that should be in every man's wardrobe. Here's what they're saying in the reviews:</p>
<h5>&#8220;A perfect go-to for any occasion. Not too loud, but strong enough for the ladies when they get a whiff when I walk by. It's such a relaxed and clean smell that I forget I have it on until people compliment me.&#8221;</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bonus: <a id="11"></a>Roja Elysium</h2>
<p>This one's not as common &#8211; but looks set to become a classic in the next decade.</p>
<p>It's a complex fragrance, with citrusy top notes of grapefruit, lime, lemon, bergamot, and musk that fade into a floral heart of light rose and jasmine. It's also got hints of vetiver, cedar, and pink pepper.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scentbird.com/perfume/roja-parfums-elysium-pour-homme-1035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-94477 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/best-selling-mens-colognes-roja-elysium.jpg" alt="best selling mens colognes roja elysium" /></a></p>
<p>If you don't want to wear the fragrances that everyone else is wearing, and you'd rather try something daring &#8211; check out Roja Elysium.</p>
<p>It's attracting rave reviews, many saying nobody makes fragrances like this anymore. Here's one:</p>
<h5>&#8220;When you first spray it on, you're going to get this Holy Grail of citrus. I've been wearing this fragrance for a week, and I've been receiving overwhelming positive attention. The projection is fantastic for like the first two hours, and at the five-hour mark it sits very closely to the skin, becoming an intimate scent. The versatility of this fragrance is fantastic.&#8221;</h5>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The alarm rings, the coffee brews.</p>
<p>In a blur you're in and out of the shower, dressed and on your way to work.</p>
<p>You're definitely in a hurry and maybe already late. And the whole time, you're on autopilot.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The reason so many men dread mornings is that they just let them happen, instead of being deliberate about what they want from them.</p>
<p>Attention to just a few details can make a world of difference. Read on for the morning routine habits that will change your whole day.</p>

<h2>1. <a id="1"></a>Make Time For Breakfast</h2>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you've heard this before &#8211; study after study has proved that eating breakfast improves working memory and cognitive performance.</p>
<p>But there's another important benefit of breakfast that you might be missing.</p>
<p>That benefit is enjoyment. Making time for breakfast slows down a hectic morning.</p>
<div id="attachment_94200" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94200" class="wp-image-94200 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/healthy-breakfast.jpg" alt="healthy-breakfast" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/healthy-breakfast.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/healthy-breakfast-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/healthy-breakfast-375x250.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94200" class="wp-caption-text">Breakfast is one of the most vital morning routine habits.</p></div>
<p>If you're married or live with a partner, or you have kids, it can be time that you spend with loved ones when all of you are fresh from a night's sleep &#8211; highly quality time, in other words.</p>
<p>Even if you're alone, a Swedish study showed that people get more nutrients when they enjoy their food.</p>
<p>Given the same vitamins and minerals in a tasteless puree and a delicious meal, subjects who got the meal absorbed more by a significant margin.</p>
<p>So savor breakfast, and get the most out of the most important meal of the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. <a id="2"></a>Dress Well</h2>
<p>If you don't feel like you have enough time in the morning to dress well, you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>To begin with the obvious: choosing and preparing your outfit should not be one of your morning routine habits. It should be part of your evening routine.</p>
<p>But you can also streamline your planning process.</p>
<div id="attachment_91196" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/build-interchangeable-wardrobe/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91196" class="wp-image-91196 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/16-piece-interchangeable-wardrobe.jpg" alt="16 piece interchangeable wardrobe" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/16-piece-interchangeable-wardrobe.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/16-piece-interchangeable-wardrobe-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/16-piece-interchangeable-wardrobe-445x250.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-91196" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/build-interchangeable-wardrobe/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Click here to create an interchangeable wardrobe that makes getting dressed a no-brainer.</a></p></div>
<p>Store your shirts with coordinated ties on the same hanger, and your jackets with pocket squares pre-placed so you don't have to fuss with them.</p>
<p>And if you haven't already <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/purge-your-closet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">purged your wardrobe</a> and made it interchangeable, do it now. Dressing sharp is a habit just like any other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="3"></a>3. Make Exercise A Morning Routine Habit</h2>
<p>Studies show that working out first thing in the morning can help you stay focused, eat healthier, and be more active all day long &#8211; and even sleep better the next night.</p>
<p>But let's be honest &#8211; when your alarm rings in the pre-dawn cold and darkness, the last thing you want to do is leave your cozy cocoon and hit the gym.</p>
<p>Maybe you've written yourself off as too unmotivated to reap the rewards of an early workout.</p>
<div id="attachment_33461" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33461" class="wp-image-33461 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Rower-gym-e1453992368126.jpg" alt="Man Working Out At the Gym" width="700" height="330" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Rower-gym-e1453992368126.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Rower-gym-e1453992368126-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Rower-gym-e1453992368126-450x212.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-33461" class="wp-caption-text">Can't drag yourself to the gym before work? Don't worry &#8211; there's a solution.</p></div>
<p>The good news is that motivation is easy to hack. Try getting out of bed and doing a single push-up &#8211; just one.</p>
<p>The next day, do two. The following day, three &#8211; and just keep building until you're doing fifteen or twenty. Then add reps of other exercises.</p>
<p>This approach is known as kaizen, a word that literally means &#8220;improvement&#8221; but which Japanese businesses use to refer to the practice of leveling up just a little bit each day over a period of time.</p>
<p>Of course, a hardcore strength workout isn't right for everybody, but a little movement of any kind is immensely beneficial.</p>
<p>If you don't want to work out formally, try just going for a walk outside after breakfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. <a id="4"></a>Give Yourself Time To Enjoy Your Shave</h2>
<p>Your grooming routine can be something you sleep through &#8211; but it can also be something that actively improves your day.</p>
<p>Take shaving for instance.</p>
<p>If you're intentional about it &#8211; choosing a quality razor and products you really like, honing your technique &#8211; it can feel like you've really accomplished something before you've even sat down to work.</p>
<div id="attachment_94201" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94201" class="wp-image-94201 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/morning-routine-habits-oneblade.jpg" alt="morning routine habits oneblade" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/morning-routine-habits-oneblade.jpg 600w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/morning-routine-habits-oneblade-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/morning-routine-habits-oneblade-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/morning-routine-habits-oneblade-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94201" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://bit.ly/onbl_rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For shaving products you'll LOVE &#8211; click here to check out OneBlade and use code DETAILS to claim your discounted Black Tie Kit.</a></p></div>
<p>Experiment with different types of razors, soaps, and aftershaves. It's a sensory experience and it can be an opportunity to treat your senses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. <a id="5"></a>Create Some Headspace</h2>
<p>Another morning routine habit you shouldn't be without is time alone with your thoughts.</p>
<p>This doesn't have to be an hour-long meditation session (although it can be), but a few mindful moments can make a world of difference in the day ahead of you.</p>
<p>Focus and take stock of how you feel and what you're experiencing at this moment of your life through meditation, contemplation, journaling, or all of the above.</p>
<div id="attachment_93223" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93223" class="wp-image-93223" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/morning-coffee.jpg" alt="morning coffee" width="700" height="446" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/morning-coffee.jpg 817w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/morning-coffee-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/morning-coffee-768x489.jpg 768w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/morning-coffee-393x250.jpg 393w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-93223" class="wp-caption-text">Use your journal to clear your head and set your intentions for the day.</p></div>
<p>Once you're centered, plan your day in a way that works for you, making sure you take time to do so with a calm outlook.</p>
<p>You may want to spend some time reading great literature or doing another activity you find fulfilling as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. <a id="6"></a>Practice Gratitude In Your Morning Routine</h2>
<p>In the hectic everyday, it can be easy to overlook the positive.</p>
<p>Taking time in your morning for gratitude is an antidote to that tendency &#8211; and to burnout and feelings of purposelessness.</p>
<p>Here's one idea for incorporating gratitude into your morning routine habits: during your commute, call somebody who's been an inspiration to you.</p>
<div id="attachment_91939" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91939" class="wp-image-91939 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/phone-call-e1556653370918.jpeg" alt="phone call" width="700" height="284" /><p id="caption-attachment-91939" class="wp-caption-text">Who helped to make you the man you are? Give them a call and thank them.</p></div>
<p>It could be your mom, your high school football coach, an older colleague, anyone.</p>
<p>Ask them what's up and thank them for being an inspiration. Tell them about their contributions, both to your life and in general.</p>
<p>Motivating others will make you feel amazing too, and it sets a great tone for the coming day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Counting down from five, let’s get started.</p>
<h2>5. <a id="5"></a>Hand-Painted Oxford Brogues</h2>
<p>Comfortable with your plain brown shoes?</p>
<p>We all recognize the classic Oxford brogue and its origins &#8211; the shoe shape coming from rebellious Oxford University students anxious to ditch boots in the 19th century, the brogues from Scots who needed to get through bogs with breathable footwear.</p>
<p>It’s time to take it up a notch. Hand-painted brogues yield a uniquely rugged finish. These custom made men's shoes will serve the artistically-inclined among you well.</p>
<div id="attachment_94103" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/shoes/15-by-powell-oxford-half-brogue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94103" class="wp-image-94103 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19.jpg" alt="undandy handpainted brown oxford" width="700" height="662" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-300x284.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-19-264x250.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94103" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/shoes/15-by-powell-oxford-half-brogue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out these hand-painted Oxfords at Undandy.</a></p></div>
<p>Their outward aggression is tempered by their adherence to what makes a classic oxford great. The broguing and silhouette are unchanged.</p>
<p>It’s a great way to step out of your comfort zone without taking a leap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. <a id="4"></a>Leather Tennis Shoes</h2>
<p>If you want to combine sneakers and classic style, these shoes are the way to go. Dress sneakers are ideal for wearing in an ultra-casual setting where you still want to send a message of style.</p>
<p>If you want to opt for an even dressier look, some dress sneakers even come with broguing &#8211; snazzy, huh?</p>
<div id="attachment_94104" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/sneakers/92-by-wayne-patina-oxford-sneaker-brogue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94104" class="wp-image-94104 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8982bdf91b896e239658ed02f48d1104.png" alt="undandy leather tennis shoes" width="700" height="418" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8982bdf91b896e239658ed02f48d1104.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8982bdf91b896e239658ed02f48d1104-300x179.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8982bdf91b896e239658ed02f48d1104-419x250.png 419w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94104" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/sneakers/92-by-wayne-patina-oxford-sneaker-brogue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Want these shoes for yourself? Check them out at Undandy.</a></p></div>
<p>Pair it with a bold color &#8211; a blue patina is sure to draw eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. <a id="3"></a>Double Monk Strap Dress Boots</h2>
<p>These shoes go back to the 15th century when monks sought a way to make their daily toils a bit easier. The monk strap was the result. Though they started with a single buckle, double monk straps are common in modern iterations.</p>
<p>What happens when you combine monk straps with dress boots?</p>
<p>The result isn’t the Frankenstein of shoes as you’d imagine, but something astonishing that leaves most other shoes in the dust.</p>
<p>These monk strap boots make for a robust counterpart to the finer elegance often associated with the classic variant.</p>
<div id="attachment_94105" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/boots/15-by-eric-monkstrap-boot-wholecut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94105" class="wp-image-94105 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/03705c543ad7176a3cdfc3ca5972b39b.png" alt="undandy double monk strap" width="700" height="324" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/03705c543ad7176a3cdfc3ca5972b39b.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/03705c543ad7176a3cdfc3ca5972b39b-300x139.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/03705c543ad7176a3cdfc3ca5972b39b-450x208.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94105" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/boots/15-by-eric-monkstrap-boot-wholecut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out these gorgeous double monk strap boots by Undandy.</a></p></div>
<p>Want to go crazy? Try a brightly-colored suede such as green on these custom made men's shoes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. <a id="2"></a>The '48 By Rhett Butler</h2>
<p>We’re going back to the old-school Oxford silhouette with these, but that doesn’t make them boring by any means.</p>
<p>These double monk strap leather dress shoes sport a two-toned look in brown and green, and with full broguing to boot.</p>
<div id="attachment_94108" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/shoes/48-by-rhett-butler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94108" class="wp-image-94108 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-22.jpg" alt="undandy double monk strap" width="700" height="417" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-22.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-22-300x179.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-22-420x250.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94108" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/shoes/48-by-rhett-butler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out these shoes for yourself at Undandy.</a></p></div>
<p>The design skillfully blends three separate features of casualwear without being ostentatious. In fact, it’s flattering &#8211; loud enough to command the attention of a room, but subtle enough to wear anywhere (outside of the office of course).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. <a id="1"></a>The '48 By Holden Caufield</h2>
<p>Most guys are familiar with the classic Chelsea boot. This beauty began as a 19th-century British riding boot. The signature elastic band served to make it easy to slip on. Since then, it's evolved into a casual menswear staple.</p>
<p>This brilliant design takes the classic Chelsea boot to the next level. It’s no wonder why it’s number one on our list.</p>
<div id="attachment_94110" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/boots/48-by-holden-caulfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94110" class="wp-image-94110 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-23.jpg" alt="undandy chelsea boots" width="700" height="490" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-23.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-23-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-23-357x250.jpg 357w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-94110" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.undandy.com/us/shoe-types/boots/48-by-holden-caulfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to get your very own Chelseas from Undandy.</a></p></div>
<p>They come in black leather for a more formal look but are accented beautifully by bright green on the elastic strips on the sides and yellow lining. Full broguing is the cherry on the cake on these custom made men's shoes.</p>
<p>Need to let everyone know you want to push the envelope on elegance? Look no further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. Linen Shirts</h2>
<p>Linen has a long history. The ancient Mesopotamians used it to denote men of status. In Egypt, it was even used as a currency due to its perceived value.</p>
<p>But what is it?</p>
<p>Linen is a light and breathable fabric made from the fibers of the flax plant. The flax is commonly hand-harvested in order to gather the longest fibers possible.</p>
<div id="attachment_93970" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93970" class="wp-image-93970 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c311a937cdbf6c2c01b2851f5f1868e8.png" alt="tailor store royal blue linen" width="700" height="545" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c311a937cdbf6c2c01b2851f5f1868e8.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c311a937cdbf6c2c01b2851f5f1868e8-300x234.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c311a937cdbf6c2c01b2851f5f1868e8-321x250.png 321w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-93970" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out the linen shirts at Tailor Store.</a></p></div>
<p>Just like the ancients, modern men love it for its utility in hot weather.</p>
<p>Choose a simple design &#8211; a solid-colored shirt with no modifications such as epaulets or pockets.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are practical; linen is notoriously prone to wrinkles. Lighter weaves might fold if you so much as stare intensely.</p>
<p>The darker the color &#8211; the less noticeable those wrinkles will be. Furthermore, a simple shirt will be easier to iron and maintain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, men's summer shirts made with linen are a timeless and stylish way to stay fresh under the sun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Broadcloth And Poplin Shirts</h2>
<p>First things first &#8211; what are broadcloth and poplin?</p>
<p>Trick question &#8211; they're the same (but we'll call it broadcloth).</p>
<p>It's a smooth, light and untextured cotton fabric whose thread weave ranges from 50 singles to 140 (or more) doubles.</p>
<p>Broadcloth is the single most versatile fabric out there, as it appears on both formal and casual menswear.</p>
<div id="attachment_93972" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93972" class="wp-image-93972 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c8ef23afe75bb1877682792c486b3194.png" alt="tailor store checked shirt" width="700" height="485" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c8ef23afe75bb1877682792c486b3194.png 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c8ef23afe75bb1877682792c486b3194-300x208.png 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c8ef23afe75bb1877682792c486b3194-361x250.png 361w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-93972" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to browse the checked shirts at Tailor Store.</a></p></div>
<h3>Overview Of Checked Patterns:</h3>
<p>Now let's talk patterns. The summer is a great time to experiment with checked patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gingham</strong> is a good way to start &#8211; it's popular for casual shirts. The pattern consists of tightly-crossing lines of various colors (see the image above).</li>
<li><strong>Madras </strong>is a little wilder and ultra-casual, with unlimited combinations of colors.</li>
<li><strong>Tartan </strong>originates from Scotland in the 1700s and resembles the iconic kilt. Though it's usually made for wool and flannel, it's also commonly found on cotton.</li>
<li><strong>Tattersall</strong> is a tamer pattern of vertical and horizontal lines, usually in two colors on a light background.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about colors? Stick with white on the background, but experiment with pastel colors on the stripes.</p>
<p>Yellows and blues are also safe summer-themed colors to wear with these summer men's shirts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Boldly-Patterned Shirts</h2>
<p>The summer months are the time to be aggressive when it comes to patterns. Try these to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paisley </strong>was originally a Zoroastrian motif from the Persian-Sasanian Empire. Nowadays it's common on ties and pocket squares. Who says it can't be on a shirt too?</li>
<li><strong>Floral </strong>patterns were first invented by the Chinese, who printed peony flowers on garments. These patterns are pretty common on ultra-casual menswear.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_93974" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93974" class="wp-image-93974 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-16.jpg" alt="tailor store paisley shirt" width="700" height="624" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-16.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-16-300x267.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Webp.net-compress-image-16-280x250.jpg 280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-93974" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to shop for paisley shirts at Tailor Store.</a></p></div>
<p>Balance bold patterns with a subtle color contrast such as two different shades of gray or blue.</p>
<p>Pairing paisley or florals with solid dark-colored trousers will make for a slim and monochromatic look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Short Sleeved Button-Down</h2>
<p>Shirts with short sleeves are generally great for casual wear, but they're especially effective as summer shirts.</p>
<p>Here are a few <strong>guidelines</strong> to look your best:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't tuck it in. It's meant to be casual.</li>
<li>Don't wear a necktie with it, or you'll look like you work in a cubicle.</li>
<li>Wear with solid pants if you're going for patterns.</li>
<li>You can add some edge by rolling up the sleeves a little more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Short sleeved summer shirts are ideal in broadcloth or linen. </strong></em></h4>
<p>Short sleeves suit muscular men best. However, those of you with a slimmer build can do just as well if you pay attention to the fit.</p>
<p>The shoulder seams shouldn't extend beyond the bone at the end of your shoulder where the arm begins.</p>
<p>As far as width is concerned you shouldn't be able to pinch more than a half-inch of fabric.</p>
<p>The length should fall roughly between your shoulder and elbow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Lightweight Chambray Fabric</h2>
<p>Like broadcloth, chambray is perfect for the summer. It's a linen-finished cloth with a white weft and colored warp, making a faintly streaky appearance.</p>
<p>Chambray has a history dating back to the French town of Cambrai in the mid-1500s.</p>
<p>The original <strong>&#8220;cambric&#8221;</strong> was a linen fabric used for everything from handkerchiefs to shirts. It started being referred to as chambray by the British in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Chambray is often confused with denim, but the former uses a plain weave construction and is significantly lighter and breathable.</p>
<div id="attachment_22920" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22920" class="wp-image-22920 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Chambray-e1557172579625.jpg" alt="chambray fabric summer shirts" width="700" height="394" /><p id="caption-attachment-22920" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out TailorStore's range of chambray fabric summer shirts!</a></p></div>
<p>Like denim, however, it traditionally comes in various hues of blue. It's a solid choice for a men's summer shirt.</p>
<h2>6. Classic Polo Shirt</h2>
<p>You'd be hard-pressed to find a man who isn't familiar with Polo shirts.</p>
<p>This widespread garment goes back to the 19th century British Raj, when army officers started using it as a uniform to play the sport from which it derives its name.</p>
<p>The polo is a collared shirt with only two or three buttons (though more are common on golf-style shirts). They come in short and long sleeved variants and the short sleeves are ideal for men's summer shirts.</p>
<p>100% cotton is the staple, but they're commonly sold with synthetic fibers.</p>
<div id="attachment_92264" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/5-outfits-polo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92264" class="wp-image-92264 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/young-mens-style-polo.jpg" alt="young mens style polo" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/young-mens-style-polo.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/young-mens-style-polo-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/young-mens-style-polo-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-92264" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/5-outfits-polo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to learn more about wearing polos.</a></p></div>
<p>What about length? The bottom shouldn't go more than halfway down your fly and back pocket, and certainly shouldn't be higher than your belt.</p>
<p>The shorter sleeves should run halfway to two-thirds of the way down your biceps.</p>
<p>It's meant to be untucked, but you can always tuck it in with chinos for a slightly dressier look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Band Collar Shirts</h2>
<p>When it comes to easy-going men's summer shirts, none encapsulate the classy beachside gentleman quite like a band collar.</p>
<p>This shirt surrounds the neck with a standing collar which doesn't turn over into a collar &#8220;cape.&#8221; It usually extends no more than two inches so as not to jab into the wearer's neck.</p>
<div id="attachment_93979" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93979" class="wp-image-93979 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/b35a51e76f617ecf6fec31075f9a32c4.jpg" alt="tailor store men's summer shirts band collar" width="700" height="401" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/b35a51e76f617ecf6fec31075f9a32c4.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/b35a51e76f617ecf6fec31075f9a32c4-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/b35a51e76f617ecf6fec31075f9a32c4-436x250.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-93979" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://tailorstore.com/rmrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to create a fitted band collar shirt with Tailor Store.</a></p></div>
<p>Try this fun shirt in cotton &#8211; or in linen for a more relaxed summer aesthetic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary &#8211; Men's Summer Shirts</h2>
<p>Let's do a quick review:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wear simple and dark linen shirts.</strong> Linen is a luxury fabric that is breathable as well as stylish but beware of wrinkles!</li>
<li><strong>Use broadcloth checked shirts </strong>to experiment with bright summer-themed colors.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've ever tried to sound smart by using certain phrases, bad news &#8211; you may have had the opposite effect.</p>
<p>A 2005 study &#8211; aptly named &#8220;Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems With Using Long Words Needlessly&#8221; &#8211; showed that when someone used overly complicated words, people's opinion of them dropped.</p>
<p>So what kind of words cause a negative impression? Here are a few common ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#1">Plethora</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#2">Actually</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#3">Honestly</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#4">No Offense</a></strong></li>

<h2>Stupid Phrase 1. <a id="1"></a>Plethora</h2>
<p>Do you have a plethora of piñatas? Do you know what plethora means?</p>
<p>If you don't, don't worry. Neither did Jefe in the classic movie <em>The Three Amigos</em>. It's a complex and relatively rarely-used word &#8211; people often misapply it because they assume they know the meaning based on context.</p>
<div id="attachment_94448" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94448" class="wp-image-94448 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrase-plethora-of-pinatas.jpg" alt="phrase plethora of pinatas" width="700" height="438" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrase-plethora-of-pinatas.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrase-plethora-of-pinatas-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrase-plethora-of-pinatas-400x250.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94448" class="wp-caption-text">A plethora of piñatas: we're talking at least this many.</p></div>
<p>For the record, it means a notable excess of something — not a wide variety, and not just a bunch. You're welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. <a id="2"></a>Actually</h2>
<p>The problem here is that when you use this at the beginning of a response to somebody, it makes it sound like you're criticizing them, being defensive, or <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/how-to-be-successful/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">making excuses</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine if one of your coworkers asks you, “Hey, are you ready to get started working on that project?” What's the feeling you convey when you say “actually, I'm not”? It sounds more defensive than a simple “no, I'm not ready.”</p>
<div id="attachment_52684" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-52684" class="wp-image-52684 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/talk-less.jpg" alt="stop saying this" width="700" height="433" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/talk-less.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/talk-less-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/talk-less-404x250.jpg 404w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-52684" class="wp-caption-text">Actually stop saying this.</p></div>
<p>The bottom line is that it isn't necessary &#8211; and the vibe it gives off is often unintentionally negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. <a id="3"></a>Honestly</h2>
<p>Think about it. If you have to state that you are <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/attractiveness-and-honesty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">being honest</a> this one time, what does that say about everything else you've said?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Are you saying that up till now you've been lying?</em></strong></h4>
<p>Also watch out for &#8220;to be honest&#8221; and &#8220;to tell you the truth.&#8221; Often, we put these phrases in without even thinking about what they're implying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. <a id="4"></a>No Offense</h2>
<p>When you hear no offense, what do you think is going to come next? You know that person is going to <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/offend-people/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">offend you</a>.</p>
<p>At the very least, they're going to say something critical, disagree with you, or tell you something you don't want to hear.</p>
<p>When you hear that phrase, you tighten up. You set up your defenses. Even if what follows needs to be said, your audience is suddenly less receptive to it.</p>
<div id="attachment_89676" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89676" class="wp-image-89676 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone.jpg" alt="negative body language fidget with tie phone" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/negative-body-language-fidget-with-tie-phone-450x225.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-89676" class="wp-caption-text">No offense? Uh oh&#8230; this is gonna be offensive.</p></div>
<p>Another issue with &#8220;no offense&#8221; is that you often hear it said before publicly criticizing someone. This is a failure of leadership. You're relying on social shame to change the person's behavior or approach, rather than working with them to get the needed results.</p>
<p>Alternatives might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have concerns.</li>
<li>Can we talk about this?</li>
<li>Are you open to feedback?</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot better &#8211; and it's a lot more direct than starting it off with &#8220;no offense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. <a id="5"></a>Just Sayin’</h2>
<p>Thank you for clarifying that you said what you just said and that you let me know that you just said it.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>What's the point of saying &#8220;just saying&#8221;?</em></strong></h4>
<p>Maybe there's a little bit of emotion that you're trying to get across with this phrase — pointing out that &#8216;I'm removed from this. Don't blame me.' The point is what you're saying makes no sense.</p>
<p>Just sayin’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. <a id="6"></a>Like/Uhh</h2>
<p>&#8220;Like,&#8221; similar to &#8220;uh&#8221; and &#8220;um,&#8221; is a <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/public-speaking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">filler word</a>. Filler words have an upside: a 2014 study out of the University of Texas found that their use can correlate with conscientiousness in conversation, as well as with intelligence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people still associate it with stereotypical &#8220;valley girl&#8221; talk. Even the University of Texas study noted that it's used most among women and teenagers, which can lead to people being judgemental of adult men who do the same.</p>
<div id="attachment_94444" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94444" class="wp-image-94444 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cher-horowitz.jpg" alt="cher horowitz" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cher-horowitz.jpg 640w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cher-horowitz-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cher-horowitz-444x250.jpg 444w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-94444" class="wp-caption-text">People won't like it if you sound like Cher from &#8216;Clueless'.</p></div>
<p>Filler words essentially give you time to think before you speak &#8211; so if you're trying to cut back, remember that it's okay to talk a little bit slower. It's better for you to KNOW what to say by slowing down than filling the space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. <a id="7"></a>Irregardless</h2>
<p>It may be in the dictionary somewhere, but come on &#8211; it's not a real word.</p>
<p>What you probably need to say is regardless, and that's what you should say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. <a id="8"></a>Literally, Actually and Basically</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about the words “literally”, &#8220;actually&#8221; and “basically.”</p>
<p>These are intensifiers. We use them to add emphasis to what we're saying.</p>
<p>It isn't so much technical incorrectness (literally has been used&#8230; um&#8230; non-literally as an intensifier since the 1700s, and it's not going away) as it is repetition that makes &#8220;literally&#8221; such an annoying word.</p>
<p>So if &#8220;literally&#8221; is the word you default to, give more thought to how it sounds in a given context.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>If you say &#8216;I'm literally asleep'&#8230; are you talking in your sleep?</em></strong></h4>
<p>We use &#8220;actually&#8221; a lot too, but what we are saying is that whatever we are talking about is 100% true. Did you actually have the best night ever? Or are you just trying to emphasize that it was a really good night?</p>
<p>And a lot of people default to saying &#8220;basically&#8221; at the beginning of their sentences &#8211; but why? If you're explaining things in basic terms, do you need to point out that you're going to explain them in basic terms?</p>
<p>And if you’re saying it because you don't know what to say &#8211; it makes you look nervous and unsure of yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. <a id="9"></a>I Personally</h2>
<p>I personally make this mistake all the time. Why do I need to state that I'm personally saying something &#8211; who else are you going to think is saying it?</p>
<p>Again, it's one of those phrases we use as defaults to fill space.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>If you're looking to improve your use of language &#8211; the best trick is to record yourself.</em></strong></h4>
<p>Slow down, think, find small areas that you can improve, and then practice. That's all it takes to master the language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="10"></a>10. Could Care Less</h2>
<p>Have you ever used the phrase “could care less”?</p>
<p>What you meant to say is &#8220;couldn't care less.&#8221;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>If you say you COULD care less &#8211; that implies that you do care a little.</em></strong></h4>
<p>What you're trying to say is that you don't care &#8211; not at all. None. You couldn't care less.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you're saying the right thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="11"></a>Bonus Phrase: With All Due Respect</h2>
<p>The funny part about saying this is that you don't respect that person. You're frustrated with them.</p>
<p>You want to speak your mind &#8211; but you don't want to be held accountable for it.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Saying &#8220;with all due respect&#8221; does not absolve you from the consequences of your words.</em></strong></h4>
<p>We all know what it means. You don't see eye to eye with this person, and you don’t respect them.</p>
<p>So, how do you deal with this? Don’t start it with that. That's going to make the other person defensive.</p>
<p>Again, pull them into a private conversation. Many studies have shown that whenever people are behind closed doors, with no worries about having to look good in front of others, they're more open to seeing another person's point of view.</p>
<p>Also &#8211; don't try to press it on them. You can't force someone to see your point of view, but <a href="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/change-peoples-minds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">you can help them realize the truth</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="12"></a>Bonus Phrase: Let’s Nip This In The Butt</h2>
<p>Ouch! That's not what you meant to say. You want to say, &#8220;nip this in the bud.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-94447 size-full" src="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrases-nip-in-bud.jpg" alt="phrase nip in bud" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrases-nip-in-bud.jpg 700w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrases-nip-in-bud-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrases-nip-in-bud-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/phrases-nip-in-bud-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Nip this in the bud&#8221; refers to cutting something off before it has the chance to grow. It refers to plants. In other words &#8211; a little bit of work early on can save you a lot of hassle later.</p>
