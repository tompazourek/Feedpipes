<p>Inheritance and composition are two programming techniques developers use to establish relationships between classes and objects. Whereas inheritance derives one class from another, composition defines a class as the sum of its parts.</p><p>Classes and objects created through inheritance are <em>tightly coupled</em> because changing the parent or superclass in an inheritance relationship risks breaking your code. Classes and objects created through composition are <em>loosely coupled</em>, meaning that you can more easily change the component parts without breaking your code.</p><p>Because loosely coupled code offers more flexibility, many developers have learned that composition is a better technique than inheritance, but the truth is more complex. Choosing a programming tool is similar to choosing the correct kitchen tool: You wouldn't use a butter knife to cut vegetables, and in the same way you shouldn't choose composition for every programming scenario. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/3409071/java-challenger-7-debugging-java-inheritance.html#jump">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p class="toc">Everyone is learning to write software these days. That means every school, MOOC, and training site needs to embrace a first language for the young Padawans. Some places, like fusty Harvard, still cling to the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3402023/why-the-c-programming-language-still-rules.html">70’s era C</a>, but many schools are oscillating between JavaScript, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204016/what-is-python.html">Python</a>, and Java. One is buried in every browser, one is the clean choice of the social sciences, and one is the type-rich preference of more mathematically-minded folks.</p><p>Is one the best choice? Is one clearly better than the others? Or are they all equally likely to send a substantial number of students screaming into their pillows at night?

<p><em>Polymorphism</em> refers to the ability of some entities to occur in different forms. It is popularly represented by the butterfly, which morphs from larva to pupa to imago. Polymorphism also exists in programming languages, as a modeling technique that allows you to create a single interface to various operands, arguments, and objects. Java polymorphism results in code that is more concise and easier to maintain.</p><p>While this tutorial focuses on subtype polymorphism, there are several other types you should know about. We'll start with an overview of all four types of polymorphism.</p><aside class="sidebar">
