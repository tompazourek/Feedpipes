      <title>On the Beat with Harper Lee</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/BlYqQty3s2g/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lee_harper-081519.jpg" /&gt;How do you write the history of a book that was never written, by an author who, if not exactly a recluse, was more determined than most not to publicize her life or writing process? And how do you make that mystery worth reading when its conclusion is widely known? These questions loom in Casey Cep’s remarkable, thoroughly researched &lt;i&gt;Furious Hours&lt;/i&gt;, an account of the true-crime book that Harper Lee intended to write but ultimately abandoned more than two decades after the publication of &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/i&gt; had made her a household name.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/BlYqQty3s2g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>My Travels with Oliver Sacks</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/V9-qhoo2m0k/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handler-sacks.jpg" /&gt;We were close for a long time. I was his photographer, colleague, friend, subject, and occasional collaborator. He used to say that he wanted to take off his white doctor’s coat and see Tourette’s in real life, outside a clinic or hospital. I facilitated this not only as a photographer, but also as someone with access to others with the same condition. In my travels with Oliver, I photographed the lives of patients, beyond the confines of the doctor’s office or examination room. Some said I was his “Tourette pet,” which I found endearing or insulting, depending on how it was said.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/V9-qhoo2m0k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dying Art of Instruction in the Digital Classroom</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/d45SCGYX554/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/parks-teaching.jpg" /&gt;This year will be my last year teaching at the university; I’ve decided to throw in the towel three years before retirement age. There are a number of reasons behind this decision, but one is definitely the changed situation in the classroom. Even at post-graduate level, it is getting more and more difficult to feel that one has the attention of students or that something really useful is happening during the lessons.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/d45SCGYX554" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>An Iranian Dissident’s Tale</title>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/190725_Kian_Tajbakhsh_Portraits_014.jpg" /&gt;Kian Tajbakhsh wanted to own his punishment—to see himself as part of a struggle, alongside millions of other Iranians, that may have been fruitless but had been worth fighting for. His interrogators had been coaching him for his appearance at the trial, but when he took the stand, Kian diverted from the script in a small but crucial way. He told the judge his real crime had not been treason, but the naivety to believe that the Islamic Republic could ever be compatible with Western-style democracy.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/ydWRe5rKVH8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Real Americans</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/oFDfU1__8hw/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/oneill_1-081519.jpg" /&gt;The cornerstone assertion of the Declaration of Independence is that government exists in order to secure the equal, inalienable rights of persons. This is the formal raison d’être and official ideology of the United States. It follows that those who fully embrace those rights—liberals—have political and patriotic legitimacy, and those who reject them lack legitimacy. Psychically, liberals often don’t seem to believe this. A deference to “Americans” inheres in their worldview, even if the Americans in question aspire to subvert our democracy.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/oFDfU1__8hw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Absent Opposition, Modi Makes India His Hindu Nation</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/4DAOCbyTw4U/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PAR460411.jpg" /&gt;The rot may have set in decades ago, but it has taken Modi only five years to dismantle the idea of India as democratic and secular. The opposition movement is fragmentary and local. India under Modi was no longer the world’s fastest-growing economy. And whatever upward mobility was anticipated thanks to social welfare programs implemented by earlier governments could no longer be taken for granted. The prime minister’s opponents fought for a more equal society, but Modi himself, like strongmen elsewhere in the world, could only prosper in an unequal and divided one. And yet, Modi won again: a divisive and ineffectual prime minister returned to power with a historic mandate.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/4DAOCbyTw4U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>The V&amp;A Makes a Meal of It</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/5NpVZyoudLw/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/download.jpg" /&gt;The V&amp;#038;A could usefully have taken a leaf out of its own history. In the catalog foreword by the museum’s director, the historian and former Labour Party parliamentarian Tristram Hunt, we learn that the V&amp;#038;A boasted the world’s first “purpose-built museum refreshment rooms,” designed by William Morris’s firm. The V&amp;#038;A also included, Hunt goes on, “an early food museum, alongside displays of working fish hatcheries—installed by the eccentric, visionary zoologist Frank Buckland.” To be sure, the Comté cheese made using microbes taken from chef Heston Blumenthal’s pubic hair is as playful as it is subversive, but the theme of this scatter-shot show remains elusive: Is it about food really, or is it a show of food-related conceptual art?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/5NpVZyoudLw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Paula Rego’s Wild Women</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/UaSQNRhyxQ4/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rego-abortion-untitled.jpg" /&gt;As in so much of her work, the phantasmagoric takes on something of the real, a nightmare brought to life, or the turmoil of a psyche revealed. Paula Rego’s well aware that women’s bodies are sites of trauma. She recounts her own birth, for example, as a horror story: her mother labored for three days, at the end of which she, the baby—“this carcass,” as Rego pointedly describes herself—was “dragged” out, ripping her mother’s bladder in the process. Rego’s work is dense with symbolism, but all in service of portraying the realities—as unpalatable and grotesque as they sometimes are—of the female body.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/UaSQNRhyxQ4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Between Hospitality and Hostility’: An Interview with Michael Rakowitz</title>

&lt;em&gt;Michael Rakowitz&lt;/em&gt;: I decided there was no way that I was going to allow for this &lt;em&gt;Lamassu&lt;/em&gt; to look like it is one more piece that is going to be sheltered in this Western museum. I’m very happy to say that the &lt;em&gt;Lamassu&lt;/em&gt; stands there with its ass to the museum and it’s actually looking southeast toward Parliament, and toward the Foreign Office where the decision to enter the Iraq War was made. It’s also looking past them, toward Nineveh, toward Iraq, hoping that it will return one day.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/U8RlGRFBePs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gleick_3-081519.jpg" /&gt;First it was a heavenly body—a beacon, or a world, a place where no one could possibly go. Then, from 1969 to 1972, twelve people landed there in spaceships. On behalf of all humanity, they said. Is it time to go back? Moon fever is rising. The fiftieth anniversary of the first lunar landing has stirred dormant memories and produced a bounty of books, films, and exhibitions. Meanwhile, technocrat billionaires have helped catalyze a new moon race. Elon Musk is marketing moon trips to the superrich, and Jeff Bezos says we should colonize the moon to save the earth. China landed a robot called Jade Rabbit 2 on the far side in January, and India is trying to get a water-seeking rover, Chandrayaan-2, to the lunar south pole.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/_bESDx-x3Vg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="" /&gt;&lt;i&gt;To the Editors&lt;/i&gt;: In my “The Rules of the Game” I wrote that the 15 percent of Democrats who identified as conservative “were probably mostly older, white union men who vote Republican for president as often as not, and a smattering of older Latino men as well.” But according to Kathleen Frankovic, what mostly sets them apart is that they are more religious than other Democrats.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/McTDvXDwoys" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Lincoln The Hack?</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/mDy5vXD3wTc/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="" /&gt;&lt;i&gt;To the Editors&lt;/i&gt;: James Oakes writes, “It is a commonplace among historians that...in his early career [Lincoln] was something of a Whig Party hack.” I find this statement amazing. How in the world do those words apply to the brave, eloquent, and politically costly words and actions undertaken by the first-term congressman Lincoln in opposition to James K. Polk’s mendaciously undertaken war of conquest against Mexico?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/mDy5vXD3wTc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Worlds Apart: Sci-Fi Visions of Altered Reality</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/WktIjJa7dxA/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sun-ra.jpg" /&gt;Living in an era when we can easily tweak the small (delete a sentence, crop an image) but feel helpless when facing the large (political turmoil, climate change), it’s hard not to fantasize about reworking our histories. But this inclination is not new. Attempting to rework the past, at least on paper, has been the outlet of artists and authors for as long as people have been wishing for different endings. “As If: Alternative Histories From Then to Now,” an exhibition at the Drawing Center, presents eighty-four works from 1888 to the present that “offer examples of how we might reimagine historical narratives in order to contend with the traumas of contemporary life.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/WktIjJa7dxA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>‘A Compelling Power’: When Mesmerism Came to America</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/2BeZ5n0EFgA/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mesmer-detail.jpg" /&gt;Between 1836 and the late 1850s, mesmerizing another person—or seeing someone get mesmerized, or denouncing mesmerists as charlatans—became a way of stockpiling control for one’s own use. The direct encounters between clairvoyants and the men who mesmerized them seem less like collaborations than like competitions over who would set the terms of the session and whose interests it would serve. The subjects’ flashes of insight have a sharp-edged, glinting tone. They become ambushes against the mesmerist’s authority, ways of struggling for dependencies that gave the somnambulist’s mind more room to move.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/2BeZ5n0EFgA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Fiddler,’ Tevye’s Daughters, and Me</title>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-50465887.jpg" /&gt;For me, the story of &lt;em&gt;Fiddler on the Roof&lt;/em&gt; and Tevye’s casting out of Chava is personal. In June 1963, when I married a nominally Episcopalian professor of French, my parents disowned me, and so did my grandparents, all but two of my twenty-plus aunts and uncles, and all but three of my dozens of cousins. No one from my family came to our wedding, and I did not see them again for fifteen years. I sometimes wonder if I should write a sequel called &lt;em&gt;Chava Returns&lt;/em&gt;. In my directorial mind, just one woman appears, and she’s no longer a girl. It’s Chava, but she’s not alone. She’s with her husband and she’s happy.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/0c0P5uyjTrg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Between Regime and Rebels: A Survey of Syria’s Alawi Sect</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/7TqJ8D7jKZs/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-482735183.jpg" /&gt;The Assad regime’s heavy reliance on Alawis in the army units and militias dispatched to the front-lines, coupled with the community’s relatively small size, have resulted in disproportionate losses of the sect’s young men. In addition, corruption and war-profiteering, mainly benefitting high-ranking regime officers and mukhabarat (secret police) agents, reinforced the image of Alawis as corrupt, privileged and rich, in the eyes of Sunnis. The Alawis are fully aware of this image and are quick to reject it. “We are a community that sacrificed many of its youth, and lived, and is still living, in poverty,” said Samira, a twenty-five-year-old university student. “The ugly, barbaric way people picture us is applicable to barely one percent of us.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/7TqJ8D7jKZs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Dancing with the Ancients</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/Mwp6tQth3k8/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hymn-apollo4.jpg" /&gt;By its nature, dance poses unique challenges for scholars. There’s no universal notation system, and the various ways we have to document it are incomplete and unreliable. There is no full way to capture the presence of dance except through dance itself. This tension—between dance and the representation of dance—is always at the heart of dance; dancers feel it, too, and so do the people who watch dance and the people who write about it. The recent exhibition “Hymn to Apollo: The Ancient World and the Ballets Russes” at NYU’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World reminded me how intriguing this tension is.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/Mwp6tQth3k8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Singapore: Laboratory of Digital Censorship</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/DS3NQ5XbHfQ/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-847821370.jpg" /&gt;On May 8, Singapore’s parliament passed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), with an audacious aim— to defeat “fake news.” The new law empowers any minister to demand corrections from anyone who has generated content that the minister believes is fake and to dictate the words and phrases of that correction; the government can also ask for the content to be taken down, and require Internet service providers or platforms to prevent access to it. The implications of Singapore’s law, however, go far beyond a family row and even the governance of Singapore itself. Around the world there are plenty of governments that would love to wield such powers. They will be watching how Singapore uses its new law—with keen interest and considerable envy.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/DS3NQ5XbHfQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/otoole_1-081519.jpg" /&gt;Does Boris Johnson believe any of his own claims, and do his followers in turn believe him? In both cases, the answer is yes, but only in the highly qualified way that an actor inhabits his role and an audience knowingly accepts the pretense. Johnson’s appeal lies precisely in the creation of a comic persona that evades the distinction between reality and performance.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/kyP8fuWn0Vw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Iran: The Case Against War</title>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/simon_1-081519.jpg" /&gt;The similarities between the current situation and the prelude to the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2002–2003 are unmistakable. A pugnacious and insecure US president obsessed with a government he has demonized is unconstrained due to a disrupted interagency process and a Congress paralyzed by a cowed and craven Republican Party. Sycophantic advisers and inordinately influential foreign powers insist that he can remake a region purportedly forsaken by his despised liberal predecessor. It is probably lost on Bolton and Pompeo—and certainly on Trump—that the US intervention in Iraq ended up increasing Iranian influence there and elsewhere in the region. It may also be lost on them that a war with Iran could be even more disastrous than the war in Iraq.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/iNsW7m6uKko" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>National Conservatism: Retrofitting Trump’s GOP with a Veneer of Ideas</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/qqrNRHb5irI/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1139127451.jpg" /&gt;The Burke Institute’s conference on “National Conservatism” was a Trump-inspired counter-revolution, a conservative colloquy that aimed at creating a catechism purged of the verities of the Reagan era: a crusading foreign policy and an idolatry of free-market economics. Usually, intellectual movements precede the rise of political ones, but in this case, Trump’s camp followers are reverse-engineering an intellectual doctrine to match Trump’s basic instincts. The new national-conservatives want to form what Burke called “little platoons” to ground conservatism based on what they see as an Anglo-Saxon heritage.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/qqrNRHb5irI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>The New Fugitive Slave Laws</title>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1148880999.jpg" /&gt;There are still individuals who, regardless of race and ethnicity, do not accept or support their government’s unjust and inhumane policies. If the history of slavery and the fight against it has taught us something, it is that racial proscriptions and divisions suit those who seek to dehumanize and exploit people they construe as the other. For this reason, the interracial nineteenth-century abolition movement can provide valuable inspiration to those involved in today’s efforts to provide humanitarian aid to migrants and refugees and to resist the threatened descent into authoritarianism, mass atrocity, and inhumanity.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/mJmLw9f_4BI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>A Historic Win for New York Tenants</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/I8ivKAGwSpA/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AP_19156066293086.jpg" /&gt;On June 14, the State Legislature in Albany passed a bill that will profoundly change the tenor of life in New York City. The law—known officially as the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, but dubbed by its advocates “universal rent control”—strengthens tenant protections for the city’s nearly one million privately owned, rent-stabilized apartments. The release from distress for thousands of people facing the prospect of displacement will ripple through the city. With the passage of this bill, the lament that has become a cliché—that New York has lost its soul, that it offers no space for the unconventional, that it is home only to the rich and ruthless—will be significantly less true.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/I8ivKAGwSpA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/0-murdoch-gelgud-B.jpg" /&gt;It started about ten years ago when I was walking around in the west village with my girlfriend Jolie. In the Housing Works on West 10th I saw a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Good Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;. I'd never heard of Iris Murdoch before but I liked the description on the back. I started reading it that night, and was hooked. It's about search for meaning, has a big cast, it's mysterious, and has a hint of weird magic. As I read more of her books, I'd see that that could describe almost all of them. So, what happens in an Iris Murdoch novel?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/WnVhMeood0g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Which Way to the City on a Hill?</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/_NJN71Bv1MI/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/venne-poverty.jpg" /&gt;Recently, at a lunch with a group of graduate students, conversation turned to American colonial history, then to John Winthrop’s 1630 speech “A Modell of Christian Charity,” associated now with an image borrowed from Jesus, “a city on a hill.” This phrase has been grossly misinterpreted, both Winthrop’s use of it and Jesus’. In any case, the students pronounced the speech capitalist, with a certainty and unanimity that, quite frankly, is inappropriate to any historical subject, and would be, even if the students, or the teachers who gave them the word, could define “capitalist.” Because I encounter variants of this conversation in such settings all over the country, I should not be heard as criticizing any particular university when I say that such certainty is not the product of good education. Indeed, it is distinctively the product of bad education.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/_NJN71Bv1MI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>A Radical Realist View of Tibetan Buddhism at the Rubin</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/9uSGpqvgV3Q/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rubin-shambhala.jpg" /&gt;For many people in the West, Buddhism is completely divorced from its history. So many of the beliefs and rites have been stripped away that many Westerners regard it purely as a philosophy, rather than a religion. As well-intentioned as this version of Buddhism might be, it is also a fantasy that places its practice on a higher moral and spiritual plane and erects an unbridgeable distance between us and its real, historical significance in Tibet. This exhibition offers an unsentimental, non-Orientalist perspective on Tibet, in which violence is a normal part of the political and religious discourse, as elsewhere in the world.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/9uSGpqvgV3Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>The Incendiary Sexual Politics of ‘Burn This’</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/A8emWx4m44g/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/driver-burn-this.jpg" /&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Burn This&lt;/em&gt;, currently in revival at the Hudson Theatre, male force is the prelude, perhaps even the key, to female seduction. Here’s how I explain it: to be socialized as female is to be told that a man knows your desire better than you do. If what a man wants to do is force you to kiss him, who are you to say you don’t want to be kissed? If what a man wants to do is hurt you, who are you to say you don’t want to be hurt? I do not mean to deny female agency; I mean to contextualize it. Can a woman willingly submit to a man? Yes, and in any number of ways. But she inevitably does so under the umbrella of patriarchy, her desires not defined, but in some way colored, by its shadow.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/A8emWx4m44g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

They followed the waiters obediently. Suddenly, a whisper ran through the dining hall: “&lt;em&gt;Chernobylskye&lt;/em&gt;.” People from Chernobyl. In a moment, we got new neighbors: a woman in her early thirties and a girl of five. By the meal’s end, we’d learned that Varya and Katya were from Gomel, a Belarus city about seventy miles north of Chernobyl. At the beginning of June, the plant where Varya worked had started distributing free vouchers to Black Sea resorts. The sea air was healthful and healing, the plant’s management had told them, though nobody would say what they might need healing from.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/KSWfT_V99sY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mali1.jpg" /&gt;I first met Fanta in the fens of the flooded Inner Niger Delta. I walked with her, taking the annular route her ancestors had established during the nineteenth-century Macina Empire, or possibly earlier. Last year, after the attacks in Koumaga and Somena, Fanta’s family abandoned their usual route and drove their cattle toward sunset. Now they are among the more than a quarter of a million Malians displaced by conflict. Their most recent camp is about a hundred miles away from their historic pastures, in a part of Mali where they had never walked before.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/AqDuGPOS7jk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1144708934.jpg" /&gt;Along with Marine le Pen in France, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, Italy’s Matteo Salvini is leading a startling resurgence of Europe’s far right. Across the continent, the messaging of these right-wing populists is increasingly slick, their party machines are disciplined, and their policies have been carefully crafted to appeal to a wider range of voters. Part of the explanation for this surge, however, became clearer for us when we started tracking the international financial flows linked to many of America’s most powerful Christian conservative groups. Several of the American activists who twenty years ago signed the Manhattan Declaration, the religious right’s manifesto dedicated to promoting “life, family, and freedom,” have since made numerous trips across the Atlantic, along with a great deal of cash to support their efforts.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/qvI8_uD2WNQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>The Murderer, the Writer, the Reckoning</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/enAujrhjkv8/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/h_14935102.jpg" /&gt;On February 10, 2002, in a New York State prison cell, the bestselling author and twice-convicted killer Jack Abbott hanged himself. That same day, the body of the man I murdered washed ashore on a Brooklyn beach. My reason for connecting these two events is to try to account for my crime, to understand better why I did it, and to describe what Abbott’s legacy, as a prison writer of an earlier generation, has meant for me as a prison writer in this generation. Although he and I never met, I can almost picture us in adjacent cells in Clinton, holding hand-mirrors through the bars of our cell doors so that we could see each other to talk. In my imagination, I’d suggest to Abbott that what he was writing wasn’t the right story—it showed no remorse. Most likely, he would have rejected my advice, and we’d have never spoken again. It’s like that in prison.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/enAujrhjkv8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-628239484.jpg" /&gt;As veteran members of the reformist movement in Iran, we are concerned about the mortal blow that even a limited military conflict with the United States of America will deal to the democratic movement of Iran. We can already feel the restrictions that the crisis of the last two years has imposed on the fragile civil society and peaceful political activity in Iran. There are people on both sides of the political and ideological divide between Iran and the US who are convinced that they will benefit from the business of war with Iran. They are wrong. This war will have only losers. The vicious counsel of warmongers must give way to the calm voices of peace and reconciliation.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/BAFH7EAEAIs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>A Ferocious Heat in Delhi</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/wGZFnHvuXVQ/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delhi-heat.jpg" /&gt;This spring in Delhi, the temperature reached 113 degrees Fahrenheit, the first time in almost fifty years that the city had seen that kind of heat; on June 9, the government issued a red alert, as the mercury reached 118 degrees. At that temperature, your eyes feel sandblasted, your skin feels on fire, the water is hot from the tap, and the leaves on the neem and amaltas trees wither and shrivel. The worst-affected of the city’s 1.98 million population are those in jobs far from the luxuries of air-conditioning or ceiling fans—construction workers, clerks who cycle for miles to their offices, delivery boys, the women who run pavement stalls. At least 100 deaths across the country have been attributed to the heat, and city hospitals have seen a spike in emergency room visits, mostly for heat stroke, severe dehydration, and lung problems—with parts of the country potentially becoming too hot to be inhabitable.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/wGZFnHvuXVQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>A Universe of One’s Own</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/0VXWOeBM-Rw/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rudick_1-071819.jpg" /&gt;“Write me a creature who thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man.” This was the challenge the influential science-fiction editor John Campbell famously issued his authors in the 1940s. It was aimed at producing aliens as fully formed as the interstellar human travelers who encounter them. Isaac Asimov thought the best example was a creature named Tweel from Stanley Weinbaum’s “A Martian Odyssey,” a story from 1934 that preceded the dictum. But the instruction also has the feel of a riddle, and neither Campbell nor Asimov considered its most obvious answer: a woman.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/0VXWOeBM-Rw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>A Long &amp; Undeclared Emergency</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/Cj3VW2yaPPk/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mishra_1-071819.jpg" /&gt;India for the last five years has been in a state of internal siege. The radicalization of its public sphere has barely been noticed in the West. Indeed, Barack Obama, writing about Modi in 2015 for &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;’s list of the world’s hundred most influential people, claimed that he “reflects the dynamism and potential of India’s rise” and that he is “determined to help more Indians follow in his path.” Many of the Indians who follow in Modi’s path have seemed more like a lynch mob, hunting in both real and virtual worlds for various enemies of the people. The scapegoats for Modi’s economic failures can include Muslims suspected of eating or storing beef, writers and journalists critical of the regime, and anyone deemed insufficiently patriotic.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/Cj3VW2yaPPk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Dora Maar’s Piercing Gaze</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/UOK5EDp4GMM/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maar1.jpg" /&gt;This haunting show, in the cool gallery spaces high above the city that Dora Maar knew so well, makes it clear that she was indeed a star, a leading figure in Surrealist photo-montage of the mid-1930s. Maar’s largest exhibition in France, it contains over 400 of her works, yet, like the model in the banner, she turns away, and hides her face, remaining enigmatic in her work. In &lt;em&gt;Self-Portrait with Fan&lt;/em&gt; (1930), she shows only her reflection in a mirror, her serious gaze shrouded by the circles of an electric fan. She looks as if she might blow away, dissolve into fragments.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/UOK5EDp4GMM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Carrying a Single Life: On Literature and Translation</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/eF7kpyKuOEc/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anchises-aeneas-vase.jpg" /&gt;Can we draw a link between the intricate and often modest work of writers and translators, and the bold and costly actions of activists? Is the work of literature connected to the risks some people undertake to save others? I believe so—because acts of language can themselves be acts of courage, just as both literature and activism alert us to the arbitrary and essentially conventional nature of borders. How can literature help us?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/eF7kpyKuOEc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-79668380.jpg" /&gt;In a departure from traditional Independence Day celebrations on July 4 in Washington, D.C., Donald Trump decreed that this year’s event, which he has called a “Salute to America,” would involve a military parade featuring US Army tanks and Air Force flyovers, as well as a presidential address before a ticketed VIP audience at the Lincoln Memorial. To mark the occasion, the editors prepared a visual history of military parades.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/hzcdME0Mc9E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

      <title>Triumph and Disaster: The Tragic Hubris of Rudyard Kipling’s ‘If—’</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/nybooks/~3/ivdfgDmn4uE/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src="https://www.nybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1201841.jpg" /&gt;For these next two weeks, the best tennis players in the world will enter Wimbledon’s fabled Center Court under two lines of poetry inscribed in capital letters above the tunnel that leads from the locker room: “IF YOU CAN MEET WITH TRIUMPH AND DISASTER / AND TREAT THOSE TWO IMPOSTORS JUST THE SAME…” The passage is from Rudyard Kipling’s “If—,” once voted Britain’s most popular poem. It might surprise the poem’s many enthusiasts to learn that Kipling, who lived for several years in Vermont and built himself a tennis court there (reputedly the first in the state), originally used “If—” as the epilogue to a story about George Washington and his resistance to public opinion. Today, it is Kipling himself who often faces the public’s wrath.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nybooks/~4/ivdfgDmn4uE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
