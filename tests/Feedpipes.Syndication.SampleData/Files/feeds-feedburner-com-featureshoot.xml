<p><a href="http://www.tamibahatphotography.com">Tami Bahat</a>’s photographic portraiture is at once unique and familiar: unique in its distinct approach to lighting and Victorian-era style, yet familiar in its visual cues, referencing the work of old masters such as Vermeer and Rembrandt.</p>
<p>The work in Bahat’s series, <em>Dramatis Personae</em>, is tied to the tradition of painting. In her piece <em>The Painter</em>, a seemingly conventional composition becomes quite complex upon further investigation, as a baboon takes center stage in a once traditional artist portrait. There is a subtle twist in each of Bahat’s photographs, quietly demanding the attention of the viewer. <span id="more-137409"></span></p>
<p>Originally from Tel Aviv, Israel, Bahat currently lives and works in Los Angeles. Recently, her work has been exhibited at Lisa Sette Gallery, Phoenix, Van Rensburg Gallery, NYC, Diane Tanzer + Nicola Stein Gallery, Australia, and <a href="https://www.edelmangallery.com/">Catherine Edelman Gallery</a>, Chicago, which is hosting her solo exhibition <a href="http://www.edelmangallery.com/exhibitions-and-projects/exhibition-pages/2019/tami-bahat-past-is-present.html"><em>Past is Present</em></a>.</p>
<p>In the exhibition, the vintage objects and props present within each photograph come out of the frame and into the gallery, creating a different kind of experience for the audience than is expected. The gallery space has been transformed into Victorian-era rooms, complete with DIY vintage wallpaper. It’s these small details that prompt Bahat’s photographs, and the exhibition as a whole, to come to life.</p>
<p>Here, Tami Bahat discusses the immersive elements of <em>Past is Present</em>, her process working with her models and animals, and how she achieves her painterly effect.</p>
<div id="attachment_137422" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137422" class="size-full wp-image-137422" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bahat_2019_05-e1564234305712.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /><p id="caption-attachment-137422" class="wp-caption-text">© Tami Bahat / courtesy Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago</p></div>
<p><strong>Did you always know you wanted to be a photographer? Do you have any formal training in the field? </strong><br />
&#8220;I don’t have a formal education in photography. However, my father was an art teacher. He would point out the nuances of lighting, expressions, shades, and shadows. He shared his love of art and the Old Masters with me, and that was something we certainly bonded over. I was very fortunate to learn from and be inspired by him on a daily basis. I knew from a very young age that I loved photography and portraiture. My love and affinity for the art form continued growing over time and I knew it was something I wanted to explore further.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a bit about your series <em>Dramatis Personae</em>. </strong><br />
&#8220;I began creating this work in 2015. The majority of the models are family and friends who have little to no experience in front of the camera, which I love. I enjoy going into each shoot with concepts prepared but no set expectations. I always leave the door open for a bit of mystery and whatever they would like to explore and contribute. Many of the photographs also include live animals so I like to watch the relationship unfold from the moment the models meet them. The world created is all very beautiful and intriguing to me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The dramatic, chiaroscuro lighting in this series gives each photo an aesthetic like that of a painting. How do you achieve this effect?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I shift the light depending on the scene and diffuse it accordingly. It’s all about creating a very specific mood and atmosphere and paying attention to the smallest of details. I’m extremely particular and work hard to stay present and adjust to whatever is happening in the moment.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137419" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137419" class="wp-image-137419 size-full" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tami-bts-32-e1564234041781.jpeg" alt="" width="620" height="414" /><p id="caption-attachment-137419" class="wp-caption-text"><em>© Tami Bahat</em></p></div>
<p><strong>In your current solo exhibition <em>Past is Present</em>at the Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago, props used in the making of your photographs are physically installed in the gallery. What inspired you to bring these elements into the exhibition? How do you think this changes the viewer’s experience when viewing your work?</strong><br />
&#8220;The idea is to create a unique experience for the viewer that invites them into this world. They can walk through someone’s bedroom and feel like a visitor in another time and place. It’s almost as if you could stand there patiently enough, the portraits and surroundings would start to whisper a story or two to you. I think they’re a great supportive element to the work.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137425" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137425" class="wp-image-137425 size-full" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-27-08.51.28-e1564235004172.png" alt="" width="620" height="412" /><p id="caption-attachment-137425" class="wp-caption-text">© Tami Bahat / courtesy Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago</p></div>
<p><strong>The feel of the exhibition <em>Past is Present </em>is very moody, reminiscent of painting from the Dutch Renaissance. The installations have truly created an atmosphere that transports you to a different time. What goes into the process of planning an exhibition that is as immersive as this, especially when you live in California and the exhibition is in Chicago?</strong><br />
&#8220;I have to express my gratitude to the staff of the Catherine Edelman Gallery. It was an honor to have these hard-working individuals completely invest their time and energy in my vision as an artist. It’s rare to be taken in with such a level of support from people who are as equally ambitious and want to create something distinct.</p>
<p>&#8220;In California, we built a model of the gallery to wrap our heads around how we would lay everything out in Chicago. I’ve always been able to walk through a space beforehand so this was very different for me. There were many discussions as to where each piece would be placed. We shipped out a truckload of furniture and once we arrived in Chicago the real work began with painting, stenciling, staging, hanging the work and gently placing quail eggs in a bird’s nest atop the mantle of the sitting room.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137412" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137412" class="wp-image-137412 size-full" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Banner-e1564233974375.jpeg" alt="© Tami Bahat / courtesy Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago" width="620" height="465" /><p id="caption-attachment-137412" class="wp-caption-text">© Tami Bahat / courtesy Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago</p></div>
<p><strong>Vintage frames as well as Victorian-style furniture and décor appear repeatedly in your photos and really shape the work that you do. What is it about this era that appeals to you, aesthetically or otherwise?</strong><br />
&#8220;I sense that I existed in these other times and connect to them so strongly. The frames and furniture have been there, too, so we just kind of reminisce like old friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Where or how do you find the objects and/or props that you use in <em>Dramatis Personae</em>?</strong><br />
&#8220;I search extensively both locally and internationally. Anywhere from auction houses to estate sales to flea markets.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137423" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137423" class="size-full wp-image-137423" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-27-08.45.27-e1564234519686.png" alt="" width="620" height="412" /><p id="caption-attachment-137423" class="wp-caption-text"><em>© Tami Bahat / courtesy Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago</em></p></div>
<p><strong>When did you start incorporating animals in your photography? Where do you get these animals from?</strong><br />
&#8220;I started off with reptiles like snakes to Madagascar hissing cockroaches. From there, I jumped into more exotic animals. I’ve worked with great rescue organizations and phenomenal animal handlers. I love seeing these beautiful creatures treated with love and respect, especially those that have had a rougher go of things early on.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>If you could photograph any animal, what would it be and why?</strong><br />
&#8220;A giraffe and elephant. They’re simply magnificent!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What draws you to portraiture? Do you personally know the subjects in your work? </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I remember being drawn to portraiture, even as a young child. I received a journal from my parents for one of my birthdays with a painting of a little girl on the cover and I was absolutely in love with it. Later as a teenager, when hiking with friends, I would document the people around me in the scene as opposed to all the nature around us. I’m drawn to understanding the human experience. Most of the people in <em>Dramatis Personae</em>are family and friends who have never modeled before and I want their first experience in the art form to be positive. To explore and create something that’s never existed before is exciting.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137421" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137421" class="wp-image-137421 size-full" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Writer-e1564234165300.jpg" alt="The Writer, 2015 © Tami Bahat / courtesy Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago" width="620" height="622" /><p id="caption-attachment-137421" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Writer, 2015 © Tami Bahat / courtesy Catherine Edelman Gallery, Chicago</em></p></div>
<p><strong>Often works with the simplest compositions are the most difficult to capture. Which photograph in your series <em>Dramatis Personae </em>proved to be the biggest challenge and why?</strong><br />
&#8220;I underestimated the speed of the armadillo in, <em>Frank the Tank</em>. The combination of how fast that little guy was while shooting in low light was challenging, but we still managed to get the shot, thank goodness!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Who are your biggest artistic influences? Are there any photographers working right now whose work you find particularly interesting?</strong><br />
&#8220;Some amazing artists that come to mind that move me are Caravaggio, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Rodin, Marc Chagall, Yosl Bergner, Valérie Goutard, Sophie Favre and Antony Gormley. As far as photographers go, I really enjoy the works of Sally Mann, Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Joel-Peter Witkin, and Nadav Kander just to name a few. I also love jazz and cinematography and documentaries so my inspiration list could just go on and on…&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody knows his real name or has ever seen a photograph of him. Yet, the guy has about 60,000 followers on Instagram and is constantly tagged by today’s greatest celebrities. He’s even got <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vemix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his own entry</a> in the Urban Dictionary, where his name is defined as a verb.<span id="more-137289"></span></p>
<p>In a time when trolling is the internet’s basic skill, Vemix has elevated it into an artform. His photo manipulations are so realistic, many news outlets have presented his creations as real, and sometimes the very people in the photos think they’re authentic.</p>

<p>Last April, British tabloid The Mirror <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/tupac-shakur-alive-hiding-tattoos-14235934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article</a> that claimed Tupak Shakur was still alive, and used one of Vemix’s creations as &#8216;proof&#8217; of the popular conspiracy theory that says the influential rapper now lives in Mexico.</p>
<p>Just last week, Snoop Dogg posted on his Instagram a Vemix of him as a young man smoking weed alongside none other than Kurt Cobain. “Young dogg with Kurt,” he captioned the image, we don’t know if in jest, or honestly believing the photograph was real.</p>
<p>Vemix’s photo manipulations have caused so much confusion, Snopes, one of the most popular fact-checkers on the internet, has dedicated <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/steve-irwin-tupac-friendship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a couple</a> of <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/donald-trump-tupac-photo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entries</a> exposing his photographs.</p>
<p>We stood at the crossroads and midnight, and in exchange for our soul we were granted the opportunity to interview the enigmatic Photoshop artist. A hero or a villain, you decide.</p>

<p><strong>What were you doing with your life before becoming the mighty VEMIX? How have your days changed since that photo of 2Pac exploded?</strong><br />
&#8220;I was legit doing the exact same thing. Just your regular Dad Dude. Work, raise, repeat. I have always spent my free time doing something creative, in whatever medium I&#8217;m into at that moment. I used to build a lot of stuff and play guitar. But now there are so many fun opportunities doing this, I don&#8217;t do much else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, everything you see coming from my direction is created between 9am-2pm Monday mornings, while my kids are at school. That&#8217;s how I roll. Call the crib, same number, same hood, it&#8217;s all good.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Can you walk us through your retouching process? What’s your usual workflow when you’re approaching a new photo manipulation?</strong><br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s a tricky one to capture. They usually just kinda already happen in my head before I make them. People generally set out to make one and that&#8217;s where they go wrong. If you have to force it, it&#8217;s going to look forced.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have two pictures that line up perfectly, with the right angles and picture quality, but if the light source is wrong, it&#8217;s just going to look weird. I&#8217;ll just be driving or going about my day then a song or conversation will have me thinking about stuff, which leads to a couple pictures kicking around on the back burner, then I dump them in my email to chop them up when I get a chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you have the right specimens, it&#8217;s just a matter of meeting at the lowest quality of the two pictures and a sprinkle of my secret ingredient. Which is not Brown sugar. Chances are if someone says they got a secret ingredient, that shit’s just Brown sugar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I try and avoid black and white if I can, it’s just a telltale sign of a Photoshop. But sometimes one of the pics is black and white so you just have to. Alright, I&#8217;ve said too much LOL.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What’s the most difficult VEMIX you’ve done so far, and which one was the easiest?</strong><br />
&#8220;The most difficult one would have to be &#8216;Thermite&#8217;, the one with all the rappers in the studio that Dre shared. It took a lot longer than I have the patience for. You can tell from Jay-Z&#8217;s mug.</p>
<p>&#8220;By that time I was done and I just plopped his obviously photoshopped head on a random body, clicked it to black and white because I didn&#8217;t feel like spending a week on blending 20 different skin tones and posted it. All the rest were easy.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Any Youtube channels or books that you can recommend for anyone wanting to get deep into photo editing?</strong><br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know much about photo editing besides what I taught myself. I never even followed any other photo editors until recently, for fear of subconsciously biting them. Just keep fucking with whatever you&#8217;re doing and do it your way. That&#8217;s how ya’ put yo’ stank on it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your usual reaction when you see your manipulations being posted by news outlets as real, &#8216;never seen before&#8217; photographs? What&#8217;s the craziest story you&#8217;ve come across as a result of one of your remixes?</strong><br />
&#8220;I really don&#8217;t set out for that to happen, but it often does and I love that shit LOL. I always try and let them know, but they rarely ever get the message or just ain&#8217;t tryna hear it and it gets out of hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been so many crazy things that have transpired out of one of my pics going viral I can&#8217;t even remember half of them. Nothing beats an official shout out from Dre, come on man.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>In times when the very concept of &#8216;truth&#8217; and &#8216;fact&#8217; are being put into interpretation, what do you think is the role of photography in this new &#8216;post-truth&#8217; scenario? Does work like yours serve to expose media manipulation and make lies even more evident, or on the contrary, does it vindicate fabrication?</strong><br />
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t put much thought into that. I&#8217;m sure I have added a little skepticism to the visual experience online though. Sight is our most powerful sense and the hardest to fool. The lies are in the presentation, not the dish. For the most part, it&#8217;s just laziness that&#8217;s the real problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;These pictures would have been dangerous 50-60 years ago, but we are living in an age of information and ignorance is a choice for a lot of folks. I guess in some weird way, I am exposing the misleading sources by unintentionally baiting them.</p>
<p>&#8220;A picture can tell a good story and not all stories are true. Check your facts, folks. If you&#8217;re unsure, Google that shit and read multiple sources. But for real, if anything I&#8217;m improving history, not taking away from it lol Mike Tyson shared a pizza with a couple Ninja Turtles?! Shiiiiiit.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever thought about experimenting with video? Maybe Deepfakes?</strong><br />
&#8220;I have been wanting to get into that. It&#8217;s a time issue though. Not a lot of time to learn so it will be a while before you see any video Vemix&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Ok, let&#8217;s get serious here. Is it true you and Bansky are in constant contact and even have a secret handshake and all?</strong><br />
&#8220;Pretty much. It’s more of an inside joke that we share where I send him little messages of admiration and he doesn&#8217;t respond or even leave me on &#8216;Seen&#8217;, it&#8217;s really cute. Fuck, I could be Bansky for all you know.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Which of your fictional musical collaborations do you think would&#8217;ve actually worked in real life? and which ones do you think would&#8217;ve sucked?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Oooo that&#8217;s a good one. Hmmm. I would love to hear Nate Dogg singing the hook on a Fleetwood Mac song, that&#8217;d definitely be dope. Or Biggie on a Suicidal Tendencies track. I don&#8217;t see Pac and Kurt meshing well in spite of how often I put them together LOL.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Your top five favourite albums of all time?</strong><br />
<em>&#8220;Licence to Ill</em> &#8211; Beastie Boys<br />
<em>In Utero</em> &#8211; Nirvana<br />
<em>40oz to Freedom</em> &#8211; Sublime<br />
<em>All Eyez on Me</em> &#8211; 2pac<br />
<em>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</em> &#8211; Wu-Tang Clan</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;number 6 and 7 would be The Pixies and Mazzy Star.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>HARRY SHUNK AND JANOS KENDER, SELF-PORTRAIT, ITALY, 1966.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-137352" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/p.86-87-e1563813371459.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="399" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>FRANCOIS DUFRENE IN HIS STUDIO, PARIS, 1963.</em></p>
<p>Between 1958 and 1973, German Harry Alexander Shunk (1924-2006) and his Hungarian partner János Kender (1938-2009) collaborated with nearly 300 European and American artists to document some of the most iconic moments in modern art.</p>
<p>Together, they produced some 190,000 images in collaboration with artists including Man Ray, Roy Lichtenstein, Lou Reed, Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Carolee Schneemann, William Klein, and Yayoi Kusama — many of which have become an integral part of the history of art, and works worthy of veneration themselves.</p>
<p>“In the history of photography, ‘documents for artists’ exist in the shade, with a few rare exceptions,” writes Florian Ebner in an essay that appears in the new book, <a href="https://www.artbook.com/9782365112369.html"><em>Shunk-Kender: Art Through the Eye of the Camera 1957–1983</em></a> (Éditions Xavier Barral), which accompanies the first exhibition of their work, now on view at the <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/agenda/event.action?param.id=FR_R-ada9a87ff34e94112e61fcee8948bc30&amp;param.idSource=FR_E-ada9a87ff34e94112e61fcee8948bc30">Centre Pompidou</a> in Paris through August 5, 2019.</p>
<p><span id="more-137349"></span></p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, Ebner came across the making of one of their most famous images, Yves Klein’s legendary <em>Le Saut dans le vide (The Leap into the Void)</em>, made in 1960. Anyone who has ever gazed upon this sensation image may have found themselves overcome with wonder and awe, enthralled by Klein’s fearless daring and the photographers’ flawless timing.</p>
<p>Though their names are largely unknown, Shunk and Kender were a vital force in the communication and preservation of the emerging forms of ephemeral art, from the installation and the happening to the dance and performance. But they didn’t simply document what they saw: they brought the eye of the artist to the work of art to ensure to capture the fleeting moment of transcendent genius.</p>
<p>Shunk and Kender’s photographed historic acts like Niki de Saint Phalle’s <em>Tirs</em>, where she took aim at objects at Impasse Ronsin in Paris in 1961 — and blasted them with a shotgun. These moments, which came to redefine the possibilities of Western art, were witnessed by a select few and then made legendary by the photographs of Shunk-Kender.</p>
<p>Their images ensured that that what could not be bought or sold was forever available to those who understood art was more than a commodity to be consumed by capitalists — it was a profoundly primal, ritualistic experience that empowers us to seek deeper knowledge, understanding, and wisdom about the human condition and the universe.</p>
<p>Consider the work of Gordon Matta-Clark, which Shunk-Kender photographed, and imagine how much of what we know of his work is a result of their documents. It is like this, page after page, artists after artist, one constant reveals itself: that without Shunk and Kender, an important chapter in the history of modern art would have been lost.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>E.J. Pence, competitive bodybuilder South Beach, 1990</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-137384" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Barry-Lewis-6-e1563816636989.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="411" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Ocean Drive, South Beach, 1992</em></p>
<p>As with nearly every major city across the United States, Miami Beach was reduced to a shell of its former self. As the Nixon White House policy of “benign neglect” systemically denied basic government services to Black and Latinx communities, white flight caused the economy to plummet into the abyss.</p>
<p>Nixon’s attack on minority communities didn’t stop there as he invented the “War on Drugs” in 1971 as a way to criminalize the Black community and build the foundation for the prison industrial complex, in which legal slavery openly flourishes across the nation.</p>
<p>Under the weight of state-sponsored terrorism against the very citizens it purported to serve, cities collapsed into a horrific vortex of poverty, crime, illness, and death. Miami Beach was particularly hard hit as it became the stomping grounds for Colombian drug cartel during the 1970s and ‘80s. By the time Fidel Castro emptied the jails and sent 125,000 Cubans to Miami on the Mariel Boat Lift in 1980, Miami Beach’s glory days as tourist destination were a thing of distant memory.</p>
<p><span id="more-137377"></span></p>
<p>Invariably, the destruction of Miami Beach did not last long, for wealthy South American investors and American real estate developers recognized a bargain when they saw one. By the end of the 1980s, the turn about had begun, and businesses like art galleries, nightlife, restaurants, and hotels began their return, ushering in a new age of wholesale gentrification.</p>
<p>British photographer and filmmaker <a href="http://barrylewisphotography.com/">Barry Lewis</a> was in the mix, documenting the early years of gentrification in his new book <a href="https://www.hoxtonminipress.com/products/miami-beach-1988-1995"><em>Miami Beach 1988-1995 </em></a>(Hoxton Mini Press). His photographs bring us back to a pivotal time in the city’s history, when the power brokers were able to capitalize on a community profoundly devastated, and begin to erase them from what little they were able to retain.</p>
<p>“The tourists were returning, promenading down Ocean Drive and Washington Avenue, mingling with the Latinos, gays, transvestites, crazies and kids step-dancing along the sidewalk with beatboxes to their ears,” Lewis writes. “In the background, real estate agents, unnatural in their sharp suits, could be seen eyeing up the crumbling deserted hotels. ‘For Sale’ boards soon went up, rapidly followed by ‘Sold’ signs; property was hot and the sharks were circling.”</p>
<p>It’s an ominous image that underscores the larger capitalist enterprise that has been decimating cities across the nation over the past three decades. As Lewis’s photographs skims along the surface, we are taken for a ride as any tourist might see Miami Beach through this pivotal era of gentrification.</p>
<p>Attracted to the buoyant and flamboyant in equal part, Lewis’s photographs embrace the raucous, the curious, and the quirky in equal part. We see Miami beach as an outsider would, enjoying the city on holiday, knowing we are here for a good time, not a long time, to paraphrase Drake. This Miami Beach is nobody’s home; it doesn’t even seem to belong to the people who live there. They, like the beaches and the nightclubs, are sights to be savored and enjoyed — the picture perfect American postcard of capitalism at work and at play.</p>
<p>Lewis’s photographs are lush, vivid, and alluring scenes of a city in transition, its survivors disappearing in plain sight, and in there place a new world emerging that exists for those who can afford its pleasures, any time of day or night. Even, as Lewis acknowledges, the 1997 assassination of Gianni Versace couldn’t slow things down. “It was soon fine to do selfies in the spot Versace died,” Lewis writes, the ultimate epitaph to all that was sacred about Miami Beach.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Montserrat, Lesser Antilles, December 1982</em></p>
<p>Back in 1979, while watching television in his New York hotel room, British rock star <a href="https://andysummers.com/">Andy Summers</a> had a revelation: “I should get a <em>real </em>camera,” he writes in an essay that appears in the new monograph, <a href="https://utpress.utexas.edu/andy-summers-a-certain-strangeness"><em>A Certain Strangeness</em></a> (University of Texas Press).</p>
<p>“Our band, the Police, was moving fast in the US. With pockets suddenly stuffed with dollars and what they called ‘media attention,’ we were a hot new band. You could feel it in this city, where already our names were being called out in the streets. It was fun, but sitting around and staring at the walls of hotel rooms was boring, and we need diversions.”</p>
<p>Summers goes on to recount the experience of being in front of he camera, posing for snaps, and realizing he was intrigued by the way photographers went about their business. He decided to buy a camera and immediately took to the streets, like a duck to water, equally at home with a guitar as he was with a Nikon FE. <span id="more-137391"></span></p>
<p>Summers made photographs like the Police made songs: instantly recognizable and compelling, yet consistently surprising and unlike anything you were expecting. As you page through the book, a poetry emerges like the lyrics of the song — and a little black spot on the sun today slowly finds its way on to silver gelatin paper.</p>
<p>Here, Summers takes us for a trip around the earth, yet his is the eye of an artist, not pop star. The frames he composes and chooses for the book are epic scenes of life that are at once mundane and magnificent. They are a way of looking and seeing the world that are rich and resonant with a sensitivity to the moment: a sense of being fully present and discovering that which is hiding in pain sight — the eternal, ethereal mystery of the this thing we call life.</p>
<p>In 1983, the band took a break before recording their magnum opus, <em>Synchronicity, </em>and Summers came to New York in search of a book publisher. His agent introduced to him to a man named Joe, who just so happened to print for no less than Robert Frank. They called Ralph Gibson to see if he would do the layout, and Gibson signed up the book, <em>Throb</em>, for his company, Lustrum Press.</p>
<p>Working with Gibson was the turning point; not only did Summers meet Mary Ellen Mark, Larry Clark, and Duane Michaels but he got himself a Leica and with that everything changed. “With this camera I felt as if I was finally stepping onto the true path,” he writes.</p>
<p>That year, <em>Syncronicity</em> and <em>Throb </em>were released, and a phenomenal wave of success came into Summers’ life — and then, after it peaked, it all came to a complete end. “We had enjoyed a phenomenal run unequaled by anyone apart from the Beatles, so coming out of it to a dead stop was a hallucinatory experience,” he writes.</p>
<p>“A psychological black hole where the reality and intensity of a life so full was suddenly torn away, and you had to make a fantastic and painful adjustment to new strange conditions — like everyday life…”</p>
<p>But perhaps it was in this space, in the absence of public adoration and commercial success, that Summers’ honed his eye to rediscover the magic of life in the silent stillness of the single photograph — and in doing so reconnected to everything that made the Police one of the biggest bands on earth.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Sophia Loren May 1963. In costume on the Spanish set of Anthony Mann’s ‘The Fall<br />
of the Roman Empire’ Queen magazine</em></p>
<p>British fashion photographer <a href="http://www.terencedonovan.co.uk/">Terence Donovan</a> embodies the quintessential rags-to-riches tale but a modern twist: for all of his commercial success, a darkness cast a pall, and leading the legendary lensman to commit suicide at the age of 60, in 1996.</p>
<p>Although he made his name in the Swinging Sixties as part of the “Black Trinity” that included fellow fashion photographers David Bailey and Brian Duffy, Donovan rarely exhibited his work. &#8216;Terence didn&#8217;t want to look back,&#8217; Robin Muir, former photo editor of British Vogue told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/mar/15/features11.g23"><em>The Guardian</em></a> in 1999. &#8216;I think it is very much part of his generation&#8217;s way of approaching photography not to see themselves as artists, but as people who pick up the camera and then move on.”</p>
<p>Now, a new exhibition shines a light on his iconic work. <a href="https://huxleyparlour.com/exhibitions/terence-donovan-the-1960s/"><em>Terence Donovan: The 1960s – Vintage Prints from the Archive </em></a>on view Huxley-Parlour in London through July 27, 2019, presents sections of his most famous images alongside rarely-seen works. The exhibition begins in 1959, when Donovan, then 22, opened his first London studio, and charts his career as he came to define the look of post-war Britain’s first youthquake — a time of sex, frocks, and rock &amp; roll that still reverberates today. <span id="more-137079"></span></p>
<p>Hailing form the Stepney neighborhood of East London, Donovan was born in 1936 to a lorry driver and a cook. Following the war, he studied at the Lindon Country School of Photoengraving and Lithography, taking his first photograph at the age of 15. The bombed-out landscape of London became an integral part of Donovan’s aesthetic, allowing him to strike the perfect balance between grit and glamour in his fashion photography.</p>
<p>The exhibition features portraits of iconic starts of the time including Julie Christie, Terence Stamp, Monica Vitti, Sophia Loren, Claudia Cardinale, and Dave Brubeck, alongside eight original and unique contact prints, which Donovan meticulously reviewed and pierced with a pen or marked with a chinagraph pencil or pen. He discarded the frames he did not want, keeping only those he felt met his standards for print.</p>
<p>Donovan came to the forefront of fashion photography just as the glossies became a pop-culture phenomenon, dictating the possibilities for fashion and beauty not only for the haute monde, but for the aspiring bourgeoisie with money to burn.</p>
<p>Donovan’s noirish photographs offered moments of drama and repose, feeding youth fantasies about the ever-growing culture of self. But Donovan did not rest on his own laurels — he was driven to create, branching out into film production in the early 1970s. In total he made some 3,000 TV commercials along with <em>Yellow Dog</em> (1973), a rarely seen feature film, and perhaps most memorably, the work he did directing the music video for Robert Palmer’s “Addicted to Love” — which earned him a nomination from <em>Vanity Fair</em> as one of the “Men of the Decade.”</p>
<p>In his final interview, published just weeks after his death, <a href="http://www.martynmoore.com/donovan.html">Martyn Moore</a> quotes Donovan as saying. &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in illustrating the upbeat things of life, I&#8217;m not riveted by the downbeat. I know a lot about the downbeat but it doesn&#8217;t intrigue me to record it.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center">The Golden Gate Bridge from above, San Francisco, USA 1953</p>
<p>Magnum photographer <a href="http://www.wernerbischof.com/">Werner Bischof</a> (1916-1954) arrived in the United States a year before his death and spent 1953 traveling across the continent. His series <em><a href="http://www.davidhillgallery.net/exhibitions">USA</a></em>, currently on view at David Hill Gallery in London through July 26, 2019, is a vivid portrait of the nation as it rose to become a global superpower.</p>
<p>While most of his contemporaries were firmly entrenched in the tradition of black and white, Bischof broke free, using color to capture both the mood of a place and the quality of life, creating lyrical poems of extraordinary nuance and depth. The exhibition features a selection of 25 photographs that reveal his experiments in color and motion to capture the sensations of being in a rapidly modernizing country possessed with entirely too much faith in itself. <span id="more-137203"></span></p>
<p>Writing in his diary in 1953, Bischof’s recorded his immediate impression of New York City as a “mechanized” and “numb” existence. “Now I realize what Chaplin’s <em>Modern Times</em> was really about,” the Swiss photographer revealed, recognizing the inherent dehumanization of the capitalist enterprise.</p>
<p>On outsider in a foreign land, Bischof used his feelings of isolation and alienation to paint a picture of an eerie, dystopian land. People are shadowy figures, symbolic avatars for the idea of life, strip mined of identity and ever-replaceable. It’s a telling observation about a country that prides itself in the pursuit of happiness, of an unbridled faith in individuality and exceptionalism.</p>
<p>Instead, Bischof sees what the marginalized already knew: America’s rise to power is predicated on the consumption of human capital. It’s a truth just hitting the privileged hard in 2019, but more than 60 years ago Bischof saw the truth. America is a monument to itself: the decimation of a landscape, the destruction of its peoples, and the ever-present reality of corruption and theft all to build monuments to itself.</p>
<p>In Bischof’s <em>USA</em>, the nation is reduced to its deepest core: a series of constructions that over time are abandoned in favor of something more. That more is the belief that consumption, under the guise of ideology, is in itself enough. It’s an eerily prescient portrait of a nation that shamelessly feeds upon itself —just like Kronos devouring his children in a sordid and hapless attempt to alter fate.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137336" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-7.59.48-PM.png" alt="" width="604" height="422" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-7.59.48-PM.png 604w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-20-at-7.59.48-PM-300x210.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<p>I consider myself a somewhat unusual breed of photographer. While I once was an aspiring photographer with a passion for taking my own photos, about a decade ago I transitioned to the other side of the lens (so to speak) and founded Feature Shoot as a way to showcase the amazing work of other photographers I was coming across. </p>
<p>These days, the act of taking photos is almost like therapy for me. It&#8217;s a meditative state. It represents a time and place where I can stop and smell the roses. I mean that literally: most of my own work revolves around flowers &#8211; perhaps a bee buzzing around a flower, or even a reflection of a bee and a flower. Not very original &#8211; I know &#8211; but that&#8217;s not my point. <span id="more-137334"></span></p>
<p>For the last few years, my camera of choice has been whatever has been available on my phone. It&#8217;s convenient, and it does not require me to think a lot. I can fully immerse myself in the subject matter without breaking concentration or having to worry too much about settings. </p>
<p>At the same time, I am a photo editor. So I have spent countless hours on meticulous color correction and retouching. Image quality matters to me &#8211; a lot.</p>
<p>When OnePlus recently invited me to Taipei to test out their new camera on the <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/7pro#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>, I joined an international group of journalists to learn about their new, updated camera. </p>
<p>One of the first things I discovered was that the OnePlus 7 Pro is aimed at people who, like me, want to be able to take a photograph and have it come out close to perfect without a lot of fuss. I spent the first morning of the trip experimenting with all of the different settings and features of the camera, and I was easily able to find my sweet spot. </p>
<p>Which brings me to the first thing to love about the OnePlus 7 Pro.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137339" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_002915.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="827" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_002915.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_002915-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_002915-610x814.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Intuitive Design</strong><br />
It took me less than a minute to capture shots with great detail and almost perfect exposure. With almost no effort on my part, I was able to work out all of the settings and features of the camera that I needed (as well as some that I didn&#8217;t). I opened up the selfie mode and was surprised to have a 16-megapixel selfie camera pop out from the top of the phone. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137335" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OnePlus.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="996" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OnePlus.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OnePlus-187x300.jpg 187w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OnePlus-610x980.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Not something I see myself using a lot, but a unique feature that I can see benefiting a lot of photographers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137340" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_102705.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="827" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_102705.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_102705-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190710_102705-610x814.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Performs Well in Low Light</strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/7pro#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnePlus7 Pro</a> has a &#8220;nightscape&#8221; mode. However, it often prompted me to hold the phone steady for a few seconds before it took the photo, which, for me, is a deal-breaker. Instead, I took all of my night images using the &#8220;photo&#8221; mode, which required zero wait time. I’m happy to report that my images still came out clear with low grain.</p>
<p><strong>3. All Screen Display</strong><br />
The fact that I can see my images full screen on the phone is a game-changer. It&#8217;s the first all-screen phone out there, so it&#8217;s truly a unique find. Plus, the images are ultra-crisp on the 6.7-inch display.</p>
<p><strong>4. 48 Megapixels!</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not a secret that more photographers are choosing to use their phones over traditional digital cameras. Camera sales have been falling for the past few years, and smartphone companies are treating professional photographers with total respect (even if they represent a small fraction of their target market). OnePlus is no exception. They&#8217;ve upped the game: the camera on the OnePlus 7 Pro boasts 48 Megapixels. With imagery this size, the possibilities are endless for professional photographers and non-professionals alike.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137338" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190709_235148__01.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="778" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190709_235148__01.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190709_235148__01-239x300.jpg 239w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190709_235148__01-610x765.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p><strong>5. What Mode Are You In?</strong><br />
For those interested in more than video, photo, portrait, and nightscape modes, dig a little, and you&#8217;ll find advanced settings, such as Pro, Time-lapse, Slow motion, and Panorama. The Pro mode allows photographers to shoot in the beloved RAW file format and also control exposure, shutter speed, and ISO.</p>
<p><strong>6. To Edit or Not To Edit?</strong><br />
Photographers are protective and particular when it comes to color correction. I should know: as a photo editor, I&#8217;ve had plenty of photographers insist on doing their own color correction or request final approval of any color changes we made before the images went to print.</p>
<p>I have never had an image come out absolutely perfect the first time with my camera phone, and I&#8217;m somewhat old school in that I like to download the images to my desktop and open them in Photoshop to edit.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 7 Pro frees me of this laborious step. Not only are the <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/7pro#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnePlus 7 Pro</a> photo editing tools fun to use, but they are also intuitive. Much to my surprise, when I downloaded all of the images from my trip to my desktop, I sometimes preferred the images straight from the phone to those that I had spent time color correcting.</p>
<p><strong>7. Everything You Need (and more, if you want it)</strong><br />
This phone has everything for the amateur photographer (me) and lots more bells and whistles for professionals. What I love most about it is the simplicity of the design. Everything I want to use is right up front. If I decide to get a bit more serious again down the line, then a deeper dive gives me plenty of additional options. The OnePlus 7 Pro meets my needs perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> <em>OnePlus sponsored an education trip to their Image R&amp;D Center in Taiwan. International media, including myself, were flown to Taiwan to learn how OnePlus develops its camera capabilities. OnePlus is not a sponsor of Feature Shoot, and these views are my own.</em></p>

<p>If you like music, it’s very likely that you’ve seen the work of Kerstin Rodgers, one of the prime documentarians of the punk scene in London and one of the most influential rock’n’roll photographers of all time.</p>
<p>That classic image of a young and coy Morrisey wearing an oversized knit sweater, those scenes of The Cramps ferociously blasting on stage as if their lives depended on it, or Madness doing their trademark “nutty train” &#8230; that’s all Kerstin. She’s one of the <em>many</em> unsung lens warriors who one beer-stained night at a time, helped define the iconography of rock in the late 70s and early 80s.</p>
<p>She got her photos published in New Musical Express as a teenager, and since then her work has been printed on the pages of almost every prestigious musical and news outlet under the sun. She’s exhibited in galleries in Paris and London, and was included in the Getty Image Library exhibition, ‘Beat Positive’.</p>
<div id="attachment_137299" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137299" class="size-full wp-image-137299" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-2.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="620" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-2.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-2-610x610.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p id="caption-attachment-137299" class="wp-caption-text">Madness, January 1st 1980. © Kerstin Rodgers</p></div>
<p>But her story is as weird, fascinating and unique as they come. Although Rodger’s impact in the music industry is immense, over the last decade she has become an Internet celebrity for very different reasons.<span id="more-137295"></span></p>
<p>In the new millennium, Kerstin became <a href="https://msmarmitelover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“MsMarmitelover”</a>, one of the biggest influencers in the food and drink world. </p>
<p>Yes, she also happens to be a professional cook who shook up the food industry with the introduction of the underground restaurant movement into the UK in 2009. She’s been one of the very first to adopt the Airbnb model into the scene, hosting a series of thematic <a href="http://supperclubfangroup.ning.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8216;supper clubs&#8217;</a> at her home that kickstarted a trend that still goes on today.</p>
<p>Over the years she has also organized anarchist cafés, indie music festivals and other happenings all revolving around gastronomy. </p>
<p>As MsMarmitelover, she’s published a handful of cooking and recipe books, has written guest posts for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kerstin-rodgers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, and has been featured heavily in the British press for her foodie exploits.</p>
<p>We had the pleasure of talking to Kerstin about her career in photography, the Madness hit song dedicated to her, and her gastronomical entrepreneurship.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s hop on a Delorean and go back to the late 70s. Can you tell us how you got involved in photography in the first place, and in rock’n’roll photography in particular?</strong><br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a photographer since I was 9 years old. My parents bought me an Instamatic camera and I was obsessed with shooting pictures. At school assembly, I used to look at the girls on stage and imagine how I would style and shoot them.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a teenager, I loved music; I went to a gig virtually every night. Every pub had a live band and it was very cheap to get in. </p>
<p>&#8220;Back then, rock n rock was the <em>rock n roll</em>. For the last decade, food has been the new &#8216;rock n roll&#8217;. My daughter goes to more restaurants, pop-ups and street stalls than gigs. </p>
<p>&#8220;Live music is so expensive now, but when I was young, you literally never ate out except on holiday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a boyfriend who was a rockabilly with a stiff hair sprayed quiff. I lost my virginity to him in the back of my mums Honda. He was so cool, but I wasn&#8217;t allowed to touch his hair under any circumstances. One night, I complained he was often late to pick me up. He replied: &#8216;Of course I love you. I got you chips didn&#8217;t I?'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What gear do you usually use? What is your technical approach in those unpredictable, low light conditions?</strong><br />
&#8220;In the analogue days, I used Nikons, FM, FE, on manual. I used a Hasselblad and a light meter and Elinchrom flash. Then I became a single mother and couldn&#8217;t afford to shoot anymore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital changed all that. </p>
<p>&#8220;Now I use Canons &#8211; I have a Canon 6D &#8211; and I use my iPhone. I&#8217;m on the iPhone upgrade programme, so I upgrade every year. I love Instagram, but I prefer the Stories which you can use like a notebook. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have many followers on Instagram so please follow me: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/msmarmitelover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">msmarmitelover</a>!</p>
<p>&#8220;In low light conditions, I hold my breath! I can shoot fairly steadily at 1/30th of a second. I prefer not to use flash but I will on occasion. Or up the ASA. Obviously, with digital, it’s all different now.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137301" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137301" class="size-full wp-image-137301" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-4.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="400" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-4.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-4-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-4-610x394.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p id="caption-attachment-137301" class="wp-caption-text">Lux Interior, 1984, © Kerstin Rodgers</p></div>
<p><strong>You photographed most of the greatest bands of the Punk and New Wave movements. Was there any act that you would’ve liked to photograph but never got the chance?</strong><br />
&#8220;In terms of punk stars, I&#8217;d have liked to have shot the Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Damned and The Jam. I shot Sid Vicious. In fact, my first front page was a pic of Sid and Nancy &#8211; with Lemmy, but they cropped him out &#8211; taken a month before Sid killed Nancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But actually, I&#8217;d like to have shot Judy Garland, preferably from the pit at Carnegie Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How did you approach these rock stars in order to photograph them? What did you do to bring out of them such iconic moments?</strong><br />
&#8220;The Sid picture, I just went up to him and asked if I could take a picture. You have to be pushy in certain kinds of photography. I asked Joan Jett on the same night but she was a right cow and refused. So much for feminist solidarity!</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise, I was commissioned by the NME and record companies to shoot groups in the studio.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137302" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137302" class="size-full wp-image-137302" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-3.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="400" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-3.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-3-610x394.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p id="caption-attachment-137302" class="wp-caption-text">King Kurt, 1980, © Kerstin Rodgers</p></div>
<p><strong>Can you share with us the story behind ‘My Girl&#8217;, the Madness song about you?</strong><br />
&#8220;I was going out with Mike Barson, the songwriter, arranger and pianist of the group. On our first date, he said: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to be a pop star&#8217;. I believed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also shot all the pictures of Madness for the first three years, helping to create their image. Karl, Chas Smash, the dancer, were all brilliant to photograph, so I suggested that they all did dancing like Karl. The &#8216;nutty train&#8217; came about because I was shooting them in such a small studio, I had to fit them in somehow. There were seven of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, the minute Madness got their first record deal and got famous, they dropped me and employed a posh photographer who basically imitated what I&#8217;d done, but in a &#8216;cleaner&#8217; and more polished way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I was with Mike, this happened because of nasty inter-band politics. Can&#8217;t use his girlfriend-type thing even though I&#8217;d spent years shooting them for free, developing and printing late into the night. Since then, they keep using my photographs without crediting or paying me. It&#8217;s very hurtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;They get royalties every time one of their songs are played, so why are they so selfish with me? As a photographer, your back catalogue is your pension. I really should take legal action against them but it&#8217;s so hard to do that against a band you thought were friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jZ4CSzeHO9M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Is there any band today that excites you as much as the seminal acts of the late 70s and early 80s?</strong><br />
&#8220;I loved The Prodigy and was very sad when Keith Flint died. I&#8217;d have liked to have shot him. I like Daft Punk&#8217;s music. I loved Amy Winehouse and shot her at Glasto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, music has lost its way. It&#8217;s all so manufactured and synthetic sounding but not in a good way. White music, in particular, is lost. Black music keeps innovating.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting into a bit of country. I love Jimmy Webb&#8217;s songs.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_137303" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137303" class="size-full wp-image-137303" src="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-7.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="415" srcset="https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-7.jpg 620w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-7-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.featureshoot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-shoot-kerstin-rodgers-7-610x408.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /><p id="caption-attachment-137303" class="wp-caption-text">Madness, 1980, © Kerstin Rodgers</p></div>
<p><strong>Over the last two decades, you’ve turned into an online personality because of your cooking entrepreneurship. Are you as active in the rock’n’roll circuit as before?</strong><br />
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not as active as before in terms of the music scene. Women tend not to be because we spend our money on children and the house and we have less disposable income than men. I see husbands of friends with massive music collections while the wife has no money to spend on herself. Germaine Greer talks about this. </p>
<p>Yes, I am a radical feminist. Not a lesbian though, I fancy men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, things are different now, it&#8217;s all streaming. Which is why live concerts are so expensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I remain curious and interested and open to anything.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In a blog article titled <a href="https://msmarmitelover.com/2009/05/never-boil-bollocks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8216;Never boil the bollocks&#8217;</a>, you talk about how punk was a reaction to the overblown beast that mainstream rock of the era had become, and you draw parallels with your underground dining movement, which was itself a reaction to the excesses of the restaurant industry circa 2008. How’s the restaurant scene today? What’s the post-punk phase of supper clubs?</strong><br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking that food has jumped the shark in the same way that music did. With supper clubs, which was a grassroots movement, unfortunately, the usual suspects have taken over and grabbed the limelight. </p>
<p>&#8220;You know them, the ones with connections and money for PRs, the young and the pretty, the women that don&#8217;t look like they eat. I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a supper club if it&#8217;s in a restaurant. Sorry, not sorry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in part a movement to promote female chefs and cooks who couldn&#8217;t work in a normal restaurant due to family responsibilities. It was good for retired chefs who didn&#8217;t want to spend 16 hour days in restaurants but still loved cooking for an audience. </p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner parties are one thing but cooking for money adds a special kind of pressure &#8211; it keeps you on your toes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still run supper clubs in my home (as well as doing pop-ups elsewhere). I still keep the flame burning. The future of supper clubs? It&#8217;s great for tourism, an opportunity for travelers to experience eating in someone&#8217;s home and meeting locals.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>What’s the most punkish recipe you got?</strong><br />
&#8220;Punk was never very foodie, unlike the hippy movement, who loved cooking and food. Hippies invented the veggie burger, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Punk was about alcohol and drugs and not being healthy. </p>
<p>&#8220;However, animal rights is a punk issue. I wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/V-Vegan-Kerstin-Rodgers/dp/1849496781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>V is for Vegan</em></a>, which is very punk influenced in design. The cover looks like <em>Never mind the Bollocks</em>. It was the first full-color glossy vegan cookbook in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;Style wise, perhaps my mosaic of beetroot and radish with horseradish dressing from <em>V is for Vegan</em>.</p>
<p>I went viral in China for a while with my stargazy pie and chocolate aubergines &#8211; which was featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/t-magazine/dark-cuisine-ugly-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times recently</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Any future books on the horizon?</strong><br />
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to do a second Supper Club book. I&#8217;ve been concentrating on food and travel. Travel is where I get my inspiration for recipes, so I&#8217;d like to do some books on that. Vegetarian travel books. I’m very geeky about food. I like to explore how it was grown, how it’s made, everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;For my most recent book, the <em>British Organic Carrot Cookbook</em>, I traveled around the UK, meeting and photographing organic farmers, then created 35 recipes, shot and styled them. I’m more interested in farmers than chefs. They are the backbone of our food industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brooklyn-based photographer <a href="https://www.winniewow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winnie Au</a> makes dogs catwalk-ready (pun intended) with fashion pieces inspired by their greatest enemy: the dreaded cone of shame.</p>
<p>The portrait series, simply called <em>Cone of Shame</em>, features the amusing reactions of different dogs to wearing the conical contraptions. The cones were reimagined by costume designer Marie-Yan Morvan as functional sculptures, eschewing stiff plastic for other materials like feathers and eggshells, and turning them into designs inspired by cotton candy and sea urchin, to name a few. <span id="more-137311"></span></p>
<p>According to Au, she came up with the idea for the series to show her love for dogs, as well as turn a stressful experience into a more dignified one. She told Feature Shoot: “With this series, I wanted to take that sad moment and twist it into something beautiful and majestic to take the shame out of the cone. In creating these images, my goal was to highlight and help raise money for rescue dogs who have urgent medical needs.”</p>
<p>We recently caught up with Au to find out more about her and her work.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a little about your background – what path led you to becoming a photographer, and to doing what you’re doing today?</strong><br />
“I was a yearbook photographer in high school, so I learned the basics of photography by shooting and developing black and white film and photographing everything from football games and cheerleaders to the tennis team and mathletes. I wasn’t great at sports and I wasn’t popular, so photography helped me get out of my skin and see a side of high school that I probably would have skipped had I not been involved.</p>
<p>“I then studied communications and advertising at Boston University (because I loved infomercials and wanted to make infomercials), but about halfway through my program, I realized my true passion and natural talent was in photography. My photojournalism teacher Professor Peter Smith had a background in journalism and commercial photography, and he was really the one who let me know that photography could be your full-time job. I didn’t even realize that it was an option until he mentioned it. I had always imagined myself in a career that was full time and practical, like an engineer or scientist.</p>
<p>“Professor Smith suggested I consider photography as a career path, so I got a photography internship with commercial photographer Joshua Dalsimer. Josh is an amazing photographer, wonderful person and still one of my good friends and mentors today. I learned the professional side of photography from him &#8211; how to load medium format film, use strobes, run a clip test, etc. We had a lot of fun working together, and after that internship, I was hooked. I saw a field where your job doesn’t feel like a job, and that was (and still is) pretty appealing.</p>
<p>“Rather than change my major, I took as many photography and visual arts courses as I could, and I got another internship at BBC Good Food magazine in London. By the time I graduated college, I started studio managing and assisting for Joshua Dalsimer and a few other photographers in Boston. After a few years of working, I wanted to expand and learn from more people, so I moved to NYC, where I landed a job as a studio manager and digital tech full time for one year for Richard Corman. Digital photography was just taking off, so I got to see and learn all the fun quirks of working with a developing technology.</p>
<p>“From there I became a freelance digital tech and ended up working for tons of photographers and photo studios and rental houses around NYC. In the blink of an eye, I found myself turning 30 and realized I had come to New York to be a photographer, not a great digital tech or assistant. So I saved my money, fired myself from all my assisting clients, and got work at showing my portfolio and marketing it. I didn’t have work for about six months, but slowly little jobs trickled in. Within a year I was shooting full time, and within a couple of years I signed with the agency This Represents, and I’ve been shooting and repped by them ever since. I photograph people, animals, food, and the spaces where these things live.”</p>

<p><strong>What inspired you to make a photo series based on dogs and their cones of shame?</strong><br />
“I had this series in my head for many years prior to me actually shooting any images for it. I’ve always noticed how comical and ridiculous dogs work when they’re wearing a cone, so that image and shape were sort of burned into my brain. Think of a Rorschach shape but instead of ink blots, my brain was seeing dogs wearing cones. With this series, I wanted to take that sad moment and twist it into something beautiful and majestic to take the shame out of the cone. In creating these images, my goal was to highlight and help raise money for rescue dogs who have urgent medical needs.</p>
<p>“I had a beautiful corgi named Tartine who very sadly got throat cancer not super long after we adopted her. We spent many difficult months in and out of hospitals, and during that time I learned the crazy high cost of medical care for pets. It’s terrible to have to make a medical decision based on finances. We had pet insurance so luckily we didn’t have to. But I want to help other dog owners and animal rescues find the cash for urgent care when they need it. <a href="https://www.animalhavenshelter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animal Haven</a> is a no-kill shelter I am working with whose Recovery Road fund specifically gives funds to their rescues with medical needs.</p>
<p>“I recently funded a Kickstarter campaign to print a set of notecards featuring the series whose proceeds will be donated to Animal Haven’s Recovery Road fund. Anyone who is interested in pre-ordering the notecards or purchasing a print can buy them <a href="https://www.winniewow.com/shop/cone-of-shame-notecard-set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.”</p>

<p><strong>Can you give us a little insight into the creative process involved in the making of <em>Cone of Shame</em>?</strong><br />
“I worked with designer Marie-Yan Morvan to create the cones. I basically would come up with a concept for each shot &#8211; usually I either had an idea for a cone and we matched up a dog with it, or I had a specific dog in mind and we matched a cone to it. For example, for Penelope’s cone the inspiration was an image of a white sea urchin. I sent Marie-Yan some sea urchin photos and a color palette, and then I would ask her, how can we make this into a cone that is safe for a dog to wear and looks like this?</p>
<p>“She came back with a brilliant execution, which was to create the cone out of drinking straws. It had the same form and color as a sea urchin and worked perfectly. Marie-Yan designed each cone and created each one based on whatever inspiration I sent her or that we discussed. For example, with Calvin the Komondor (the moppy looking dog) &#8211; we wanted to create a cone that mimic-ed the dog’s fur texture. So my moodboard had different yarn and fuzzy fabric textures on it. We would print out thumbnails of the backgrounds, colors, dogs, and textures to see what work best together. So ultimately the design was something I collaborated on with Marie-Yan, and she did all of the building of the cones.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>We read that you’re a dog owner too. Did your dogs make a cameo in the series?</strong><br />
“I have a beautiful basset hound named Clementine &#8211; she’s a rescue. She was a puppy mill mom in Ohio. The mill was shut down, and she ended up in foster care with <a href="https://www.tristatebassets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tri State Basset Rescue</a>, where I found her. I fostered her for a week and then adopted her, she was just too squishy and lovable. Huge foster fail.</p>
<p>“Clementine helped out with our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coneofshame/cone-of-shame-notecard-set?ref=user_menu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter campaign</a> (she has a cameo at the end of the video), but as much as I love her, she is just too nervous and skittish around movement and therefore would hate a studio photo shoot. I think if I can set up a special shoot for her one day in my house it would work, but she is not super comfortable in new environments with noise and movement so for now, she is a Cone of Shame supporter, but not a model yet!”</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to make a cat version of this too? Please say yes.</strong><br />
“Ha! I love that idea. I’ll think about it… only if it involves meeting a Maine Coon!”</p>
