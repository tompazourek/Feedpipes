When Jim Stauffer's mother Doris Stauffer died at the age of 73, he sought out a way for her body to be used to further scientific study: she had Alzheimer's but did not carry the genes commonly associated with it, so he thought that her brain might yield further insights into the disease.
<span id="more-729535"></span>
<P>
He donated her remains to Phoenix's Biological Resource Center, not knowing that it was a <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/22/biological-resource-center.html">criminal, for-profit enterprise</a> run by a deluded grifter whose medical knowledge came "from books or the internet." 
Years later, Stauffer was contacted by an investigative journalist from Reuters who was reporting the story, who told him that the Biological Resource Center sold his mother's remains to the military for blast testing, in an procedure that Stauffer explained this way: "She was then supposedly strapped in a chair on some sort of apparatus, and a detonation took place underneath her to basically kind of get an idea of what the human body goes through when a vehicle is hit by an IED."
<P>
Though years have gone by, he remains traumatized by the knowledge of the abuse of his mother's remains.
<p>
Arizona does not require licensing of clinics that handle body donations, and even though the Arizona legislature has adopted legislation to make this a requirement in the wake of the Biological Resource Center scandal, the legislation has not been implemented and is not enforced in Arizona.
<P>
Stauffer is part of a group of families of people whose remains were mutilated by the Biological Resource Center who are suing its former owner, Stephen Gore, who is currently serving a prison sentence related to the Center's activities.

<p>


Stauffer said he specifically marked “no” on a box that would have authorized medical tests involving explosions to be performed.
<p>
Several years have passed since he learned the fate of his mother’s body, but he still struggles with the thought of it daily.
<p>
“I don’t see a pathway of ever getting past this,” he said. “Every time there’s a memory, every time there’s a photograph you look at, there’s this ugly thing that happened just right there staring right at you.”

<P>
There's so much to be delighted by in this review, not least a comparison to Rod Serling (!). Below, a couple paras of especial note.
<P>
<blockquote>
<P>
His latest, a collection of four novellas, subtitled “Four Tales of Our Present Moment”, fits the template perfectly, and extends his vision further into a realm where impassioned advocacy, Upton-Sinclairish muckraking, and Dickensian-Hugonian ashcan realism drives a kind of partisan or Cassandran science fiction seen before mostly during the post-WWII atomic bomb panic (think On the Beach) and 1960s New Wave-Age of Aquarius agitation (think Bug Jack Barron). Those earlier troubled eras resonate with our current quandary, but the “present moment” under Doctorow’s microscope – or is that a sniper’s crosshairs? – has its own unique features that he seeks to elucidate. These stories walk a razor’s edge between literature and propaganda, aesthetics and bludgeoning, subtlety and stridency, rant and revelation. The only guaranteed outcome after reading is that no one can be indifferent to them...
<p>
...The Radicalized collection strikes me in some sense as an episode of a primo TV anthology series – Night Gallery in the classical mode, or maybe in a more modern version, Philip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams. It gives us polymath Cory Doctorow as talented Rod Serling – himself both a dreamer and a social crusader – telling us that he’s going to show us, as vividly as he can, several nightmares or future hells, but that somehow the human spirit and soul will emerge intact and even triumphant.

John Sergeant, CEO of Macmillan, Snowden's publisher (and my own), said, "Edward Snowden decided at the age of 29 to give up his entire future for the good of his country.

A group of MIT Media Lab researchers have published Radiotalk, a massive corpus of talk radio audio with machine-generated transcriptions, with a total of 240,000 hours' worth of speech, marked up with machine-readable metadata.
<span id="more-729522"></span>
<P>
The audio was scraped from streaming radio services between Oct 2018 and Mar 2019, and the transcripts run to 2.8 billion words. The researchers hope the corpus will be used by "researchers in the fields of natural language processing, conversational analysis, and the social sciences."
<P>
I'm mostly interested in the social science implications here: talk radio is incredibly important to the US political discourse, but because it is ephemeral and because recorded speech is hard to data-mine, we have very little quantitative analysis of this body of work.

As Gretchen McCulloch points out in her new book on internet-era language, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/24/sparkles-and-allcaps.html">Because Internet</a>, research on human speech has historically relied on expensive human transcription, leading to very small and corpuses covering a very small fraction of human communication.

This corpus is part of a shift that allows social scientists, linguists and political scientists to study a massive core-sample of spoken language in our public discourse.

The corpus is intended for use by researchers in the fields of natural language processing, conversational analysis, and the social sciences. The corpus encompasses approximately 2.8 billion words of automatically transcribed speech from 284,000 hours of radio, together with metadata about the speech, such as geographical location, speaker turn boundaries, gender, and radio program information. In this paper we summarize why and how we prepared the corpus, give some descriptive statistics on stations, shows and speakers, and carry out a few high-level analyses.

<p>
Laura Poitras (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22laura%20poitras%22">previously</a>) is the Academy Award-winning director of <em>Citizenfour</em>; she teamed up with the activist group Forensic Archicture (<a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/10/07/agcab.html">previously</a>), whose incredible combination of data-visualization and documentary filmmaking have made them a potent force for holding war criminals and authoritarians to account: together, they created <a href="https://vimeo.com/349933683">Triple Chaser</a>, a short documentary that uses novel machine-learning techniques to document the ways in which tear gas and bullets made by companies belonging to "philanthropist" Warren Kanders have been used against civilians to suppress anti-authoritarian movements, and even to murder innocents, including children.

<span id="more-729507"></span>
<p>
Kanders sat on the board of the Whitney Museum of Art, where Poitras <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/03/02/laura-poitrass-whitney-show.html">had a one-woman show</a> (I <a href="https://boingboing.net/2016/02/04/laura-poitrass-astro-noise.html">contributed to the program book</a>); he is also owner of Safariland, which manufactures the ubiquitous Triple Chaser tear-gas cannisters (Kanders has resigned from the board after the production of this short film).
<P>
When Forensic Architecture was invited to contribute to the Whitney's biennale, they teamed up with Poitras to train a machine-learning system to recognize Triple Chaser cannisters in videos captured by protesters and journalists while they were under assault by security forces. They crowdsourced samples of the Triple Chaser cannisters, then created 3D models of them and placed them on a series of backgrounds to train their classifer. The video is narrated by David Byrne.
<P>
The resulting film -- which documents the production of the machine learning system and its use in identifying Triple Chaser products targeted at peaceful protesters, as well as Kanders' complicity in crimes (including the firing of live ammunition into the Occupied Territories in a massacre that killed many civilians, including children) and his connections to the Whitney -- was submitted to the Whitney for the biennale (to the Whitney's credit, they accepted the film).
<P>
Since then, the film has been withdrawn in protest of Kanders' presence on its board; seven other artists involved the Whitney also pulled their work.
<P>
The activism is part of a wider project to halt the laundering of rich peoples' reputations through philanthropy, a campaign that gained steam with the publications of <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/11/10/say-its-name.html">Anand Giridharadas's <em>Winners Take All</em> in 2018</a>. Early on, much of the focus was on the <a href="https://boingboing.net/tag/sacklers">billionaire Sackler family</a>, who grew richer than the Rockefellers marketing Oxycontin through their family company Purdue Pharma, whose arts donations made their names synonymous with generosity, rather than mass addiction and hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths.
<P>
Since then, the focus has widened to include the involvement of "philanthropists" in antidemocratic technology vendors, which led to the Yana Peel <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/06/18/safe-space-for-unsafe-ideas.html">resigning as CEO of London's Serpentine Gallery</a> over her ownership stake in <a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=nso">The NSO Group</a>, a leading vendor of surveillance technology to brutal dictatorships (their tools are implicated in the murder and dismemberment of US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi).
<P>
Now Kanders is in disgrace over his war profiteering, and there are surely more to come. You don't become a billionaire (or even a hundred-millionaire) through ethical investing: so many of the highest-return sectors are from the oppression economy -- the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-gulag-wealth-fund-and_b_97148?guccounter=1">Gulag Wealth Fund</a> is a really high-return index to bet on.
<blockquote>
<P>
Forensic Architecture also created an open source tool called mtriage that can crawl YouTube to download videos matching certain keywords and dates. It extracts frames from the videos so they can be passed through a machine-learning model to highlight material for closer analysis.
<p>
The Triple Chaser–detector is also intended to plug into mtriage. The software has proven capable of flagging images showing Triple Chaser canisters that it hasn’t seen before, although the team is still working to improve its reliability.
<p>
Poitras’ film ends with new allegations against Kanders, based on evidence gathered by a researcher she brought into the collaboration with Forensic Architecture. It claims that Sierra Bullets, a subsidiary of Clarus Corporation, a public company where Kanders is executive chairman, sells bullets to IMI, a supplier to the Israeli military. The film—and subsequent research by Forensic Architecture—suggest Sierra’s ammunition may have been used against civilians in deadly incidents last year that a UN investigation concluded could have been war crimes. Sierra Bullets, Clarus Corporation, and IMI did not respond to requests for comment.

<p>You can almost hear the narrator drooling as he gleefully describes how Fisher Industries proposes to build a wall between Mexico and the United States, one mile a day, in ten years. </p>
<p>By the way, illegal border crossings have been declining for the last 20 years. "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-border-crisis-reality.html">In 2017, border-crossing apprehensions were at their lowest point since 1971.</a>" (NY Times)</p>
<p>Fisher Industries seems well-suited for a president like Trump. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_Industries">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fischer Industries is a privately-held construction company based in Dickinson, North Dakota, led by Tommy Fisher. It is a child company of Fisher Sand and Gravel.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has lobbied for the company to receive contracts on the US-Mexico Trump wall, to the Department of Homeland Security, to Todd T. Semonite of the Army Corps of Engineers, and promoted the company in an interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity. Jared Kushner has also endorsed the company, as well as freshman North Dakota senator Kevin Cramer, to whose campaign the <strong>Fisher family contributed $10,000</strong>.</p>
<p>Tommy Fisher has appeared on local and conservative TV and radio and is a donor to several charities and the Republican Party. Senator Kramer suggested Fisher's Fox News appearances are what attracted Trump to the company.</p>
<p><em>The High Plains Reader</em> has documented environmental violations and tax evasion by the company, including 169 citations and paying $1 million in air quality violation fines in Maricopa County, Arizona over the past 10 years. In 2009 <strong>Michael Fisher, then-owner of Fisher, pled guilty to nine counts of felony tax fraud</strong>, being sentenced to 37 months in prison and over $300,000 in restitution. The comptroller also pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in 2009. <strong>Another former head of the company, David William Fisher, pled guilty in 2005 to child pornography and was sentenced to 10 years in prison</strong>. He was released on April 30, 2010.</p></blockquote>

"&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/11/us/politics/trump-border-crisis-reality.html"&gt;In 2017, border-crossing apprehensions were at their lowest point since 1971.&lt;/a&gt;" (NY Times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fisher Industries seems well-suited for a president like Trump. From &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_Industries"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fischer Industries is a privately-held construction company based in Dickinson, North Dakota, led by Tommy Fisher. It is a child company of Fisher Sand and Gravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has lobbied for the company to receive contracts on the US-Mexico Trump wall, to the Department of Homeland Security, to Todd T. Semonite of the Army Corps of Engineers, and promoted the company in an interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity. Jared Kushner has also endorsed the company, as well as freshman North Dakota senator Kevin Cramer, to whose campaign the &lt;strong&gt;Fisher family contributed $10,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommy Fisher has appeared on local and conservative TV and radio and is a donor to several charities and the Republican Party. Senator Kramer suggested Fisher's Fox News appearances are what attracted Trump to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The High Plains Reader&lt;/em&gt; has documented environmental violations and tax evasion by the company, including 169 citations and paying $1 million in air quality violation fines in Maricopa County, Arizona over the past 10 years. In 2009 &lt;strong&gt;Michael Fisher, then-owner of Fisher, pled guilty to nine counts of felony tax fraud&lt;/strong&gt;, being sentenced to 37 months in prison and over $300,000 in restitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/08/01/heres-how-fisher-industries.html" class="read-more"&gt;Read the rest &lt;/a&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss xmlns:wfw="http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/">https://boingboing.net/2019/08/01/heres-how-fisher-industries.html/feed</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments xmlns:slash="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/">14</slash:comments><post-id xmlns="com-wordpress:feed-additions:1">729510</post-id><feedburner:origLink>https://boingboing.net/2019/08/01/heres-how-fisher-industries.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Data-mining reveals that 80% of books published 1924-63 never had their copyrights renewed and are now in the public domain</title><link>http://feeds.boingboing.net/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/5JfKQ2JCyHQ/80pct-pd.html</link><category>Post</category><category>books</category><category>Copyfight</category><category>copyright office</category><category>glam</category><category>happy mutants</category><category>hathi trust</category><category>libraries</category><category>nypl</category><category>open data</category><category>public domain</category><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Cory Doctorow</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 10:22:30 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://boingboing.net/?p=729504</guid><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[

This January, we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAUneJpB2vo&feature=youtu.be">celebrated the Grand Re-Opening of the Public Domain</a>, as the onerous terms of the hateful Sonny Bono Copyright Act finally developed a leak, putting all works produced in 1923 into the public domain, with more to follow every year -- 1924 goes PD in 2020, and then 1925, etc.

But there's another source of public domain works: until the 1976 Copyright Act, US works were not copyrighted unless they were registered, and then they quickly became public domain unless that registration was renewed. The problem has been to figure out <em>which</eM> of these works were in the public domain, because the US Copyright Office's records were not organized in a way that made it possible to easily cross-check a work with its registration and renewal. 
<P>
For many years, the Internet Archive has hosted an archive of <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Library+of+Congress.+Copyright+Office.%22">registration records</a>, which were <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals">partially machine-readable</a>.

<p>
Now, Leonard Richardson (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22Leonard%20Richardson%22">previously</a>) has done the magic data-mining work to affirmatively determine which of the 1924-63 books are in the public domain, which turns out to be 80% of those books; what's more, many of these books <a href="https://botsin.space/@SecretlyPublicDomain">have already been scanned</a> by the Hathi Trust (which uses a limitation in copyright to scan university library holdings for use by educational institutions, regardless of copyright status).

"Fun facts" are, sadly, often less than fun. But here's a genuinely fun fact: most books published in the US before 1964 are in the public domain! Back then, you had to send in a form to get a second 28-year copyright term, and most people didn't bother.

Last week, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/26/salesforce-policeforce.html">Motherboard broke a story</a> revealing that Amazon had entered into secret agreements with local law enforcement agencies that had the cops pushing Ring surveillance doorbells to the people they were sworn to protect, in exchange for freebies and access to a system that let them request access to footage recorded by the Amazon's industry-leading internet-of-shit home surveillance tools.
<span id="more-729484"></span>
<P>
Later, a public records request put the number of police departments that had entered into these agreements with Amazon at <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/30/law-enforcement-portal.html">more than 200</a>.
<p>
Now, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/everything-cops-say-about-amazons-ring-is-scripted-or-a-1836812538">a new report from Gizmodo's Dell Cameron</a> reveals the text of the boilerplate agreements that Amazon entered into with cops: under the terms of these deals, cops would be supplied with scripts and graphics that they were to use to promote Amazon products, and would be required to get Amazon's permission to diverge from these premade talking-points and art. The agreements contain a gag-clause that prohibits the cops from disclosing that they were parroting corporate PR, and the clause contained no carve out for public records requests.
<P>
Ring's agreements require cops to encourage citizens to install "Neighbors" -- a "neighborhood watch" app that Ring users can use to report "suspicious characters" captured by their doorbells (unsurprisingly, the reports generated by this app are a racist dumpster-fire). 
<P>
Thankfully, the attorneys who negotiated Boca Raton's Amazon deal crossed out the confidentiality clause, which allowed for all of this to come to light through a public records request.
<p>
Ring gives discounted surveillance doorbells to city employees and supplies products for raffles; the members of the public who win these doorbells are not generally informed that Amazon provides their local law enforcement with comprehensive dossiers on everyone who activates a Ring doorbell, including "where they live, the MAC addresses of each of their devices, and how to reach them by email or phone."

<blockquote>
<P>
Ring appears to take full advantage of the privilege granting it power over police statements. The company actively crafts various types of messages that, to the general public, are seemingly written by the police themselves. Through records requests in California, Florida, and Texas, Gizmodo obtained details about Ring’s so-called “press packets” issued to partnering agencies. These include a “Press Release Template,” “Social Media Templates,” and “Key Talking Points,” as well as high-resolution Ring and Neighbors App logos “to incorporate with PR materials as needed.”
<p>
What’s more, the packets are accompanied by instructions dictating that final drafts of public remarks must be sent to Ring so that the company’s PR team can “review and sign off” before they’re sent to local news outlets. The social media templates, which Gizmodo obtained from the Frisco Police Department, are also widely in use. No fewer than 33 police departments have copied and pasted Ring’s suggested tweet asking residents to “Join us by downloading the free ‘Neighbors’ app.”

<p>The Action Lab Man is a guy who makes good videos of science demonstrations and experiments. In this video he tries to make something called an "Egely Wheel" to spin just by putting his hand near it. I've never heard of an Egely Wheel before I saw this video. Here's what the Action Lab Man said about it: "In this video I bought and Egely Disk Vitality Indicator that supposedly moves through your body's "bio-energy" or telekinesis. Is it true? I test it out myself to see if it truly can move simply through concentration. I test it with gloves on, in a jar, and even in a vacuum chamber."</p>

<p>
Private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR have acquired massive health companies like Teamhealth and Emcare, which bill out doctors to the hospitals they work for, taking those doctors out of the hospitals' insurance agreements and massively hiking their fees -- that's why when you go to a hospital, even one that's covered by your insurer, you still end up with <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/03/14/grifters-in-gowns.html"><em>massive</em> surprise bills for your care</a>.
<span id="more-729479"></span>
<P>
In classic private equity style, the firms behind this gouging have figured out which doctors are the most profitable: emergency care, neonatal intensive care, and anesthesiologists -- these being doctors that you see in times of utmost distress, without the chance to shop around. The NICU targets are especially juicy, because they care for critically ill newborns whose parents are confronting the possibility that their baby will die, and are thus unlikely to haggle over the bill.
<P>
The price hikes are prodigious: "after EmCare took over the management of emergency services at hospitals with previously low out-of-network rates, they raised out-of-network rates by over 81 percentage points. In addition, the firm raised its charges by 96 percent relative to the charges billed by the physician groups they succeeded."
<P>
The private equity buyouts of doctors' groups were (naturally) debt-financed, leaving these price-gouging companies leveraged to the hilt, with investor shares cratering. Not surprisingly, any legislative relief for patients who face these life-destroying surprise bills is immediately targeted for all-out lobbyist blitz attacks, because the holders of the debt and the PE companies that issued it have everything to lose from even the smallest concession to treating health-care's primary purpose as making sick people well again, rather than making plutocrat looters unimaginably wealthy.

    A push on Capitol Hill to stop US patients from being caught unaware by medical bills is weighing on the debt of KKR-backed Envision Healthcare, the target of one of the biggest leveraged buyouts last year…
<p>
    Investors are concerned that a new so-called “surprise billing” law could crimp revenues at companies such as Envision, which employs emergency-room doctors and anaesthetists through its subsidiary EmCare….

In 2008, a security researcher named James Glenn warned Cisco that its video surveillance software had a defect that made it vulnerable to a trivial-to-exploit attack; for four years afterward, the company continued to sell this software to schools, airports, hospitals, state/local governments, the US military, FEMA, the Secret Service and police departments without mitigating the defect or warning their customers that internet-connected randos could undetectably peer through their security cameras, unlock their doors, disable their alarms, and delete footage.
<span id="more-729476"></span>
<P>
Now, Cisco has entered into a settlement with the DOJ, DC and 15 states, and will pay $8.6m to settle all claims against it.
<P>
Despite the fine, Cisco insists that nothing bad happened, because it never detected anyone making an undetectable attack on any of its customers' systems.
<P>
80% of the award money will go to the government agencies, while 20% will go to Glenn and his attorneys, who filed a whistleblower lawsuit after he was fired from Cisco subcontractor Netdesign. 
<p>
There's a lesson here about the people who advocate for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/sdbp/">allowing companies to decide when defects in their products can be revealed</a>: companies are not trustworthy custodians of bad news about their products, even (especially) when the stakes are high and they face titanic liability for failing to mitigate reported defects.

<blockquote>
<p>
Hackers could use the flaw not just to spy on video footage but to turn surveillance cameras on and off, delete footage and even potentially compromise other connected physical security systems such as alarms or locks - all without being detected, according to Hamsa Mahendranathan, an attorney at Constantine Cannon, which represented whistleblower James Glenn.
<p>
The security weakness was also easy to find and exploit, said Michael Ronickher, another Contantine Cannon attorney.
<p>
"It was like the moment in the heist movies when a person types on a laptop for 30 seconds and says 'I'm in,' " Ronickher said.

<p>
Article 31 of the Russian constitution guarantees the right to peaceful political assembly, which is why Russian opposition protesters like to wave copies of the constitution around as Putin's goon-squads descend on them to dole out savage beatings and mass arrests.
<span id="more-729470"></span>
<P>
On Saturday, a 17 year old woman from Moscow named Olga Misik sat down in front of a line of armed, locked and loaded riot cops and quietly read the constitution to them, setting up a photo-op of the genre that includes Tiananmen Square’s Tank Man, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taking_a_Stand_in_Baton_Rouge">Taking a Stand in Baton Rouge</a>, and the photos of a pigtailed, defiant Greta Thunberg standing alone in the cold before the Swedish legislature.
<P>
Misik was part of a protest over the banning of leading opposition politicians from upcoming municipal elections in Moscow. She says that after the protest, she was beset by riot cops who beat her up and then arrested her. She faces charges for "attending a public event which was held without filing a notice."
<P>
Misik is an articulate spokeswoman for protest, grounding her action in a wider context: "Injustice always concerns everyone. Today the Moscow City Duma, tomorrow the governor of the region, a week later the head of the Resurrection District. It is only a matter of time. It is foolish to think that this is a rally only for free elections or the admission of candidates. This is a rally in defence of elementary constitutional rights that would not be questioned in a democratic state."
<p>
The pictures and videos of Misik reading to the riot squad have become a rallying point for the opposition.
<p>
 Misik's father is a Putin supporter.

<blockquote>
<P>
The teenager herself, whose own father is a supporter of Mr Putin, was allowed to walk away after the reading, but was later arrested by police as she walked to a subway station.
<P>
“They did not introduce themselves, did not explain the reason and grounds for detention,” she said.
<p>
“There was not a rally or a crowd of people in this place. They grabbed my arms and legs and dragged me down the street and through the underpass … I screamed that they were hurting me, but they told me that they knew better.”

<p>
Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22matt%20taibbi%22">previously</a>) is one of my favorite political writers, with the style chops of Hunter S Thompson, but without Thompson's often juvenile politics (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/matt.taibbi/posts/10155396934349652">Taibbi having outgrown that phase</a>, something Thompson never managed to do).
<span id="more-729467"></span>
<P>
Taibbi's latest, a massive on-the-ground report from the Iowa campaigns of the Democratic would-be presidential nominees, is like having a bucket of ice-water dashed over your head by someone who's telling genuinely funny jokes about how terrible it all is, that ha-ha-only-serious mode that is becoming the motif for our era, in the <a href="https://boingboing.net/2006/09/16/german-antinazi-joke.html">long tradition</a> of <a href="https://boingboing.net/2006/07/12/soviet-joketelling.html">gallows humor</a> in dire political circumstances.
<p>
Like Thompson, Taibbi's on-the-ground reporting from Iowa is marked out not so much by his insights into the candidates, but rather, his expert and nuanced reading of the animal sentiments they arouse in the crowds they address, and in Taibbi's long memory for other political moments in which similar candidates said similar things to <em>exactly the same people</em> (this being Iowa, which, thanks to a quirk of history, is the hot ticket of American politics).
<p>
Taibbi's read on the Democratic leadership race is that it is doubling down on the GOP's "clown car" blunder, which let Trump take nomination from a crowded field of political same-sames who were unable to confront Trump's "Throw the Bums Out" movement because they were the bums that the body politic wanted thrown out. He sees this as an indictment of the Democratic Party, which might be breathing its last gasp, along with America's commitment to democracy itself: "Lose to Donald Trump once, shame on the voters. Lose to him twice? It’s glue-factory time for the Democratic Party, and another black eye for America, which is fast turning its electoral system into a slapstick reality show."
<p>
Taibbi's criticism is complex and contradictory: he says that the Dems can only win by showing "true inspiration," but Taibbi is also skeptical of the bold policy proscriptions of the likes of Elizabeth Warren ("voters will soon be introduced to the fact that plans and promises similar to the ones Warren is making have been made many times before. It’s not a referendum on her but on how much belief is left out there"). This contradiction is at the heart of the conundrum the Democrats find themselves in: wonkish expertise is a good look for someone who wants to contrast themselves from Trump's chaotic administrative incompetence, but generations of triangulating politicians (most often Democrats) have poisoned the well by using plausible-sounding technocratic language to justify bank bailouts, mass incarceration, betrayals of trade unions and working people, mass privatization and other Clintonian/Obamaesque sins.
<P>
So the Dems are left trying to fit their platforms into Trump-scale tweets: "The Democrats’ basic pitch reads like a list of five poll topics: kids are in cages; let’s close the gun-show loophole; this administration’s policies are an existential threat; something something Mitch McConnell; and Trump is (insert joke here)."
<P>
Combine a crowded field with mere sloganeering and the debates descend into parody: "Mostly the Democrats are taking tweet-size bites out of one another’s hind parts in Heathers-style putdowns, or engaging in virtue-signaling contests, like they’re running for president of Woke Twitter."
<p>
And that's before you get to the candidates themselves: irrelevant plutocrats, self-help gurus, small town mayors, a guy who "lost a Senate bid to the world’s most-hated Republican." If you're into schadenfreude, this is where Taibbi shines, taking no prisoners when it comes to the clowns of Clown Car 2.0.
<P>
Like this take on Biden: "like if Barack Obama were on vacation, or sick, maybe. Biden’s labors to remind us he was the understudy of the last president are painful."
<p>
Meanwhile, Marianne Williamson manages to surprise him by captivating a room full of people in a way that leaves Taibbi half-convinced (and distinctly unhappy) that she is going to take the nomination: "her speech is not a lifeless collection of policy positions. It’s an interesting, tightly written diagnosis of the American problem. Precisely because socioeconomic stresses have pushed them into heightened awareness, she says, the American public sees what she calls 'a transition from democracy to aristocracy,' and the corporate sector’s “insatiable appetite” for money that dominates American life...She describes a two-party system that, at its worst, operates in perfect harmony with the darkest impulses of corporate capitalism, and at best — presumably she refers more to Democrats here — sounds like institutionalized beggary."
<P>
Taibbi also nails the establishment's pitch to sideline the newly ascendant progressive wing of the party: "Do we really have to make radical changes? The centrists want the progressives to step aside for the sake of 'unity,' while the progressives believe they’re the new mainstream and are the better bet in a world where traditional notions of electability are upside-down."
<P>
On the progressive wing, he correctly identifies Sanders as the prime mover, dragging the whole party to the left, radically resizing the Overton window: "The undeniable truth is that the Democratic race is about Sanders. Most of the candidates either support Medicare for All or try to sound like they do. They also tend to support a $15 minimum wage and call for wealth taxes, a Green New Deal, antitrust actions, and some rejection of corporate donors." He also shows how the press have conspired to downplay Sanders' lead ("the highest number of unique donors... the leading fundraiser overall in the race"), with headlines like "Harris, Warren Tie for Third in New Poll, But Biden Still Leads."
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The front-runner — the front-runner! — is septuagenarian gaffe machine Joe Biden, who started running for president in the Eighties and never finished higher than “candidacy withdrawn,” with a career delegate total matching John Blutarsky’s grade-point average, i.e., zero point zero. The summer’s “momentum” challenger is California Sen. Kamala Harris, who spent all year sinking in polls but surged when she hit Biden with “I don’t think you’re a racist . . . but . . .” on national TV.
<p>
A third contender is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a famed red-state punchline who already has 10,000 Pocahontas tweets aimed at her head should she make it to the general. Her “I have a plan for that” argument for smarter government makes her a modern analog to Mike Dukakis — another Massachusetts charisma machine whose ill-fated presidential run earned him a portrait alongside the Hindenburg in a Naked Gun movie.
<p>
A fourth challenger, Bernie Sanders, is a self-proclaimed socialist born before the Pearl Harbor attack who’s somehow more hated by the national media than Trump. A fifth, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has never earned more than 8,515 votes in any election. The claim to fame of a sixth, Beto O’Rourke, is that he lost a Senate bid to the world’s most-hated Republican. It goes on.
<p>
The top Democrats’ best arguments for office are that they are not each other. Harris is rising in part because she’s not Biden; Warren, because she isn’t Bernie. Bernie’s best argument is the disfavor of the hated Democratic establishment. The Democratic establishment chose Biden because he was the Plan B last time and the party apparently hasn’t come up with anything better since. Nothing says “We’re out of ideas” quite like pulling a pushing-eighty ex-vice president off the bench to lead the most important race in the party’s history.

Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi (&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22matt%20taibbi%22"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;) is one of my favorite political writers, with the style chops of Hunter S Thompson, but without Thompson's often juvenile politics (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/matt.taibbi/posts/10155396934349652"&gt;Taibbi having outgrown that phase&lt;/a&gt;, something Thompson never managed to do).
&lt;span id="more-729467"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Taibbi's latest, a massive on-the-ground report from the Iowa campaigns of the Democratic would-be presidential nominees, is like having a bucket of ice-water dashed over your head by someone who's telling genuinely funny jokes about how terrible it all is, that ha-ha-only-serious mode that is becoming the motif for our era, in the &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2006/09/16/german-antinazi-joke.html"&gt;long tradition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2006/07/12/soviet-joketelling.html"&gt;gallows humor&lt;/a&gt; in dire political circumstances.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like Thompson, Taibbi's on-the-ground reporting from Iowa is marked out not so much by his insights into the candidates, but rather, his expert and nuanced reading of the animal sentiments they arouse in the crowds they address, and in Taibbi's long memory for other political moments in which similar candidates said similar things to &lt;em&gt;exactly the same people&lt;/em&gt; (this being Iowa, which, thanks to a quirk of history, is the hot ticket of American politics).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Taibbi's read on the Democratic leadership race is that it is doubling down on the GOP's "clown car" blunder, which let Trump take nomination from a crowded field of political same-sames who were unable to confront Trump's "Throw the Bums Out" movement because they were the bums that the body politic wanted thrown out. He sees this as an indictment of the Democratic Party, which might be breathing its last gasp, along with America's commitment to democracy itself: "Lose to Donald Trump once, shame on the voters. &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/08/01/democratic-circus.html" class="read-more"&gt;Read the rest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><wfw:commentRss xmlns:wfw="http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/">https://boingboing.net/2019/08/01/democratic-circus.html/feed</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments xmlns:slash="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/">28</slash:comments><post-id xmlns="com-wordpress:feed-additions:1">729467</post-id><feedburner:origLink>https://boingboing.net/2019/08/01/democratic-circus.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The Obamas split, the Queen’s bag of blood, and, oh yes, WWIII is coming, in this week’s dubious tabloids.</title><link>http://feeds.boingboing.net/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/fGQH6VXDnEI/the-obamas-split-the-queen.html</link><category>Post</category><category>tabloids</category><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Peter Sheridan</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 06:35:23 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://boingboing.net/?p=729463</guid><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>After ‘Globe' readers get the scoop on Honey Boo Boo riding an electric scooter, Goldie Hawn shopping for groceries, and “Fears for Cher After Nose Job,” they’re treated to the apparently less pressing news that Iran, North Korea and Russia have pushed us “to the point of no return for an Earth-scorching World War III.” </p>
<p>And the tabloid’ is right: I’m really worried about Cher’s nose.</p>
<p>WWIII does not even merit the smallest mention on the ‘Globe’ cover, which is dominated by its time-honored sport of Obama-bashing, with the headline: “Michelle & Barack SPLIT!” But it’s only work that’s keeping the couple apart as the former president globe-trots from his base in Washington, D.C., while Michelle has reportedly been at their rented Los Angeles home as she and Barack work on their lucrative deal to produce films and series for Netflix.</p>
<p>The ‘National Enquirer’ has an equally dubious cover story: “Divorce Bombshell! Angelina Gives Brad The Kids!” No, Jolie has not given away her six children. She’s simply away filming, and the kids are with their father. It’s not part of their divorce settlement, or a bombshell. Like the Obamas, it’s just a matter of practicality.</p>
<p>If you crave fact-free speculation it’s hard to improve on the ‘Enquirer’ exclusive: “Jen Aniston Testifying At Honeymoon Death Trial!” No, she isn’t. Producer’s assistant Carmel Musgrove drowned on Aniston’s 2015 honeymoon with now-ex-husband Justin Theroux  -  after the newlyweds had already left Bora Bora, it should be noted. But Aniston isn’t even on a list of witnesses yet, because Musgrove’s parents’ wrongful death lawsuit against producer Joel Silver has not even begun and there is no witness list yet.</p>
<p>Britain’s Royal Family continues to provide endless hours of entertainment for the tabloids, though bizarrely one of this week’s stories somehow slipped through the cracks in editorial control and happens to be true.</p>
<p>“Queen Always Travels With Bag of Blood,” reports the ‘Globe.' No, it’s not a reference to Prince Philip. It’s a real bag of blood  -  blue blood, one assumes  -    that accompanies Her Majesty on travels to countries that President Trump might brand “shitholes,” or which in British parlance are nations where a ready supply of safe blood for transfusions is not readily assured.</p>
<p>Less convincing is the ‘Enquirer’ story “Duchess in Distress! Pressures of Royal Life Push Meghan to Breaking Point.” The Duchess of Sussex is evidently so distressed that she merits a meagre six short paragraphs claiming that she has “struggled with adjusting to British high society.” Perhaps she’d feel less stressed if she carried a spare bag of blood around with her?</p>
<p>The typically trash-talking tabloids inexplicably go ga-ga over newly released photos of Prince William and Kate’s infant son Prince George. </p>
<p>“By George, He’s Cute!” raves the ‘Globe,' perhaps setting him up for a coming pre-school kiss-and-tell from a disgruntled classmate.<br />
“Birthday Boy George Is Queen’s Favorite!” gushes the ‘Enquirer,” which claims that the Queen “knows she doesn’t have much time left. She’s vowed to spend every moment she can with George.” More likely, one imagines that George is the only Royal old enough to talk to the Queen who hasn’t royally pissed her off yet.<br />
‘Us’ magazine brings us one of its typical bait-and-switch exclusives, promising on its cover: “Former Scientologist Tells All! Suri’s Life Without Daddy.”</p>
<p>Alarm bells ring when we learn that the person promising to “tell all” about Scientology poster boy Tom Cruise and his daughter Suri is opera singer Placido Domingo’s ex-daughter-in-law Samantha, who left the cult in 2004  -  two years before Suri was born.</p>
<p>How much of this four-page “tell all” is devoted to Suri? Four short sentences. A total of 109 words. Now that’s a great tell-all.<br />
And what does Domingo tell about Suri’s life without Cruise? She speculates that their last public sighting together in 2013 was “maybe” just a “photo-op,” and repeats a well-worn claim about Scientology belief that “Suri’s not really his daughter  -  she’s just a spiritual being in his daughter’s body.” </p>
<p>The rest of the four-page spread is packed with ancient allegations: Nicole Kidman was branded a “suppressive person” by the Church and ostracized, Jada Pinkett Smith may have been a Church recruiter, and Juliette Lewis tried to recruit then-boyfriend Brad Pitt, and former cult devotee Leah Remini is  -  shock, horror  -  “dead serious when it comes to taking down Scientology."</p>
<p>‘People’ magazine somehow missed the scoop on WWIII, and instead devotes its cover to a story of far greater global importance.<br />
“Bachelorette Betrayed!” screams its headline about reality TV’s Hannah Brown. “I Won’t Marry a Liar.” You have to admire a woman who sticks to her principles and breaks off her engagement to the show’s winning suitor after discovering that he had not told her about a girlfriend he was dating before he began filming ‘The Bachelorette.’ </p>
<p>Would it be churlish to point out that this righteous indignation comes from a woman who confessed to sleeping with another contestant four times while romancing her fiancé during filming of the show?</p>
<p>Fortunately we have the crack investigative team at ‘Us’ mag to tell us that Anne Hathaway wore it best, that actress Tia Mowry admits “I burp a lot,” that Jamie-Lynn Sigler’s five-year-old son Beau carries chickpea pasta, grated Parmesan cheese and gummies in his Pottery Barn Kids shark lunch box (I kid you not. Perhaps they’ve simply run out of celebrities willing to open their purses to ridicule), and that the stars are just like us: they shop for groceries (there’s Goldie Hawn again!) pick up dry cleaning, and stay hydrated.</p>
<p>For those millions worldwide terrified that Cher’s plastic surgery will “destroy her looks and her career,” a cosmetic surgeon who has not treated the singer-actress claims that her nose has been irrevocably changed: the “tip is smaller and rotated upwards.”</p>
<p>Oh, the humanity. If that’s not reason enough to start WWIII, I don’t know what is.</p>
<p>Onwards and downwards . . . </p>
