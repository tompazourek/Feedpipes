        <![CDATA[<p>Vic Putz continues to carry a torch for the SpaceOrb, as do I, except he's actually doing something about it. Vic has been working on a new version called the Orbotron 9001 for the last few years that is an interface for the SpaceOrb to modern systems. Scott talks to Vic about their shared love of this 25 year old controller and why the world is missing out on the magic of 6 degrees of freedom.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Vic Putz continues to carry a torch for the SpaceOrb, as do I, except he's actually doing something about it. Vic has been working on a new version called the Orbotron 9001 for the last few years that is an interface for the SpaceOrb to modern systems. Scott talks to Vic about their shared love of this 25 year old controller and why the world is missing out on the magic of 6 degrees of freedom.</p>

      <title>Performance as a Feature with Jeremy Boyd</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Raygun promises to give a window into how users are really experiencing your software applications with diagnostics and error logging and more. What's really interesting however, is how they scaled to billions of events. In moving to .NET Core from Node they increased throughput by 2000 percent. How do you build systems that scale to these heights while still dealing with Moore's Law? How do you load test a system this big? What does it mean to &quot;monitor what matters&quot;? Is .NET Core ready for production? All this plus perf as a feature on this episode.</p>

You can play a decade old game - originally meant for 640x480 or 720p resolution - and enjoy it in 4k resolution. Not upscaled. Actually up to 10x clearer within recompiling the game? How?

      <title>Investing in Underrepresented Tech Founders with Arlan Hamilton's Backstage Capital </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We talked to Arlan Hamilton two years ago (almost to the day) as she was starting her Venture Fund for underrepresented founders. What's changed since then? Arlan Hamilton's Backstage Capital has invested more than $4M+ in over 80 companies led by underrepresented founders. How has she gone from Homeless to VC in just a few years? Arlan also recently started Project Cover to give micro-grants to driven creatives. Scott catches up with Arlan to hear about how she's continued to build her team and her fund and BUILD COOL STUFF. And also - what's the right way to eat string cheese?</p>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We all remember when we first saw Etherpad or Google Docs and could type in an online document while another remote person typed in the same doc. It's magic! Fast forward and soon we can share entire code workspaces and debugging sessions using languages and frameworks that aren't even installed on our machines?

      <title>Creativity, Code, Community, and Connected Objects with Dawn C. Hayes</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Scott talks with coder, tinkerer, and occasional adjunct professor Dawn C Hayes about the intersection of physical computing and creating coding. As we write code more, we have to ask ourselves &quot;but are we improving our world? The community? Our culture?&quot; The advent of wearables, augmented games, and networked objects has the potential to take computing out of the garage and into the collective consciousness. Dawn teaches Scott about how these objects can combine with new thinking around informal learning to engage not only new audiences but the next generation of creator.</p>
