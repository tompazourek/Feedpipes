Fifty years ago, the Saturn V blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center and landed the first men on the moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the surface, while Michael Collins stayed in Lunar orbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exalted event stands as one of our most triumphant accomplishments. The many scientists, engineers, astronauts and creative people that it would go on to inspire is countless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We owe an innumerable cultural debt to this technological era. Which is why on the eve of Apollo 11's 50th anniversary, &lt;a href="https://theharrispoll.com/lego-group-kicks-off-global-program-to-inspire-the-next-generation-of-space-explorers-as-nasa-celebrates-50-years-of-moon-landing/" target="_blank"&gt;LEGO and The Harris Poll set out to survey children &lt;/a&gt;in the United States, China, and the United Kingdom on their attitude and knowledge concerning space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 3,000 children were surveyed. While the results revealed that there was some lingering excitement for space, there were some disconcerting trends as well. Such as the fact that American kids would rather aspire to inanity on YouTube as a "vlogger" than to the great beyond as an astronaut in space.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results of the survey&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="LY8FT91564693533" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="41d01" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDUxNjA3Mi85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjUwODA2OTN9.Xm1qZNbgyyisrKa6YRlE-G9wueBH7_v7FKb6it8DqJE/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, children were three times as likely to aspire towards a YouTube career than an astronaut. That is, creating videos on the internet in order to become famous. Kids in the study were between the ages of 8 and 12. On average only 11 percent said they wanted to be an astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only place this trend was reversed was in China. A majority of children in China, at 56 percent, would rather be an astronaut over other professions. Their other answers to space questions showed that Chinese children were also more interested in the prospect of not only going to space, but creating settlements there as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three out of four children, in general, believed that humans would eventually live in space or on another planet. About 96 percent of Chinese children prescribed to this answer, compared to 68 percent in the United States and 63 percent in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of whether they'd like to go to space, 95 percent of Chinese children said yes, compared to 70 percent from the U.S. and 63 percent from the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey didn't delve into why children in the West were less interested in space than their Chinese counterparts. We can only begin to speculate. Perhaps it's the fact that we've been in a rut since the 1970s and haven't set foot on another celestial body since then. It could be a lapse in good space PR combined with apathy spurred from our continual failings to rile up enough support for another grand initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China currently places a greater emphasis on long-term goals, as well as a higher value on the tangible applications of space exploration. They're both educated and united under the primal banner of human curiosity and a nationalistic organizational efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also comes down to just plain ignorance. Western kids are barraged at a young age with frivolous "internet stars," whose only claim to fame is commercialized parroting. This is a great waste of intellectual capital as children seek to emulate these people. The survey also found that kids truly don't understand the impact and importance that space travel has imparted to their daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, only 18 percent of Western children knew they used something that was invented because of space travel, compared to 43 percent in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many things in life, knowledge and inspiration can help reverse these concerning trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Inspiring kids for space exploration &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bettina Inclán, NASA associate administrator for communications, is optimistic about what to do next to inspire future generations of America:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"For nearly 20 years, NASA and LEGO Group have collaborated on projects to inspire the next generation to imagine and build their future in space. Our latest efforts celebrate the incredible feats we achieved during Apollo 50 years ago, and now with our accelerated plans to go forward to the moon, we will continue to inspire children to dream about what's possible and to grow up to pursue STEM careers." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be inspired about. The future of humanity lies beyond the atmosphere. If we're going to travel there and stay there, we'll need our best and brightest to &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/inventions-space-colonization" target="_self"&gt;invent some incredible new technology. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we're going to make space exploration possible, we first have to pass down our dreams to the future custodians of the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/giTWIQoqp5o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:40:41 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/vloggers-astronauts</guid><category>Space</category><category>Space travel</category><category>United states</category><category>Youtube</category><category>Internet</category><dc:creator>Mike Colagrossi</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20516767/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/vloggers-astronauts</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Teen wins Google Science Fair for method to remove microplastics from water</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/OfFT3hIKZiY/microplastics-google-science</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20516131/origin.png"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google holds an annual science fair that's open to students ages 13 to 18.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fionn Ferreira won for developing an effective way to remove microplastics from water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microplastics can be found in many habitats around the world, posing a threat to marine life and, therefore, people who eat fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Irish teenager has won the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/07/30/irish-teen-wins-2019-google-science-fair-for-removing-microplastics-from-water/#313ca44c373f" target="_blank"&gt;2019 Google Science Fair&lt;/a&gt; for developing a method to remove microplastics from water. The idea came to 18-year-old Fionn Ferreira when he was kayaking and spotted a rock covered in bits of tiny plastic near his home in West Cork, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"It got me thinking," Ferreira told &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microplastics-water-pollution-solution-from-google-2019-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; "In chemistry, like attracts like."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for his project, Ferreira added oil and magnetite powder to water containing microplastics, defined as plastic bits 5 millimeters or smaller. (Magnetite is a naturally occurring, non-toxic iron oxide.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This created a ferrofluid that combined with the microplastics, which are non-polar and "find it easier to go into suspension with the oil than remain suspended in the water," Ferreira &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DbF1oV-NG86RZ9bRTNXVDLH7_QZcKFf/view" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. Because ferrofluids are magnetized, Ferreira was able to use a magnet to extract the oil-magnetite-microplastics combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests showed that this extraction method removed an average of about 87 percent of microplastics from water. The method removed some microplastics more effectively than others, with washing-machine fibers as the easiest to remove, and polypropylene the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferreira hopes to scale his method for use at wastewater treatment facilities, where it would hopefully remove microplastics from wastewater before it makes its way to the oceans. Ferreira will receive $50,000 and STEM-related educational opportunities for winning the science fair, which Google has held annually since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="KS8CRU1564689932" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJUOjBhJe1E?rel=0?enablejsapi=1" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics now pollute virtually all the world's ecosystems, posing a threat to marine life and, therefore, the &lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/youre-eating-microplastics-in-ways-you-dont-even-realise-97649" target="_blank"&gt;humans who eat fish&lt;/a&gt;. In March, researchers at Bangor University described finding microplastics in every lake, river and reservoir they examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was startling. I wasn't expecting to find as much as we did," Christian Dunn at Bangor University, Wales, who led the work, told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/07/microplastic-pollution-revealed-absolutely-everywhere-by-new-research" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "It is quite depressing they were there in some of our country's most iconic locations. I'm sure Wordsworth would not be happy to discover his beloved Ullswater in the Lake District was polluted with plastic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics exist not only in shallow waters and on the ocean surface in giant garbage patches, but also in seemingly large quantities in the &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-deep-ocean-harbors-a-mountain-of-microplastic-pollution/" target="_blank"&gt;deep ocean&lt;/a&gt;. So, while trapping microplastics at wastewater treatment facilities or &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/stephen-johnson/great-pacific-garbage-patch-the-ocean-cleanup-project-set-to-launch-full-scale-test-in-september" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;corralling plastic and garbage with massive nets&lt;/a&gt; might slow pollution, Ferreira has a bigger strategy in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not saying that my project is the solution," he told &lt;em&gt;Business Insider.&lt;/em&gt; "The solution is that we stop using plastic altogether."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/OfFT3hIKZiY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:21:28 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/microplastics-google-science</guid><category>Oceans</category><category>Innovation</category><category>Environment</category><category>Pollution</category><dc:creator>Stephen  Johnson</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20516131/980x.png" medium="image" type="image/png" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/microplastics-google-science</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>College education is still a class luxury in America.

Then, the researchers will bring the embryos to term in surrogate animals. The cells that come from humans are known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), which are derived from skin or blood cells and reprogrammed to revert to an embryonic-like state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals would, if successful, use these stem cells to produce a pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are trying to do targeted organ generation, so the cells go only to the pancreas," Nakauchi told &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02275-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Japan overturned a ban on growing human cells inside animal embryos for more than 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Finally, we are in a position to start serious studies in this field after 10 years of preparation," Nakauchi &lt;a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201907250051.html" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Asahi Shimbun&lt;/em&gt;. "We don't expect to create human organs immediately, but this allows us to advance our research based upon the know-how we have gained up to this point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some bioethicists are concerned that introducing human cells into other species' embryos could cause problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is problematic, both ethically and from a safety aspect, to place human iPS cells, which are still capable of transforming into all types of cells, into the fertilized eggs of rats and mice," Jiro Nudeshima, a researcher who specializes in the ethical implications of life science research, told &lt;em&gt;The Asahi Shimbun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;An "Uncomfortable and Unstable" Situation for Stem Cell Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nakauchi downplayed these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The number of human cells grown in the bodies of sheep is extremely small, like one in thousands or one in tens of thousands," he told &lt;em&gt;The Asahi Shimbun&lt;/em&gt;. "At that level, an animal with a human face will never be born."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers plan to terminate any experiment if they ever detect that more than 30 percent of the rodent brains are human, per the government's guidelines. The current experiments are designed to test the limits of growing human cells inside animal embryos. Nakauchi hopes to eventually conduct similar experiments involving pigs, but that will require additional government approval, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing the amount of donatable organs could save thousands of lives around the world. In the U.S., for example, approximately 113,000 people were on waiting lists for organ donations in January 2019, and as many as 20 people die each day while waiting for a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/agB1T8xkSF8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 19:49:24 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/animal-human-embryo</guid><category>Medical research</category><category>Animals</category><category>Bioethics</category><category>Dna</category><category>Human body</category><dc:creator>Stephen  Johnson</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20511770/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/animal-human-embryo</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>What does Slavoj Žižek mean when he talks about ideology?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/iu4rjZ8QAqU/slavoj-zizek-ideology</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20511096/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Žižek is often a profound thinker, but he can be difficult to understand. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His ideas about ideology are well known, but not often understood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fact that his best explanation of the idea involves a John Carpenter movie is the most Slavoj Žižek thing ever. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slavoj Žižek is one of the most famous philosophers in the world. Known for his mannerisms, frequent use of film references, and love of a shocking &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/slavoj-zizek-jordan-peterson-debate" target="_self"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, he has been interviewed, parodied, and discussed for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most people only know him for his occasional stunts and fun interviews. His actual thought often eludes people. This is a shame since it is often insightful and profound. Today, we'll look at what he means when he turns to his favorite topic, ideology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is ideology?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people hear the word "ideology," they think of a large set of socio-political beliefs that typically end in "ism;" communism, liberalism, conservatism, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Žižek uses the term "&lt;a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/#He" target="_blank"&gt;ideology&lt;/a&gt;," he is using it in a Marxist sense. For &lt;a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/THEORY/marxism/modules/marxideology.html" target="_blank"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt;, ideology is a series of discourses that push false ideas on people. When people buy into these false ideas, they develop a "false consciousness" about the world, how it works, and their place in it. According to Marx, without ideology, no society could function for very long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, in Medieval Europe, religion was used as an ideology to support the structure of society. Serfs were told that the people in charge were put there by God and that the way the world worked was the only divinely ordained way it could work. No wonder people who were essentially slaves didn't rise up; they were told God wanted them at the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Marx, other ideologies like capitalism or liberalism work the same way. They are created, work to help sustain a particular social structure, and ultimately fall out of favor when a new idea comes to force. When this happens, the whole structure of society can change in a hurry as a new ideology fills the void. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Žižek, himself essentially a Marxist, starts with this idea and goes further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking off on the development of the idea of ideology done by &lt;a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/THEORY/marxism/modules/althusserideology.html" target="_blank"&gt;Louis Althusser&lt;/a&gt;, Žižek incorporates psychology into ideology. While for Marx, ideology is a conscious exercise, Žižek suggests that ideology is also a subconscious phenomenon that helps to shape the world we live in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Woah, slow
down. What?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://content.jwplatform.com/players/4KTAgoIp-FvQKszTI.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is a little more confusing, so bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Žižek is building off Althusser, who fused the idea of ideology with the psychology of Jacques Lacan. According to Lacan, we don't interact with the world as it is, but rather as we represent it through language. Because of this disconnect, ideology moves down from being about the world as it is to being about how we view the world to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In technical terms used by Dino Felluga at Purdue:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"Ideology does not 'reflect' the real world but 'represents' the 'imaginary relationship of individuals' to the real world; the thing ideology (mis)represents is itself already at one remove [sic] from the real. … .In other words, we are always within ideology because of our reliance on language to establish our 'reality'; different ideologies are but different representations of our social and imaginary 'reality.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this understanding, ideology takes on a new role. It no longer merely hides how the world works from people but helps to shape how they view and talk about it in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help understand this, have a joke that Žižek likes to tell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"A man comes into a restaurant. He sits down at the table and he says, 'Waiter, bring me a cup of coffee without cream.' Five minutes later, the waiter comes back and says, 'I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream. Can it be without milk?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This joke, from the movie Ninotchka, shows how the same object, black coffee, can be changed by how we think about it. While physically the coffee is the same, we conceptualize coffee without milk and coffee without cream as two different things. Ideology, which influences how we subconsciously view the world, is one of the factors that determines if we see our black coffee as lacking cream or milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of thinking can be applied to &lt;em&gt;everything, &lt;/em&gt;not just coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial for Žižek is his argument that we are all influenced by the prevailing ideology even if we think we aren't. In the same way that we may think we are looking at the world as it really is when we think of all black coffee as "coffee without milk," ideology can cause us to look at things in a very subjective way while also telling us we are entirely objective about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some thinkers, like Richard Rorty or Tony Blair, have suggested we're are in a post-ideological age, Žižek argues that the appearance of such a thing is evidence that the dominant ideologies have finally "come into their own." That is, they are so entrenched that people are no longer able to see them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conceptualize this, we'll use another one of Žižek's favorite examples; think of how many people sincerely believe there is no alternative to modern liberal capitalism. Not just full-blown laissez-faire types, but those who think that the only possible changes to the system are minor tweaks like a higher minimum wage or different tax rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Žižek argues that this very line of thinking is an example of ideology in action. It isn't that there aren't alternatives to our current model of capitalism — there are — it's that people are so taken in by capitalist ideology that they cannot even fathom an alternative way of organizing a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism:_Is_There_No_Alternative%3F" target="_blank"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;. The brilliance of it is that they don't think they're being taken in by anything; they'll tell you they're neutral and objective the entire time! This mechanism makes ideologies self-sustaining and so difficult to critique or escape from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How
seriously should I take this notion of ideology?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps obviously, these ideas, from Marx's starting point all the way down to Žižek's stance, are controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noam Chomsky, who has had a bit of a spat with Žižek in the past, held Lacan to be a "charlatan" and you can imagine what he thinks of a theory that relies heavily on his psychoanalytic theories to &lt;a href="http://www.critical-theory.com/noam-chomsky-calls-jacques-lacan-a-charlatan/" target="_blank"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;. Žižek's work, in general, is often accused of being muddled, unclear, and occasionally mistaken when he tries to take ideas from other fields into philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zizek also uses the idea of ideology to express other notions he has about psychology, society, and government that even more controversial, but we won't get into them here. So, don't take this idea of ideology as gospel just yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the idea that we make certain assumptions about the world around us or about what is "natural" or "obvious" and that the prevailing ideology around us often influences these assumptions isn't too bold a claim. After all, most intelligent people would admit to thinking about things the way they do, at least in part, because of where they're from and how they were raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can I
use this idea in my life?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="40DJT21564610733" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVwKjGbz60k?rel=0?enablejsapi=1" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his entertaining film &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2152198/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;The Pervert's Guide to Ideology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Žižek relates the idea of ideology to the glasses in the movie &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;They Live&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by John Carpenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who haven't seen it, the film is about a man who realizes that the world is controlled by aliens who use subliminal messages to influence the human race. It is only by the use of special glasses that he can see through the illusions and understand the world as it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds weird, but it's a good film. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Žižek, while spliced into &lt;em&gt;They Live&lt;/em&gt;, explains that ideology is much like the glasses in the film — only backwards. We are all wearing glasses all the time that prevent us from seeing the world as it is and show us the world through the lens of ideology. Most people don't understand this and will strongly object to this notion. The trick is to try to get the glasses off, or at least to know how they change your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the most immediate use of this idea might be the simplest. Remember that you're probably not as objective as you think and that things that you think are obvious, common sense, and far beyond political discussion may be none of those things. Žižek wants you to question everything about society, especially when something seems to be so obvious it shouldn't be questioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/iu4rjZ8QAqU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:50:09 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/slavoj-zizek-ideology</guid><category>Society</category><category>Psychology</category><category>Philosophy</category><category>Language</category><dc:creator>Scotty Hendricks</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20511096/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/slavoj-zizek-ideology</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Mysterious radiation leak, 100x larger than Fukushima disaster, traced to Russian facility</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/o2vqxeJgjdA/radiation-leak-russia</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20510726/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The nuclear leak occurred in 2017 and was recorded by scientists in multiple European countries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No nation or organization has ever claimed responsibility for the leak, which, while massive, is not believed to have harmed anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new study used more than 1,300 measurements to trace the likely source of the leak to the Urals region of Russia, where lies the Mayak nuclear complex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2017, a massive cloud of nuclear radiation floated over Europe, releasing into the atmosphere between 30 and 100 times more radiation than that of the &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/13294-timeline-events-japan-fukushima-nuclear-reactors.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fukushima accident in Japan in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. The source of the leak has remained a mystery, as no nation or organization has yet claimed responsibility. Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/07/25/1907571116" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; claims to have traced the source of the leak to the Mayak nuclear facility in southern Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nuclear leak was first recorded on October 2, 2017, when a team of Italian scientists recorded unusually high levels of a radioactive isotope called ruthenium-106 over Milan. Hours later, scientists in the Czech Republic, Austria, Norway, and, soon after, five other countries issued alerts after detecting high levels of ruthenium-106. It soon became clear that a nuclear accident had occurred somewhere in Eurasia — analyses of the ruthenium-106 suggested it was released "at an advanced stage in the reprocessing of nuclear fuel," says the new study. This claim was supported by the fact that ruthenium-106 was the only radioactive substance recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the radiation wasn't dangerous to humans. The Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety wrote in 2017 that the "concentration levels of ruthenium-106 in the air that have been recorded in Europe and especially in France are of no consequence for human health and for the environment," but it added that conditions could be dangerous close to the accident site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question was: where's that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on weather patterns, an early culprit was Russia's Mayak nuclear complex, the site of the notorious 1957 Kyshtym nuclear disaster. But Russian officials denied an accident at Mayak, suggesting instead that the radiation came from a satellite whose radionuclide battery had burned up upon reentering the atmosphere. This "satellite hypothesis" fell flat after no space organization reported losing any satellites. The source of the leak was never determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study — published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences — aims to close the case. Using more than 1,300 measurements from 176 measuring stations in 29 countries, scientists traced the source of the accident to the southern Urals region of Russia, where lies the Mayak nuclear complex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to detection time series, a back-trajectory analysis, and chemical considerations, the Mayak nuclear complex in southern Urals should be considered as a likely candidate for the release," the study concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="3VJR2L1564689946" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b41fd" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDUxMDYyNC85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjQ5MjAyNjl9.6NpUMwABx-BOb8Xg1fR5zodrziK0htm37m-J872EPpc/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also notes how European countries have established a monitoring network designed to detect radionuclides, due in part to concerns resulting from the &lt;a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/washington-wine" target="_blank"&gt;1986 Chernobyl disaster.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today most of these European networks are connected to each other via the informal 'Ring of Five' (Ro5) platform for the purpose of rapid exchange of expert information on a laboratory level about airborne radionuclides detected at trace levels," it says. "In October 2017, an unprecedented release of ruthenium-106 into the atmosphere was the subject of numerous detections and exchanges within the Ro5."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned Russian nuclear corporation Rosatom denied the findings of the recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We maintain that there have been no reportable events at any Rosatom-operated plants or facilities," Rosatom said. "Both the national regulator and experts from an independent international inquiry inspected the Mayak facility back in 2017 and found nothing to suggest that the ruthenium-106 isotope originated from this site, nor found any traces of an alleged accident, nor found any evidence of local staff exposure to elevated levels of radioactivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/o2vqxeJgjdA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 15:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/radiation-leak-russia</guid><category>Europe</category><category>Public health</category><category>Energy</category><category>Nuclear energy</category><dc:creator>Stephen  Johnson</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20510726/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/radiation-leak-russia</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Quantum Darwinism, which may explain our reality, passes tests</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/R5PalwbJVrw/quantum-mechanics-which-may-explain-our-reality-passes-tests</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20510126/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quantum Darwinism, a theory created by &lt;a href="https://public.lanl.gov/whz/" target="_blank"&gt;Wojciech Zurek&lt;/a&gt;, may explain decoherence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The theory looks to reconcile quantum mechanics with classical physics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three recent studies support the theory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics is always good for a head-scratching idea – in part, due to its seeming incompatibility with classical physics. One of the major conundrums it offers is the concept of &lt;strong&gt;superposition&lt;/strong&gt; – the ability of a particle to exist in a range of possible states. That certainly doesn't gel with our everyday experience. We appear to be living in one consistent reality where the objects we can observe aren't fluctuating in and out of existence. The reason why might lie in &lt;strong&gt;Quantum Darwinism,&lt;/strong&gt; a theory bolstered by a trio of recent experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unification of classical and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank"&gt;quantum mechanics &lt;/a&gt;has been the holy grail of physics. Quantum Darwinism, a theory first proposed in 2003 by the Polish theoretical physicist &lt;a href="https://public.lanl.gov/whz/" target="_blank"&gt;Wojciech Zurek&lt;/a&gt; of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, looks to reconcile the two by explaining the process of &lt;strong&gt;decoherence&lt;/strong&gt; – the way a quantum system turns to a classical state. Zurek's theory proposes that it's how the system is interacting with its environment that causes decoherence, rather than the observation of it. The ubiquity of environmental influences is why we don't see big objects like ourselves or the moon, for instance, being in quantum states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zurek says that quantum systems exhibit &lt;strong&gt;"pointer states"&lt;/strong&gt; – characteristics like a particle's location or speed that can be measured. During interactions with the environment around it, a particle's superpositions (like alternative speeds or locations) decohere, with only the pointer state remanning. That is the state people can observe as it "imprints" its replica on the environment. According to Zurek, only the "fittest" state that is best adapted for the environment will come out of decoherence. Hence, the connection to Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview with &lt;a href="https://public.lanl.gov/whz/images/qd.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The Foundational Questions Institute in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, Zurek elaborated on his thinking, saying "The main idea of quantum Darwinism is that we almost never do any direct measurement on anything." He added that "[The environment] is like a big advertising billboard, which floats multiple copies of the information about our universe all over the place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;"Quantum Darwinism" explained by Dr. Wojciech Zurek&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ACM7UJ1564677312" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/27zMdaBgt6g?rel=0?enablejsapi=1" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're still following this mind-twister of an idea, you'd be happy to know that there have been recent experiments carried out that tested Quantum Darwinism, &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/" target="_blank"&gt;as reported by Quanta Magazine.&lt;/a&gt; Three separate groups of researchers from &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.98.020101" target="_blank"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07388" target="_blank"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and Germany looked for signs of imprints left by a quantum system on the environment. Two experiments involved sending laser photons thru optical devices, while the third exploited the nitrogen-vacancy defect.

If not as apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have replaced the hearth with electric ovens and central heating, but the burning of fossil fuels accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" target="_blank"&gt;63.5 percent of U.S. electricity generation&lt;/a&gt;. We still heat our homes and cook our food with fire — just in a more roundabout manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We even use fire in ways our ancestors couldn't have imagined. The internal combustion engine has replaced animals and our own wobbly legs as the preferred method of travel. We can go farther in a day than the vast majority of our ancestors did in a lifetime and even escape the confines of our planet. Thanks to fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fire has done more than create the energy that makes our lives comfortable. By one Harvard professor's account, fire altered the course of our evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fire, a brief history&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="PWJ1X01564691553" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="4dfb9" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDUwNjgwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NTIyMTM2MH0.JcCXcSPGD8A_jMO6QOKsuXo6ZJ4eH2rKYzgRpEW-qd4/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=244%2C0%2C244%2C0&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, some Chem 101. Fire requires three elements for its reaction: oxygen, a fuel, and a heat source. Since two of the three elements are provided naturally by plants, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/59/7/593/334816" target="_blank"&gt;the history of fire&lt;/a&gt; became intricately tied to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of our earliest evidence for fire goes back 440 million years to the &lt;a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/silurian/silurian.php" target="_blank"&gt;Silurian period&lt;/a&gt;, when Earth's climate stabilized and plants and animals began to move to land. Of note, this period provides the earliest fossil evidence of vascular plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this point, fire becomes a recurrent phenomenon with times of high and low activity based on environmental conditions. During the &lt;a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/carboniferous/carboniferous.php" target="_blank"&gt;Carboniferous period&lt;/a&gt;, atmospheric oxygen hit a record high of 31 percent and plants spread across the supercontinent Pangea, so charcoal records suggest a lot of fire activity during this period. Conversely, the pittance of charcoal from the Triassic period suggests low atmospheric oxygen and fewer plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumping a few million years to the late Miocene, hominins moved to the grasslands and begun to further diverge from their ape relatives — likely due to the difference between the African savanna and the dense jungle. Here, they would have also encountered wildfires with far more regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We didn't start the fire&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="9S5ZBK1564691553" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="af2c4" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDUwNzA2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NTE3MzUxNn0.u_Wr87d8jZHNvHFWgdLROZbuYuizrfO7XZrAvlyQszk/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C428&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-hanging references aside, &lt;a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTLKWw542g" target="_blank"&gt;Billy Joel&lt;/a&gt; was on to something. Popular culture conjures the image of a caveman banging two stones together. Sparks fly, and then the eureka moment. Yet, our ancestors' first usage of fire probably wasn't a matter of control or invention. It was more likely opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2015.0164" target="_blank"&gt;a review for the &lt;em&gt;Royal Society Philosophical Transactions B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~gowlett/" target="_blank"&gt;J.A.J. Gowlett&lt;/a&gt; hypothesizes that hominins took advantage of natural wildfires for foraging. "For hominins," he writes, "benefits could include retrieval of birds eggs, rodents, lizards and other small animals, as well as invertebrates. Although fire does not create such resources, it renders them far more visible, and chance cooking might well improve their digestibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gowlett notes that analogues to this behavior exist in the natural world today. Savanna chimpanzees use fires to locate resources, and several bird species follow fires to snatch up any prey flushed out by the smoke and flames. There has even been anecdotal evidence of some raptors, such as Australia's "&lt;a href="https://wildlife.org/australian-firehawks-use-fire-to-catch-prey/" target="_blank"&gt;firehawks&lt;/a&gt;," picking up smoldering wood from one fire and carrying it elsewhere to start another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early hominins would have also begun to discover fire's properties by observing and interacting with these blazes. For example, if a meaty morsel proved too raw, they may have learned to place it on embers to continue the cooking process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given our early reliance on nature for fire, it's little wonder that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft_of_fire" target="_blank"&gt;theft of fire &lt;/a&gt; theme has appeared time and again in the world's mythologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But we kept it burning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="QCZT3F1564691553" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="0975f" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDUwNzA5NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NDgzMjY3OH0.ojNxvOypDiIF50AEW6Sj1shWupnmSuZ8TdyU6mARMiw/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C187%2C0%2C187&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to follow the development of hominin control over fire because of what Gowlett calls its "disappearing act." Fire isn't as well preserved in the archeological record as, say, middens or flint tools. And progress was incremental, with fire control being learned in different places at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain archeological sites have proffered a bounty of stone tools, suggesting long-term quartering. Such occupancy could mean hominins learned to at least maintain fire as far back as 2.5 million years ago. But direct evidence is scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we move forward, we see more evidence of hominins' control over fire. Archaeologists have discovered campfire traces and charred animal and plant remains at &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/news/human-ancestors-tamed-fire-earlier-than-thought" target="_blank"&gt;Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. These have been dated back to approximately one million years ago. And the oldest known hearth, found at Qesem Cave, Israel, dates back more than 300,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, archeologists aren't sure which hominin species got cozy at Qesem. "It is clearly different than&lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-erectus" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;[Homo] erectus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and has affinities of both&lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-sapiens" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;[Homo] sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/homo-neanderthalensis" target="_blank"&gt; Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;," Ran Barkai, Tel Aviv archaeologist, &lt;a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140129-oldest-hearth-israel-cave-new-human-species-discovery-archaeology-science/" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Since Neanderthals appear very late in the Levant and are of European origin, and since the Qesem teeth bear more resemblance to early &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; in the Levant, we believe they are closer to &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearths and campfires tell us hominins could maintain fires for cooking and warmth. They do not, however, prove our ability to create fire. After transferring a brand from a wildfire, a tribe member could have been given fire duty and tasked with fueling the fire to prevent its extinguishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evidence for fire creation appears around 120,000 years ago, when hominins had access to twine, a requisite to developing the bow drill. And archeologists have dated two glues used in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;hafting&lt;/a&gt;, bark pitch and gypsum plaster, to between 50 and 100 thousand years ago. Neither of these can be prepared without fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Gowlett argues, the invention of fire belongs to our ancestors. "[A]n understanding is emerging that fire use is not a single technology or process, but that several scales of use, and probably several intensifying technologies, evolved over a long period, intertwined, and sometimes eventually became bound together," he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fire (and food) for thought&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did fire make us human? It allowed us to cook our food. That's according to &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cooking-up-bigger-brains/" target="_blank"&gt;the cooking hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; proposed by &lt;a href="https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/richard-w-wrangham" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Wrangham&lt;/a&gt;, Ruth B. Moore Professor of Biological Anthropology at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230980-600-what-was-the-first-cooked-meal/" target="_blank"&gt;Cooked meats&lt;/a&gt; are easier to chew and digest; as a result, our bodies can extract more nutrients from the same amount of meat. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/raw-veggies-are-healthier/" target="_blank"&gt;cooking vegetables&lt;/a&gt; increases levels of healthy stuff like antioxidants. That's because the cooking process breaks down the plants' cell walls and, like meat, makes them easier to digest and process. (Though, it is a tradeoff. Some veggies are healthier raw, and it depends on how you cook them.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrangham argues that the ability to create cooked foods shaped the brains and bodies of our &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; ancestors. Since our ancestors spent less energy digesting foods and could draw out additional nutrients, they had more to nutrients to spend, and evolution spent those dividends on maintaining larger brains — not to mention smaller teeth and jaws. &lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/brains" target="_blank"&gt;Larger brains&lt;/a&gt; allowed us to process more information, create more dynamic social groups, and adjust to unfamiliar habitats. All of which benefited us evolutionarily.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, the cooking hypothesis has its detractors. Some argue there is little proof that humans were cooking or maintaining fire in concurrence with &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus' &lt;/em&gt;brain-size explosion (roughly 1.5 million years ago). It's also possible that a diet of raw meat and veggies could have provided the necessary nutrients for bigger brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hypotheses exist to explain the increase in hominin brain size. &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/humans-evolved-big-brains-to-be-social-122425811/" target="_blank"&gt;The social brain hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, for example, argues our brains evolved to meet the challenges of living in large social groups. But even here, fire plays a role. Remember that before our ancestors could ignite fire, they had to maintain it. This required a division of labor, which is only possible in a species with a highly structured social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fire may or may not ultimately prove to be principal in our evolutionary development. For any such hypothesis more evidence is needed — though fire, cooked food, and social networks likely all played a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, fire has proved a primary mover in the evolution of civilization. It helped us migrate to climates that would otherwise prove inhospitable. It was essential to the development of cuisine, agriculture, metallurgy, architecture, and a host of other industries. In short, the invention of fire has taken humanity places no other species has gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/yCUT7rtEY_I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:13:34 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/inventions-fire</guid><category>Technology</category><category>Innovation</category><category>Discovery</category><category>Anthropocene</category><category>Nature</category><category>Plants</category><category>Energy</category><category>Invention</category><dc:creator>Kevin Dickinson</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20507088/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/inventions-fire</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>What do we lose when we can't get lost?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/JOtCr_vMzeo/maura-oconnor-wayfinding</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20347496/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Science writer Maura O'Connor spent four years traveling the world to better understand how humans navigate their terrain. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;She writes "getting lost is a uniquely human problem," noting that other species don't have issues navigating. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the book is not anti-technology, O'Connor questions our reliance on GPS and self-driving cars. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent episode of &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/3-werner-herzog/id1469999563?i=1000445326690" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Portal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, filmmaker Werner Herzog says "the world reveals itself to those who travel on foot." Author Rebecca Solnit dedicated an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wanderlust-History-Walking-Rebecca-Solnit/dp/0140286012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;entire book to walking&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Wanderlust: A History of Walking&lt;/em&gt;, she writes that we generally live in a "series of interiors ... disconnected from each other." Walking connects us, to one another and the world itself. "One lives in the whole world rather than in interiors built up against it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add science writer Maura O'Connor to the list of thinkers championing walking. Her new book, &lt;em&gt;Wayfinding: The Science and Mystery of How Humans Navigate the World&lt;/em&gt;, isn't about the art of placing one foot in front of another, but about how humans navigate their terrain — and what is lost when we offload our hard-earned navigation skills to GPS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wayfinding&lt;/em&gt; is not a romanticized screed against technology, yet it does point to important consequences that a lack of landmarking has had on our brains. Toward the end of the book, she speculates on a topic I've &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/gps-bad-brain-effect" target="_blank"&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; often: the potential that technology and automation will increase cases of dementia. What is being sacrificed in our quest for convenience? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Connor is a brilliant writer, a refreshing voice in a deluge of misspelled tweets and Snapchat. (During &lt;em&gt;The Portal&lt;/em&gt;, when asked what books have inspired him, Herzog replied that no single book would suffice as an answer; &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; is what matters.) The book documents her travels dogsledding in the Canadian arctic and wandering through Australian deserts. Even if you had no interest in the subject matter, &lt;em&gt;Wayfinding&lt;/em&gt; is simply a joy to read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we should all be invested in our future. I recently &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/derekberes/earthrise-podcast-67-the-mystery-and-science-of-navigation-with-maura-oconnor" target="_blank"&gt;spoke with O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, who was in her office in Gowanus, an area I spent years walking around aimlessly; every Friday I meandered from Tribeca to Park Slope to mark the end of my work week. New York's grid-like structure and giant landmarks make it difficult to get lost in, yet I'd always walk along different blocks and cross various bridges over the canal to better understand my neighborhood. Getting lost forces you to think critically and problem-solve; there is simply no downloadable replacement for those essential skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss GPS and driverless cars in more detail during our talk, which I'll save for a future article on the topic. The first half of our talk generally centered on her fascinating experiences while wayfinding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="578Y2I1564683967" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="83a82" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0NzUxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NTMyMzMwNH0.tbJfeZI5elY6eGFp876R2R39LUiFGp63Cz7_t-Pnm88/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C89%2C0%2C14&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: What was the inspiration for this book?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maura&lt;/strong&gt;: I had not thought much about navigation before starting this book. A lot of writers tend to overestimate the importance of their subject matter. But I can genuinely say that navigation is a strange phenomena in the sense that it is something that every single one of us is engaged in every single day of our lives. But it is not something that many of us give much thought to or step back to think about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment that my attention was drawn to navigation in my own life was after having used a smartphone with a GPS device in it for almost eight years. I was using it in a very rural part of New Mexico and it basically led me astray. I was trying to find a hot spring; I put the location into my phone and the GPS directed me to drive to the banks of the Rio Grande.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was like, "Wow, why do I have such unquestioned faith in my GPS to tell me where to go?" I had that experience and then started thinking more broadly about how it is that gadgets infiltrate themselves into our lives in ways that we don't necessarily question. In this case, what does it mean to outsource a cognitive skill to a gadget and what are the implications and effects of that? The book really grew out of that question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: You write that "getting lost is a uniquely human problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maura&lt;/strong&gt;: If you consider how many species of animals depend on precise navigation to survive, you see how this is a phenomenon that is really critical to evolution. If there were species that were prone to becoming lost, they wouldn't survive. Humans, on the other hand, do seem to have this ability, which is confounding. It seems to me that the reason for that is we really don't have the same kind of biological hardware that a lot of other species have that can tell us almost instinctively or intuitively where we are at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are countless mysteries about how different species do what they do, but compared to humans, there's no real doubt that we are pretty miserable navigators compared to even a butterfly or a lowly aphid, let alone leatherback turtles that travel 6,000 miles over an open ocean to get from one habitat to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've created cultural traditions and ways of transmitting and teaching skills from one generation to the next. We use culture to make up for the deficit of biological mechanisms that other species seem to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: I really appreciated your deep dive into maps as metaphors for the cultures that create them. It made me think of the very common world map that we grew up with in America. Our country seems as large as Africa even though we can basically fit inside of the Congo. What does the type of map that someone creates tell them about the culture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maura&lt;/strong&gt;: I realized pretty quickly during my research and talking to different anthropologists and going to some of the places that you mentioned [the Arctic and Australia] was that maps, to my surprise, are not universal, whether a physical paper map or a cognitive map. There is extensive debate in anthropology and neuroscience and psychology over whether or not maps are culturally universal. What I found was, based on my own readings, they're not. That raises this really interesting question: How could we possibly find our way without a map?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That instrument is so central to anybody who's grown up in an urban environment or in Western culture that it's almost inconceivable to think of other strategies for navigation. But actually there's this astonishing range of human navigation systems that use observation, memory perception, environmental cues, and different types of language to describe space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may not use a God-like bird's eye view of space, but actually use a different type of strategy. Sometimes it's called route-finding: "Here is the tree and, after the tree, there will be a mountain, and after the mountain there will be a lake." You're really navigating from the perspective of the individual on the ground moving through space. That's one of the most satisfying revelations that I discovered through writing the book because it just deepens the mystery and diversity around human culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;GPS and the Human Journey - M.R. O’Connor | The Open Mind&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="D53W8Y1564683967" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2VXvcF_W1U?rel=0?enablejsapi=1" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: Our brains have this very unique paradox in that we are attracted to novelty and new situations, but at the same time we will default to the easiest possible way if it's going to conserve energy. We want speed and efficiency. Did anyone in the course of your book discuss what is lost when they transition to more convenient tools for navigation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maura&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. I went to Nunavut, which is a sovereign part of the Canadian Arctic. You kind of expect to just show up and say, "Which hunters can take me out on their dog sleds?" I discovered this was like showing up in New York City in the 21st century and being like, "Hey, who can take me on a ride on a horse and carriage?" It was quickly explained to me that hunters are not very romantic. If there is a practical advantage of using a rifle over a harpoon, then that is a choice they will make because the necessities of hunting in the Arctic are so challenging and extreme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that a lot of hunters, even those using traditional navigation skills, use snowmobiles. Some of the hunters told me is that the biggest difference between being on a dog sled and a snowmobile when you're trying to navigate is speed and how much you can actually attend to when you're traveling 60 miles an hour versus 15 miles an hour. Traditional Inuit navigation relies on this attention to detail because the landmarks in the Arctic are so different from what anyone from the south would consider a landmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I also saw was a tremendous effort on the part of community leaders and hunters in those communities to preserve these skills and pass them down to the next generation. It's not just about hunting; navigation is extremely crucial to Inuit identity and culture. It ties into language, it ties into oral storytelling, it ties into their relationship and the stewardship of the land itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: You also write that narration may have begun in hunting society. You were talking about how a tracker in Australia imagines being in the mind and body of the author of the trackway and then creates a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maura&lt;/strong&gt;: I think this link between navigation and storytelling was also something that was unexpected to me. We are the only species that seems to have so thoroughly used memory to assist us in the task of navigation. That's what's called episodic memory, which is our ability to recall events that happened in the past based in the hippocampus, which is the same exact area of the brain where navigation and spatial orientation takes place. Interestingly, the hippocampus is also this part in the brain that allows us to imagine ourselves in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the hippocampus is intrinsic to this ability to develop narratives and stories about where we were in the past, how we came to be, where we are now, and where we are going in the future. It is really interesting that navigation may have helped us to develop this narrative capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different cultures have used this narrative capacity as a sort of mnemonic device; they've used stories as devices to encapsulate topographic information. The best example of that, as you mentioned, is aboriginal Australians, who have tens and tens of thousands of years of history of using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;songlines&lt;/a&gt;. Those are essentially stories about how aboriginal Australians ancestors created the topography of the landscape through their travels in a time called the dream time. The journeys of those ancestors are recorded in songs and stories that people learn and memorize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Songlines are not just repositories for incredible environmental ecological knowledge, aboriginal law, and history, but that they're also navigation aids. These journeys are actually routes that people could literally follow through the landscape to get from one place to the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="WKEKI91564683967" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ccb90" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0NzUyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NDk5MTk3NX0.qHQCwBe4bbUXAV3BNT3ZrqyrL-liqEfqZwgPsc6myQ8/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C55%2C0%2C11&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: I initially reached out to you after your &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ditch-the-gps-its-ruining-your-brain/2019/06/05/29a3170e-87af-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html?utm_term=.830d2d8cda29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;book was excerpted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. The excerpt focused on how GPS is damaging our brains. What do you think is being lost when we're using devices like GPS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maura&lt;/strong&gt;: The psychologist James Gibson came to the conclusion that this whole idea of Cartesian dualism, that we're not actually interacting directly with the world around us because the brain is this mechanistic process that's creating images of the world for us and we're never in direct contact, wasn't really satisfying. He created all these tests to test the idea of a theory he called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_psychology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ecological psychology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the brain is just part of a complete visual system and that natural vision involves eyes in our heads connected to a body which is walking on the ground. Unencumbered exploration is really about us looking at things from all perspectives moving forward. I don't think it was his main objective, but he created this alternative theory of navigation, which is that navigation really depends on us directing our attention and directly perceiving the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won't argue that GPS is not an incredibly powerful tool that has many positive benefits for us to use. But I think there's no debate that it really changes the way we direct our attention. It seduces our attention downward, whereas what Gibson was talking about is this very powerful directing of attention, giving attention to the environment and paying attention to what we see as we move through the environment. Those two things are just really different practices and perhaps we can argue the benefits of one over the other in different contexts. But I do think that using a gadget really changes that process a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: You cite a 2008 study about people walking while using GPS (as compared to experience or paper maps) walk more slowly and make greater direction errors; it was also tougher for them to find their way. I personally believe that we're going to see a massive uptick in degenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maura&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a pretty nascent field of study, but there are studies coming out of different areas of cognitive disease, aging memory, and navigation, as well pointing at an interesting relationships between spatial orientation strategies, the hippocampus, and cognitive disease. They're not showing a direct relationship between using a device to find your way and turn-by-turn directions. But what they're showing is that our attention really changes when we use those devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're finding out about how the hippocampus changes as we're using different technologies. There's lots of information about diseases like Alzheimer's, dementia, PTSD, and even depression that shows that atrophy in the hippocampus is in many cases universal among those afflictions, particularly Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay in touch with Derek on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/derekberes" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If the media properly covered these topics, we would &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be talking about how children are abused. Sadly, the reason we're discussing it now is due to these men's links to the current administration. Better that than nothing, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; talk about these topics often; they just aren't heard all that much. Regan Williams, the CEO and co-founder of the nonprofit, &lt;a href="http://www.seenandheard.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Seen and Heard&lt;/a&gt;, has made taking care of and raising awareness of foster youth a focus of her life. Having known Regan for a number of years, it is refreshing to watch someone so fully try to create a better world for the underserved, especially as those in need are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They need our help. As you'll read in our conversation below (&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/derekberes/earthrise-podcast-66-a-conversation-on-foster-youth-and-sex-trafficking-with-regan-williams" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;listen to our talk here&lt;/a&gt;), 300,000 children in America are trafficked for sex every year; the global number is in the millions. Sadly, foster youth are a prime target for traffickers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations like Seen and Heard are essential for helping to raise children to be empowered adults. The nonprofit teaches social and career skills through performing arts. As Williams mentions below, most foster youth have experienced trauma, often physical abuse or sexual trauma. Acting and role playing offer them opportunities to cooperate and collaborate while thinking critically and creatively. No child deserves abuse from the worst of us.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="UYLC2E1564681444" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="d7edd" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0NzU1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NTI3NTMyN30.A_qjvmuxGzd-EhKXU72iLhacbzIxC4YNhI6j9YsxPDY/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C12%2C0%2C81&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: You've worked with foster youth for a long time and you've also cared for three foster daughters. What are the biggest challenges you've had?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: The things that pose the largest challenges I've experienced really have to do with behavior. Usually when a child is removed from their home, there's been a significant amount of trauma or neglect. You're almost always going to be getting a kid that has some pretty significant behavioral challenges, like reactive attachment disorder or fetal alcohol syndrome or drug exposure in utero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It affects how they can learn and it also affects how to correct or discipline them. Traditional disciplinary measures just don't work with kids that have experienced trauma or have learning delays or disabilities or mental health issues. So you have to have proper training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: You started a nonprofit, &lt;a href="http://www.seenandheard.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Seen and Heard&lt;/a&gt;, which develops character through performance art training. Why did you choose that direction to work with foster youth? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: Both my husband and I have backgrounds in performing arts. We noticed that our training really is a transferable skill set. There are a lot of services being provided for foster youth as far as jobs training. There are a lot of life skills-style training, yet there seems to be [a lack of] professional skills for a lot of transitional-age youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is basically for kids between the ages of 16 and 21. You could provide employment or a college education scholarship for these young people, but the likelihood of them retaining their job or completing their education is more unlikely. That's because when kids are bounced around from home to home or living in a group home environment, they really have created a lot of maladaptive behavior over the years to protect themselves or get their needs met. Receiving constructive criticism or collaborating with others are skills that haven't had a chance to take root. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that a performing arts education — for example, improvisation or scene study, creating a character, working with a scene partner — are directly applicable to a workplace environment. Even a skill like mindfulness is something that actors really have to build before they can take on a role or enter into the life of the character. You have to empty out and focus on your breathing. You have to be present in your physical body. That skill is tremendously hard for young people who have experienced trauma because their default is to escape, lash out, fight, flight, or freeze. We're building on EQ or soft skills through the performing arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Epstein case is not an outlier. Child sex trafficking is 'pervasive' in the U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="JTUT0Z1564681444" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQrGllBmUxU?rel=0?enablejsapi=1" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: On your site, you write that there are 61,000 youths in foster care in California, which is almost the same number as homeless people in Los Angeles County. I know these are two disparate populations, but at the same time, you can argue that both of these populations don't have anywhere they can call home. I wonder why, with all of the focus on homelessness, do you think that foster care is not something as a culture we talk about nearly as much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh man, that's such a good question. I've asked myself that over and over. By and large children are invisible unless they're put on a stage or they're commodified or sexualized. In addition, no kid is going to want to put on a t-shirt that says "I'm a foster kid." They're hard to identify because they're not identifying themselves. When you have a population of homeless people in Los Angeles, it's visible. You see it everywhere. Foster youth technically have a place to live, but there's a difference between home and shelter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: Speaking of sexualization, you initially reached out to me about having this talk with the Jeffrey Epstein case in the news. Do you think now that we're going to start hearing more about sex trafficking and take it more seriously? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: There are 300,000 American children every year that are involved and being commercially trafficked...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: Sorry to interrupt, but this is beyond sexual abuse. You're talking commercially trafficked? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I's a lot. It's a $150 billion a year industry globally, just under drug trafficking. It's a very, very lucrative industry. It's such a common thing to have a child be sexually molested. Of the three girls that we brought in when we were fostering, two had experienced some form of sexual abuse or molestation. I'm not sure what the statistics are as far as how many youth that are in foster care have been sexually abused or assaulted. I'm sure that number is very high. Nobody talks about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's so fascinating about Epstein is that, "Oh, so now we're going to start the conversation about trafficking," when people don't understand that there's been thousands and thousands of young people — for the most part, women with a median age of 11-15 — and this has been going on for quite some time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there's been legal changes. &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1322" target="_blank"&gt;Senate Bill 1322&lt;/a&gt; prohibits law enforcement officers from arresting minors for prostitution. Still, people aren't talking it very much. I wonder if it's because these are poor communities; these are black and brown girls, sometimes boys as well, but for the most part girls, and because Epstein is a high-powered, wealthy individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: When the Epstein case first reopened, there were members of Congress that were trying to place the blame on the victims. This isn't uncommon, but I think it was especially unsettling because it was children. For a while you heard the media reference them as "young women." How does that make you feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: It's hard to put into words because so often young women aren't believed. It's just heartbreaking when I hear things like that. It's even tougher for young women that do not have a support system. Hopefully, the women that have been assaulted and abused by Epstein have that kind of support system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;There are a lot of foster parents where, if an allegation is made against them by a youth, the Department of Children and Family Services absolutely takes that seriously. We'll make an unannounced visit to make sure that everything is in order. But it's so sad that when you have a situation where abuse is happening and a social worker comes out and removes a child (and has evidence that there has been abuse and neglect), if that young woman does not want to go home because she's being abused by an uncle or a father or older brother, she has to testify. In many cases, a family member or relative is in that same courtroom when she is expected to testify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="1L0PMV1564681444" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="dd26d" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0MDgyNi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NTIzOTEwNH0.-FPLj-i6N0lzQZFg-O3lF_rjwTOrkDfL9aOhV-yvsng/img.png?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C52%2C0%2C71&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: We've talked over the years extensively about religion and hold different views in terms of the metaphysics of religion. But I really appreciate the moral and ethical aspects, how they're instilled in cultures and societies. When you're seeing what's happening, say with Epstein or the border crisis, where people espouse religiosity in their personal lives but then don't follow up with their moral obligations, what do you think about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: The first thing that comes to mind is something that Jesus said. He had a bunch of little children gathered around him and his disciples were saying, "Let's get these kids out of here, they're wasting our time." Jesus really valued children. He said we as adults need to come to God with a sense of wonder, desire, belief, all those things. What he said is just profound to me: "Whoever causes one of these little ones to stumble, it would be better for him to have a millstone tied around their neck and dropped into the ocean." I know it sounds vengeful, but it gives me so much comfort to know that Jesus took that so seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it happens more often these days in this administration. People talk one moment about a Christian principle or an idea and then the very next statement might be just shocking because oftentimes we do not see justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek&lt;/strong&gt;: I want to ask an extremely difficult question, but it's one that I've thought about because there are organizations that exist for adults who are attracted to children but don't want to be. If you look at the advances we've had in our understanding of genes, we might find that there's a certain genetic composition or brain chemistry of people who are attracted to children. These organizations are saying, we're trying not to be stigmatized here, we're looking for therapeutic resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regan&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not sure what the statistics are, but I would say the vast majority of people that perpetrate sexual crimes against children were themselves abused as a child. I almost see that as a generational epidemic. If your uncle or father molested you, you have a higher likelihood of molesting when you become an adult. That's not universal, but I do believe that that's one of the factors to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor is pornography. There are women that are 18 that play far, far younger. We sexualize children in role play or fantasy. Unfortunately, there's plenty of child pornography out there. There is a certain aspect of building an appetite for viewing pornography with younger and younger subjects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like it's nature and nurture that we're dealing with, but as far as rehabilitation, I am all for that because I'm on the other side of it. I'm mostly concerned with advocating and caring for young people that are coming out of the system. Most of those young people have had a history of sexual abuse or physical abuse. I haven't really paid a whole lot of attention to the other side, but to take a first pass at it, I would say we should be providing services for people that are wanting out of the trap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay in touch with Derek on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/derekberes" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/g9IluBvT_B8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2019 12:24:06 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/child-sex-trafficking</guid><category>Women</category><category>Sexual violence</category><category>Trafficking</category><category>United states</category><category>Crime</category><dc:creator>Derek Beres</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20339872/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/child-sex-trafficking</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Rules for civil engagement: How to talk with someone unlike yourself</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/OLdR7h22sXI/rules-for-civil-engagement-how-to-talk-with-someone-unlike-yourself</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20507648/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a basic set of rules you can use when talking with someone who believes different things than you do, says Jonathan Zimmerman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statements like, "You're a blankety-blank" close discussions rather than open them. Instead, say, "You know, that's interesting. That's not the way I see it. Tell me more about why you think that." Being more open about your intentions can help, too. Tell the person that you see the issue from a different angle, and ask them what they think of your view. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A key rule for civil discourse, especially in this political climate, is to recognize the difference between emotion and argument. The depth of conviction with which something is said is not a substitute for argument quality or truth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

An early period of intense attraction tends to develop into a less fiery, deeper attachment bond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to evolutionary arguments, the early stage, which typically lasts a few years, gives the pair the time and proximity that's required for developing a deeper nurturing, supportive – and predictable – relationship. While this type of attachment is important for rearing children, and for ongoing wellbeing, it's not necessarily great news for passion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though passion can still be experienced in the later stages, it tends to decline, on average," note the authors of a &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21952-001" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. They go on, however, to report that there is a group of people who experience higher sustained levels of both supportive warmth and nurturance &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; eroticism than is typical in relationships – only, they don't get both from the same partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhonda Balzarini at York University, Canada and colleagues conducted the first empirical test of differences between eroticism and nurturance among participants who were in either a monogamous or a polyamorous relationship. Someone in a polyamorous relationship typically has a primary partner (they usually live with this person who is often their spouse and the co-parent of their children if they have any) and also, with the consent of that person, a secondary romantic partner. Relationships with secondary partners tend to last for at least a few years, allowing for some nurturance, as well as sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited their polyamorous participants – more than one thousand of them – from Facebook and Reddit groups dedicated to polyamory discussions. These individuals had been with their primary partner for an average of seven years, and with their secondary partner for two. They completed questionnaires that asked about levels of nurturance (to what extent they felt a strong sense of security, love, warmth, etc) and eroticism (including their felt levels of desire and lust, and sexual excitement) in each relationship, how close they felt to each partner, and also their levels of sexual satisfaction. The team also collected similar data on over two thousand monogamous people, who had been in an exclusive relationship for an average of 17 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers had predicted, the polyamorists enjoyed more nurturance from their primary than from their secondary, partners, on average, and gave higher eroticism ratings to their secondary relationships. Overall, their eroticism ratings were higher than for the monogamists. More surprisingly, their nurturance ratings for their primary relationship were higher than those reported by the monogamists. These differences held even when the researchers controlled for the differences in relationship length between the two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also some differences in sexual satisfaction and closeness. Among the monogamous participants, eroticism and nurturance were both positively associated with sexual satisfaction and closeness. For the polyamorists, nurturance was similarly linked to feelings of closeness in both their relationships, but eroticism was only associated with sexual satisfaction and closeness in their secondary relationships,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings have broad research implications for the study of romantic relationships," the researchers write. "The belief that monogamy is superior to other relationship orientations is a fundamental and often unquestioned assumption underlying contemporary theories of the development of romantic relationships and intimacy." And yet, they go on: "The findings suggest that polyamory may provide a unique opportunity for individuals to experience both eroticism and nurturance simultaneously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various caveats, however. An important one is that, when it comes to the nurturance data, someone who tolerates their partner having an ongoing relationship with somebody else is arguably likely to be a more supportive individual in the first place – and/or it's likely that a deeper attachment is required for a primary partnership to be sustained during polyamory. The results can't be seen to imply than any couple could decide to take on secondary partners and expect to enjoy the benefits reported by the polyamorists in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the research does highlight some possible benefits of being polyamorous, at least for some people. The researchers would now like to see work exploring whether relying on different partners to meet nurturance and erotic needs, rather than just one, could enhance life satisfaction and personal wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-21952-001" target="_blank"&gt;Eroticism versus nurturance: How eroticism and nurturance differs in polyamorous and monogamous relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emmayoung.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Emma Young&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaELYoung" target="_blank"&gt;@EmmaELYoung&lt;/a&gt;) is Staff Writer at &lt;a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;BPS Research Digest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reprinted with permission of &lt;a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;The British Psychological Society&lt;/a&gt;.

With more satellites and rockets launching each year, collisions with space junk are becoming more likely. Losing a satellite could mean your TV reception is poor or the weather forecast is a bit less reliable. But it could also mean aeroplanes can't navigate properly and people aren't made aware of a tornado that's bearing down towards them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long-term solution is needed to clean up space. &lt;a href="https://www.gatewayearth.space" target="_blank"&gt;The Gateway Earth Development Group&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of academics from universities around the world who propose turning this potential catastrophe into a resource. By 2050, Gateway Earth – a fully operational space station with a facility to recycle old satellites and other junk – could be up and running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Earth's orbits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main orbits that satellites exist in. &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Transportation/Types_of_orbits/(print)" target="_blank"&gt;Low Earth Orbit&lt;/a&gt; (LEO) is about 200 km to 1,000 km above the Earth and is where the International Space Station orbits the planet every 90 minutes, along with thousands of other satellites. At 36,000 km, the forces acting on satellites cause them to stay in the same place within their orbit. This is called &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Transportation/Types_of_orbits/(print)" target="_blank"&gt;Geostationary Earth Orbit&lt;/a&gt; (GEO). Satellites here are stationary above a single point on Earth, making them useful for weather forecasting and communications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEO is very &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/esatv/Videos/2017/04/Space_debris_2017_-_a_journey_to_Earth/Low_Earth_orbit" target="_blank"&gt;crowded&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a risk of collisions here which could create &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Rocket_scientists_challenge_do_the_Kessler_run" target="_blank"&gt;a shower of debris&lt;/a&gt; so wide it collides with other satellites, creating more and more debris in a chain reaction. Eventually the entire orbit could become so full of debris it's unusable. A lot of debris already litters LEO, but technology is being &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/keep-your-local-orbit-tidy-two-techniques-for-tackling-the-problem-of-space-junk-62030" target="_blank"&gt;developed and tested to remove it&lt;/a&gt;. The situation is more tricky for GEO, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In GEO, when a satellite comes towards the end of its life, the owners will attempt to put it in a higher &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-04-satellites-die.html" target="_blank"&gt;“graveyard" orbit&lt;/a&gt; where it's left to drift about 300 km to 400 km away from an internationally agreed &lt;a href="http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AD4RequirementsSpaceDebrisMitigationESA_Projects.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;protection zone&lt;/a&gt;. But only about 80% of all satellites that reach the end of their life in GEO actually make it to the graveyard orbit. The other 20% need dealing with as a matter of urgency – and that's where a recycling facility in space could help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recycling in space&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graveyard orbit is effectively an &lt;a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/The_GEO_Graveyard_May_Not_Be_Permanent_999.html" target="_blank"&gt;abandoned junkyard&lt;/a&gt; with no caretaker. Flashes of bright light have been seen in there and it's believed satellites are colliding or exploding from unused fuel or degraded batteries, these debris have the potential to fall back to GEO, threatening satellites there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law currently isn't on the side of a collective solution to space junk. Even if an out-of-control satellite is heading towards one that's functioning and worth billions of dollars, international agreements forbid action to remove it without the owner's permission, even if a &lt;a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/58bc6d_8417f4086c4e4df8a9da9a8662754382.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;space drone&lt;/a&gt; could intervene and take it to the graveyard orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;By repairing, repurposing or recycling satellites and "space junk" at a facility in Earth's orbit, this material could help build future spacecraft or exploration outposts, like &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-build-a-moon-base-120259" target="_blank"&gt;a base on the moon&lt;/a&gt;. Using what's already floating around up there means there are no launch costs and using those resources will reduce space junk. It's the equivalent of building a home in the UK from local materials rather than importing bricks from Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recycling satellites could provide not just raw materials for more construction in space, but a revenue stream to fund it. &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328654352_How_Can_Humans_Thrive_and_Service_Satellites_in_a_Geostationary_Orbit" target="_blank"&gt;My research&lt;/a&gt; showed that an orbit 150 km further out that GEO Gateway Earth would have access to the whole of GEO. From there whole satellites could be taken by &lt;a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/58bc6d_8417f4086c4e4df8a9da9a8662754382.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;space drones&lt;/a&gt; into the floating recycling centre for a tune-up if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing these services could bring in over &lt;a href="https://www.gatewayearth.space/research/BIS-RS-2017-48.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;USD$8 billion&lt;/a&gt; per year, but the &lt;a href="http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties.html" target="_blank"&gt;space laws&lt;/a&gt; that would govern this work are outdated and need revising. Luckily, this is something the UN are already working on, and our members are working with them to overcome barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these satellites are no longer serviceable, the shell could be used for other purposes. Some of the recycled materials from space junk could be ground down and used to 3D print radiation shielding for Gateway Earth. &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Inside_a_solar_cell" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that the efficiency of solar panels from disused satellites only drops to about 24% after 15 years, so these could be gathered and used to power the station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most advanced cameras ever built are in space. These could be refitted onto Gateway Earth or new satellites to scan space &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Safety/Near-Earth_Objects_-_NEO_Segment" target="_blank"&gt;for asteroids&lt;/a&gt; that could collide with Earth. As the business of deploying and using satellites is set to grow at &lt;a href="https://www.gatewayearth.space/research/BIS-RS-2017-48.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a phenomenal rate&lt;/a&gt;, having an outpost in orbit that can manage all of them will become vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gateway Earth has plans to &lt;a href="https://www.gatewayearth.space/research" target="_blank"&gt;generate further revenue&lt;/a&gt; in future by acting as a space hotel, a satellite and spacecraft construction facility and a fuelling hub for spacecraft travelling between planets. We need a space equivalent for the plastics wake-up call that people heard from &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1FlfcGGKPSWv3m7JdfBT5dv/get-involved-with-ocean-conservation" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Planet 2&lt;/a&gt;. There is still time, but plans for cleaning up Earth's orbit need to be acted on now. Over the next ten years, &lt;a href="https://www.satellitetoday.com/innovation/2017/10/12/satellite-launches-increase-threefold-next-decade" target="_blank"&gt;150 new GEO satellites&lt;/a&gt; are planned which will increase the risk of collision significantly.&lt;img alt="The Conversation" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/119787/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/jez-turner-773502" target="_blank"&gt;Jez Turner&lt;/a&gt;, Teaching Associate in Foundation Engineering and Physical Sciences, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-nottingham-1192" target="_blank"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

It's the most trees ever planted by a nation in a single day, breaking India's previously held record of about 66 million trees in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to encourage Ethiopians to plant 4 billion trees during the 2019 "rainy season" between May and October. Ethiopia has so far planted 2.6 billion trees this year, and Monday's effort put some 353,633,660 into the ground, the country's minister for innovation and technology, Getahun Mekuria, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrGetahun/status/1155875490407886848" target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="NAMOEF1564527932" frameborder="0" height="150" id="twitter-embed-1155875490407886848" scrolling="no" src="/res/community/twitter_embed/?iframe_id=twitter-embed-1155875490407886848&amp;created_ts=1564417166.0&amp;screen_name=DrGetahun&amp;text=353%2C633%2C660+Tree+Seedlings+Planted+in+12+Hours.+This+is+in+%23Ethiopians+%0A%0ARegional+Shares+of+Trees+Planted+today.%E2%80%A6+https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FK8qt8EoALD&amp;id=1155875490407886848&amp;name=Dr.-Ing.+Getahun+Mekuria" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia – Africa's second most populous nation – has suffered rapid deforestation since the mid-20th century, due mainly to its booming population. According to the forest management organization Farm Africa, Ethiopia's forested regions have decreased from about 30 percent at the end of the 19th century to less than &lt;a href="https://www.farmafrica.org/media/press-releases/post/720-economic-incentives-help-stem-deforestation-in-ethiopia" target="_blank"&gt;4 percent today&lt;/a&gt;. The problem isn't only environmental, but also economic, considering the agriculture sector accounts for some 85 percent of jobs in the West African nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="G3AU2P1564527932" frameborder="0" height="150" id="twitter-embed-1155771473178570753" scrolling="no" src="/res/community/twitter_embed/?iframe_id=twitter-embed-1155771473178570753&amp;created_ts=1564392367.0&amp;screen_name=amirabiy&amp;text=%23GreenLegacy+is+a+vision+for+the+next+generation.+It+is+creating+a+blueprint+for+them+and+showing+them+the+way.%E2%80%A6+https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FtngOdTTAwR&amp;id=1155771473178570753&amp;name=Amir+Aman%2C+MD" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's maybe partly why the Ethiopian government chose to directly appeal to its 110 million citizens, asking each to plant 40 seedlings, and closing government offices to allow workers to "go out and make your mark." In 2017, Ethiopia joined more than 20 other African nations by signing onto the AFR100 (the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative), which aims to &lt;a href="https://afr100.org/" target="_blank"&gt;restore&lt;/a&gt; 100 million hectares of land by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can forest restoration fight climate change?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because plants remove carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, reforestation could be a natural and effective way to slow climate change. Of course, making a significant dent in atmospheric carbon levels would require a ton of trees, as a &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/reforestation?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_blank"&gt;recent study published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; found.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that planting the right trees on .09 billion &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare" target="_blank"&gt;hectares&lt;/a&gt; of available land across the globe would remove 205 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over the next 40 to 100 years. That's about two thirds of the estimated 300 gigatons humans have already added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"The point is that [reforestation is] so much more vastly powerful than anyone ever expected," Thomas Crowther, a professor of environmental systems science at ETH Zurich and a co-author of the paper, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/4/20681331/climate-change-solutions-trees-deforestation-reforestation" target="_blank"&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. "By far, it's the top climate change solution in terms of carbon storage potential."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the global community isn't close to implementing such a massive, coordinated reforestation campaign, some researchers &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/4/20681331/climate-change-solutions-trees-deforestation-reforestation" target="_blank"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the recent study was helpful for mapping specific areas where trees could regrow. In any case, reforestation seems to be an effective tool against climate change, but it's not the quickest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"...it will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential," Crowther told The Guardian. "It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions, and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies in order to avoid dangerous climate change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/DXVE2KMGMpU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 15:44:33 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/ethiopia-trees</guid><category>Environment</category><category>Africa</category><category>Climate change</category><category>Biology</category><category>Sustainability</category><category>Global issues</category><dc:creator>Stephen  Johnson</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20505599/980x.png" medium="image" type="image/png" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/ethiopia-trees</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>What proof is there that the universe is evolving?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/7AeIse3pgl0/michelle-thaller-2639494132</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20504506/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light moves at 186,000 miles per second. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As fast as light speed is, when you think about how large the universe is, light takes time — a lot of time — to actually get to us from distant objects. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sun is about 93 million miles away.

From the vast invaded area of the USSR, here shown superimposed on a map of the United States, 38,000,000 Russians escaped the Nazis in 1941 by fleeing their homes. Strafed by dive bombers and machine-gunning "hedge-hoppers," they fled across their country before the invaders while their Red Army fought and fell back – fought and fell back. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Omaha, capital of the USSR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="SV23571564670554" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="fd192" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDQ3Mjg4Ny85ODB4LnBuZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjUxOTQ1NTJ9.f2xki1UZzNA7T0WD7fjVvJ8Btm-V59RomF0hpxTtN2o/img.png"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of the map of America, 38,000,000 persons walked and rode across more than half the United States. They left behind them – besides their homes – the lands which fed them, the mines which fed their factories, their clothing, their hospitals, their schools, their nurseries – in short, their lives. In the land to which they went there was almost none of these things. They built new factories first, ploughed the land second. Now they are building new homes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But – even as we would be – they are often cold, often hungry, always physically exhausted. They need help. But the fate of those who escaped is not the worst fate in Russia. Forty million of the residents of the invaded area did not escape! They stayed. From forest hideouts they have seen the Nazis burn their homes, truck away their stores of food, their clothing, even their household equipment. Some, staying in their homes to meet the invaders, have been robbed of all they owned… and many have been killed.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;​By the time I get to Tashkent&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="8Z2JDJ1564670554" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="774a5" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDQ3Mjk1MS85ODB4LnBuZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjQ4NjYwNzF9.STQz5I_xDBfuZhLqwi_3YvaEP8sEm7kcutSX-CBAwPI/img.png"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the survivors now are returning to homes recaptured by the Red Army. They return to almost utter desolation. They, too, need help. Ten million have died in the fight that is theirs and ours. The Red Army has lost almost as many men, in killed and wounded, as are now in all the American armed forces! Civilians have died – by millions – of malnutrition, cold, exhaustion, disease – and of the Nazi hangman's noose and the bullets of Nazi firing squads. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet homes are sheltering the war's orphans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Look at the map.&lt;em&gt; Imagine the tragedy to you and your family if an invader had ravaged America throughout all that shaded territory on our Atlantic seaboard, westward all the way to St. Louis and Tulsa.

Most of the civilized world understands that we need to put forth new, alternative solutions of generating energy to curb our greenhouse emissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paris Agreement, for instance, set an ambitious global goal to limit global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) by transitioning away from fossil fuels into renewables. However, a new extensive &lt;a href="https://earthworks.org/publications/responsible-minerals-sourcing-for-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;research report by the environmental non-profit Earthworks&lt;/a&gt; has found that this shift into a fossil fuel-free economy comes with its own set of egregious  societal and conservationist problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blind rush to get "100 percent" renewable energy usage will get us nowhere. It's the same industrialist mindset that got us into this pickle. We need to approach this next energy wave with caution and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Renewable energy transition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean technologies require a wide variety of rare earth metals and other minerals, mostly including cobalt, nickel, lithium, aluminum, and silver. Batteries for electric cars makeup the biggest driver of mineral acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author, Elsa Dominish, remarks that, "A rapid increase in demand for metals for renewable energy. . . could lead to mining of marginal or unconventional resources, which are often in more remote or biodiverse places."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these areas rich in minerals are remote wilderness, which have yet to be touched by any commercial endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The transition toward a renewable energy and transport system requires a complex mix of metals — such as copper, cobalt, nickel, rare earths, lithium, and silver — many of which have only previously been mined in small amounts," states Earthworks' report, in reference to the supply chains of the 14 most important minerals used in renewable energy production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payal Sampat, director of Earthworks' Mining Program, sees this as a crucial time to focus on the core aspects of what an environmental movement should be focusing on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have an opportunity, if we act now, to ensure that our emerging clean energy economy is truly clean–as well as just and equitable–and not dependent on dirty mining. As we scale up clean energy technologies in pursuit of our necessarily ambitious climate goals, we must protect community health, water, human rights, and the environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the supposition that all of human society would use 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, researchers charted out what other aspects of the environment would be affected as we attempted to reach this goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study explores the impacts that mining has on human society and culture, as well as the potential for even greater losses of biodiversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a world running completely on renewables, the metal requirements would be astronomical. The only way you're going to feed this need is by opening up more mines worldwide. Combined with our unsustainable mining practices, we'll be doing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large scale commercial strip mining of forests, slave labor, and ecological destruction would all be necessary to feed our current "green dream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Industrialism is the problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mineral extraction levies an incredible cost on the communities and ecological landscape of a place. Material mined for renewable energy fuels the violation of human rights, pollutes local water sources, and often destroys wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cobalt, which is the most important component of rechargeable batteries, is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo; often by children in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/longform/blood-sweat-and-batteries/" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous working conditions.&lt;/a&gt; The authors of the report found that cobalt is the "metal of most concern for supply risks," as 60 percent of its production occurs in Congo, a country with an abysmal record of human and environmental catastrophes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Amnesty International found that more than two dozen major electronics and automotive companies were failing to ensure that their supply chains of cobalt didn't include child labor. Amnesty blamed both Congolese officials and Western tech companies for ignoring the problems endemic to their supply chain. Irresponsible and dangerous cobalt mining is a global problem. &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr62/3183/2016/en/" target="_blank"&gt;According to the report,&lt;/a&gt; China's Congo Dongfang International Mining (CDM) owns exclusive rights to one quarter of the cobalt ore, of which the mines it flows from all employ child labor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The renewable energy transition will only be sustainable if it ensures human rights for the communities where the mining to supply renewable energy and battery technologies takes place," said Dominish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sustainability and conservation &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, write the authors, "Reducing the environmental and social impacts of supply is not a major focus of the renewable energy industry. In order for there to be a potential solution to all of this, there must be a convergence of different industries within the environmentalist movement. The recognition of renewable energy companies with conservationists, in &lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;particular&lt;/span&gt;, needs to be at the forefront.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If manufacturers commit to responsible sourcing this will encourage more mines to engage in responsible practices and certification. There is also an urgent need to invest in recycling and reuse schemes to ensure the valuable metals used in these technologies are recovered, so only what is necessary is mined," states the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recycling sources will be one way to mitigate demand, but this won't stop new mining developments from popping up in fragile wildlife areas. This is why responsible sourcing needs to be the next best step if these mines are going to be created, anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/pjkcgvYdRX8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:29:22 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/renewable-energy-dirty-mining</guid><category>Environment</category><category>Environmental footprint</category><category>Clean energy</category><category>Renewables</category><category>Climate change</category><category>Global warming</category><category>Industry</category><dc:creator>Mike Colagrossi</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20464974/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/renewable-energy-dirty-mining</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Why, in India, female farmers are paying to become 'womb-less'</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/R3A5XXCgY24/india-wombless-farmers</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20478716/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the Beed District of the Indian state Maharashtra, a disturbing number of women are getting their wombs removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The majority of these women work as sugar-cane cutters, employed by and in debt to contractors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In order to pay back their debt and avoid fines, many women opt to pay for a hysterectomy rather than miss work due to their periods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Beed district of the Indian state of Maharashtra, women are undergoing an extreme procedure in the name of boosting their productivity. In order to ensure that they don't miss any days at work, many women are paying doctors to remove their wombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one village, called Vanjarwadi, half of all the women have had hysterectomies. According to India's Health Minister &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/panel-to-probe-high-number-of-hysterectomy-cases-in-beed-maharashtra-health-minister-119061900853_1.html" target="_blank"&gt;Eknath Shinde&lt;/a&gt;, more than 4,500 women have had hysterectomies in the Beed District over the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achyut Borgaonkar, an organization that's been investigating this issue, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/why-half-the-women-in-maharashtras-beed-district-have-no-wombs/article26773974.ece" target="_blank"&gt;The Hindu Business Line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that "In the cane cutter community, menstrual periods are considered a problem and they think surgery is the only option to get rid of it. But this has a serious impact on the health of the women as they develop a hormonal imbalance, mental health issues, gain weight, etc. We observed that even young girls at the age of 25 have undergone this surgery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In debt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="SHAU421564670692" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="abd70" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDQ4MDQ3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NTEzNTIyMX0.bF6d6RjXP4NuPu46z1yplMyjQlKEIIQijfWB3x7I7JY/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=1116%2C634%2C405%2C769&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large reason for this trend is because of the nature of farm work in Beed. It is a drought-prone district whose primary industry product is sugar cane. Laborers only have a short window during cane-cutting season (October to March) to gather sugar cane and earn what may be their only income for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contractors hire couples as one unit, paying them an advance of around 1,500,000 rupees — about $2,175. The workers pay this advance back, and female workers earn about 202 rupees per day, or $2.93. If a day of work is missed, the contractors levies a 500-rupee fine ($7.26). Rather than miss a day of work due to their periods, many women simply opt to pay for an expensive, one-time surgery to remove their wombs. This can cost 35,000 rupees ($508), &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-health-slavery/missing-wombs-the-health-scandal-enslaving-families-in-rural-india-idUSKCN1SE007" target="_blank"&gt;or more&lt;/a&gt; — many woman take out additional loans to cover the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One female worker told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/indian-female-farmers-womb-boost-productivity-190723201905906.html" target="_blank"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that, "It was better to invest in operation at once than keep spending over medicines." The additional costs of regularly purchasing sanitary pads, too, can make the operation appear attractive, and non-profits that offer free sanitary pads are often understocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these costs, many contractors reportedly see women who still have their womb as less employable. Some even offer advances to women who intend to get the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Predatory clinics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This development has been good for private doctors, some of whom have begun to advise women to get the surgery, even if its unnecessary. Subha Sri, who heads a coalition of health charities, investigated private doctors who were arbitrarily performing hysterectomies. "Doctors link all of it — their pelvic pain or lower back pain — to the uterus," he told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-health-slavery/missing-wombs-the-health-scandal-enslaving-families-in-rural-india-idUSKCN1SE007" target="_blank"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. "They are introducing health problems and often not treating women for what they had come for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the surgery isn't as effective as many believe. There are often post-surgery complications, which can lead to women going back to doctors for more treatment if they can afford it or suffering through their symptoms if they cannot. Often, this means that they cannot work — ostensibly the very reason they chose to get the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice preys on uneducated women, who have been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756367/#Sec9" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; to be the main recipients of hysterectomies. Many women in Beed are taken out of school after puberty so that they can begin working. This has a two-fold effect: Not only do these women know less about their rights and about the dangers of medically-unnecessary surgery, but they also lack the skills to work in other, less-predatory fields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate effect of this is wage slavery: These women are compelled to pay back their contractors and are coerced into removing their wombs in order to do so, which often merely reinforces the financial burden that perpetuates their exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/R3A5XXCgY24" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 14:13:33 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/india-wombless-farmers</guid><category>Work</category><category>Asia</category><category>Slavery</category><category>Poverty</category><category>Health care</category><category>Women</category><dc:creator>Matt Davis</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20478716/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/india-wombless-farmers</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Being and drunkenness: How to party like an existentialist</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/E1H7HhKOrBo/existentialism</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20386779/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existentialism has a reputation for being angst-ridden and gloomy mostly because of its emphasis on pondering the meaninglessness of existence, but two of the best-known existentialists knew how to have fun in the face of absurdity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre spent a lot of time partying: talking, drinking, dancing, laughing, loving and listening to music with friends, and this was an aspect of their philosophical stance on life. They weren't just philosophers who happened to enjoy parties, either – the parties were an expression of their philosophy of seizing life, and for them there were authentic and inauthentic ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For de Beauvoir in particular, philosophy was to be lived vivaciously, and partying was bound up with her urge to live fully and freely, not to hold herself back from all that life had to offer. She wrote that sometimes she does 'everything a little too crazily … But that is my way. I have rather not to do the things at all as doing them mildly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sartre loved the imaginative playfulness that alcohol facilitated: 'I liked having confused, vaguely questioning ideas that then fell apart.' Too much seriousness hardens the world, pinning it down with rules, they felt, suffocating freedom and creativity. Taking parties too seriously dissipates their effervescence. Seriousness flattens them into institutions, hollow shams of gratuitously flaunted wealth and materialism, pathetic pleas for acknowledgement through the gazes of others, or hedonistic indulgences in sordid ephemeral pleasures that serve only to distract participants from their stagnating lives. A serious party neglects the underlying virtues of playfulness and generosity that make a party authentic. De Beauvoir tried smoking joints but, no matter how hard she inhaled, she remained firmly planted to the ground. She and Sartre self-medicated with amphetamines to remedy hangovers, heartbreaks and writers' blocks. Sartre tripped on psychedelics for academic purposes: he took mescaline to inform his research on hallucinations. But alcohol would always be their drug of choice for partying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A party isn't a party without others, of course, and, although Sartre is renowned for his line 'Hell is – other people!' in &lt;em&gt;No Exit&lt;/em&gt; (1944), that was far from the whole story for him: both he and de Beauvoir discovered themselves in their relations with other people. 'In songs, laughter, dances, eroticism, and drunkenness,' de Beauvoir writes in &lt;em&gt;The Ethics of Ambiguity&lt;/em&gt; (1947), 'one seeks both an exaltation of the moment and a complicity with other men.' For her, complicity and reciprocity are the foundation of ethical relationships because other people provide the context of our lives. And because our world is infused with the meanings that other people are giving it, our existence can be revealed only in communication with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parties can cultivate our connections to others, bring meaning to one another's lives, and reveal the world with them. They can also confirm one another's existences, serving as a reminder to friends that they matter, and that one matters to one's friends. Moreover, the warmth and laughter that authentic partying sparks can help people cope with the chaos of life. De Beauvoir wrote of her wartime parties in occupied Paris: they saved up food stamps and then binged on food, fun and alcohol. They danced, sang, played music and improvised. The artist Dora Maar mimed bullfights, Sartre mimed orchestra-conducting in a cupboard, and Albert Camus banged on saucepan lids as if in a marching band. De Beauvoir wrote that: 'We merely wanted to snatch a few nuggets of sheer joy from this confusion and intoxicate ourselves with their brightness, in defiance of the disenchantments that lay ahead.' These were small acts of rebellion in the face of real fears for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics of de Beauvoir and Sartre would try to discredit them with accusations of inspiring orgies, encouraging hedonism, and being what the philosopher Julia Kristeva in 2016 called 'libertarian terrorists' who formed a 'shock commando unit' to seduce their sexual victims. Nevertheless, they weren't encouraging all-out hedonism, because they didn't value personal pleasure over responsibility. For de Beauvoir, there's nothing philosophically wrong with having orgies, it's the same as with any other aspect of life: it matters how you approach the situation. If a person, she wrote, 'brings his entire self to every situation, there can be no such thing as a "base occasion"'. And it's true that de Beauvoir and Sartre had many lovers, but casual sex wasn't part of their repertoire. They thought that promiscuity was a trivial use of freedom and, instead, wanted intense love affairs and friendships. (Nevertheless, people were hurt in these relationships, and although de Beauvoir acknowledged responsibility for this, neither she nor Sartre were ever held morally &lt;em&gt;accountable&lt;/em&gt; by others in any meaningful way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejecting social norms is a process of destruction: refusing to be defined primarily by what others think you should be, how you are supposed to act, and the choices you are supposed to make. Partying can involve a similar act of destroying such expectations, as well as expending time, money, food, drink and brain cells. Some might call this a waste, but what are we saving ourselves for? A good life isn't always a long one, and a long life isn't necessarily a happy or fulfilled one. Rather, what's important is to embrace life passionately. Existence is a process of spending ourselves, and sometimes requires leaving our former selves behind to create ourselves anew, thrusting forward into the future, disclosing our being into new realms. We do this by opening ourselves to, and playing with, possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet partying like an existentialist also calls for caution. While it can be a reprieve from a world full of despair and distractions, it's bad faith to use it as a means to escape one's situation. Running away from life or succumbing to peer pressure reduces oneself to what de Beauvoir called an absurd 'palpitation'. For partying to be authentic, it must be freely and actively chosen, done purposefully, and in a way that reflects one's values. Furthermore, too much partying can become exhausting and monotonous when it siphons off the zest from life and becomes a repetitive and meaningless series of encounters, which is why existentialist parties tended to be only occasional events. Camus would ask de Beauvoir if it's possible to party as hard as they did and still work. De Beauvoir replied no. To avoid stagnation, she thought that existence 'must be immediately engaged in a new undertaking, it must dash off toward the future'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authentic existential partying, then, requires a kind of self-mastery: to hold oneself in the tension between freedom and responsibility, playfulness and seriousness, and to nurture our connections without denying our situations. It encourages us to create our own links with the world, on our own terms, vigilantly detaching ourselves from internal chains, including habits or dependencies such as alcoholism. Such partying also incites us to challenge external chains, such as institutional restrictions, and so the stubborn insistence on living life as one chooses and in ways that strengthen our bonds to one another can be an act of revolt. An existential approach to partying recognises that although life can be menacing, it can and should be enjoyable, and being with others in the playful mode of partying can help us bear the darkness through a shared sense of euphoria, harmony and hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both de Beauvoir and Sartre spent their rich lives embracing new undertakings, but took their whiskey and vodka bottles with them. This led to serious health problems, including cirrhosis, but they never regretted their partying or drinking, and by their own philosophy, there is no reason they should have done. They chose it freely, did it on their own terms, and took responsibility for the consequences. That's what partying like an existentialist is all about.&lt;img alt="Aeon counter – do not remove" src="https://metrics.aeon.co/count/87ec45c2-51d3-430c-a184-11d78f21d02e.gif"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was originally published at &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/?utm_campaign=republished-article" target="_blank"&gt;Aeon&lt;/a&gt; and has been republished under Creative Commons.

	The media is fascinated by autonomous vehicles (AVs), in particular their safety and when or if they will arrive en masse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bigger and more important question is how AVs will work together as fleets and whether they work with public transport to move more people with fewer vehicles to solve our urban congestion and pollution challenges.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	There is growing consensus that while personal electric AVs may improve air quality, they will only make traffic worse in cities, because replacing private autos one-for-one will not address congestion; and people may be so comfortable in their AV pods that they won't mind sitting in traffic for hours. For the latter reason, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/mobility_-driverless-vehicles-may-lead-to-more-congestion-in-cities/45016308" target="_blank"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that cities prohibit the use of personal AVs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	What is crucial is that AVs are electric, shared and work with public transport; and that cities invest in the infrastructure and technology necessary to support a connected, multi-modal transit network that includes shared electric AVs that can replace or augment less efficient traditional bus lines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/15878/index-scores-on-the-level-of-preparedness-for-driverless-cars/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://assets.weforum.org/editor/ExJkRuLedoBeAhKNte_hBLxPNqZV27rPi_sNxvj9vC0.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The city as app store&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft are adding public transit to their apps to help people plan door-to-door trips, becoming Mobility as a Service (MaaS) aggregators. But this is backwards – public transit apps should add Uber and Lyft and the robotaxis of the future into their marketplaces. "There's nothing precluding commercial MaaS operators from favouring their own solutions; public transportation could very well be sidelined," urban planners at San Francisco's &lt;a href="https://www.spur.org/news/2018-04-25/why-we-can-t-leave-transportation-apps-private-sector" target="_blank"&gt;SPUR&lt;/a&gt; have warned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Los Angeles Department of Transportation General Manager &lt;a href="https://medium.com/bestmile/the-city-as-a-platform-how-cities-and-new-mobility-services-can-work-together-c62e57827cd2" target="_blank"&gt;Saleta Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; has put it this way: cities should act like "app stores" for mobility services. "The way Google and Apple invite innovation on their platforms is that they have terms and services that the companies agree to and then they can sell their products in the app store," she said at last year's CoMotion LA event. "As soon as they violate those terms and conditions, they are out of the app store."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This approach may rankle some who hope that electric AVs will replace what they see as inefficient, subsidised public transport with profitable, private alternatives. Though people often complain that public transportation loses money and is a drag on government budgets, looking at it as for-profit business misses much of the value public transport brings to communities and overlooks the costs of auto-centric mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of public transit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The capital and operational costs associated with public transit should be viewed as an investment in economic development rather than a simple business cost. The &lt;a href="https://www.uitp.org/news/monthly-focus-economic-impact-public-transport" target="_blank"&gt;Union Internationale des Transports Publics&lt;/a&gt; (UITP), the world's largest association of public transportation agencies, points out that "investment in public transport sparks a chain reaction in economic activity up to three or four times the initial investment".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It is important to remember that transportation, public or private, is rarely an end in itself. It is a means to another goal, for individuals to get to work, for example, and for employers to have wider access to workers. The benefits of accessible public transportation are widespread, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.apta.com/news-publications/public-transportation-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;American Public Transportation Association&lt;/a&gt; (APTA):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every dollar invested in public transit generates $4 in economic returns;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every $10 million in capital investment in public transportation yields $30 million in increased business;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Every $10 million in operating investment yields $32 million in increased business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/livability/fact_sheets/transandhousing.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;In the US, households living in auto-dependent locations spend as much as 25% of their income on transportation&lt;/a&gt;. A car that breaks down can mean the loss of a job. Reliable public transit lowers the cost of living for people with easy access to it, saving users more than $10,000 per year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Costs of auto-centric cities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The UITP also points out that "while large-scale public transport investment projects are undoubtedly expensive, they are actually significantly less expensive than the direct cost of congestion, which can seriously harm the cities' competitiveness, affecting travel time reliability and business productivity."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Let's look at some of the negative economic and social impacts of private autos and congestion and pollution in cities:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1.25 million deaths and 20-50 million injuries from auto accidents each year (mostly due to human error) costing &lt;a href="https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;$518 billion globally&lt;/a&gt; or 1-2% of GDP for most nations;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some 385,000 people die prematurely each year from air pollution caused by vehicle emissions;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lack of public transportation is a major obstacle to employment in many regions – Europe already spends 1.4% of GDP on unemployment benefits;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Commuters spend 100-200 hours per year in traffic, that's as much as five 40-hour weeks of lost productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will AVs help or hurt cities?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Multiple studies have been published sowing the seeds of doubt about the ability of AVs to improve congestion. University of &lt;a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/01/millardball-vehicles.html" target="_blank"&gt;California at Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt; researcher Adam Millard-Ball studied traffic in San Francisco and found that AVs could double traffic because it will be far less expensive for vehicles to cruise or return home than to park in the city centre. Researchers at ETH Zurich and the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-autonomous-vehicles-wont-reduce-our-dependence-on-cars-in-cities-107608" target="_blank"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; came to similar conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Many point to the impact that ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have had on congestion and pollution as negative examples of what private AVs could do to cities. While promising to reduce traffic and emissions, the services are responsible for &lt;a href="http://www.schallerconsult.com/rideservices/automobility.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;5.7 billion miles&lt;/a&gt; added to US city streets, for example, and travel 2.8 miles empty for every mile that they carry a passenger. Most of those miles are used by people that otherwise would have used public transport.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A shared future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, research shows that shared electric AVs could reduce traffic and ride times. Integration with public transport is critical to achieving these benefits. Shared AVs "combined with high-capacity public transport could remove 9 out of every 10 cars in a mid-sized European city," according to the &lt;a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/15cpb_self-drivingcars.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;International Transport Forum&lt;/a&gt; (ITU). &lt;a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/15cpb_self-drivingcars.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;The corresponding reduction in traffic could reduce the time taken by these shared vehicles to complete all trips by as much as 30%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making cities work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html" target="_blank"&gt;More than 50% of the world's population live in major metropolitan areas&lt;/a&gt; and more people are coming: by 2050, that number is expected to near 70% percent. These cities are the economic engines of the world. According to the consulting firm &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/urbanization/urban-world-mapping-the-economic-power-of-cities" target="_blank"&gt;McKinsey&lt;/a&gt;, "Six hundred cities – the City 600 – are projected to generate more than 60% of global growth to 2025."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities are already short on roads and housing. In order to accommodate growth and support business and commerce, urban transportation will need to get smarter. New public and private transportation services including autonomous ones can play an important role in enabling smarter mobility but getting there will require more investment in urban transit, not less. In addition to reducing congestion, the ITU found that a combined shared AV/high-capacity public transport network can reduce off-street parking needs by 80%, "generating new opportunities for alternative uses of this valuable space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cities are to serve as an app store for new mobility services, they will need the support of corresponding technology platforms that enable public and private operators to work together. "There is no reason why current public transport operators or taxi companies could not take an active role in delivering these services," ITU's report says. "Governance of transport services, including concession rules and arrangements, will have to adapt." This will no doubt include limiting the number of AV services that can be operated to balance supply and demand and to avoid the overloading of vehicles seen with today's peer-to-peer ride-hailing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Public good&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public transportation has a mandate that private companies don't: to make safe, affordable transit available to all residents regardless of age, income, ability and location. Cities will need leverage to enforce policies that serve all stakeholders so that all can thrive. While public transit operators may never turn a profit in the traditional sense that we use to evaluate private businesses, the direct and indirect economic benefits that their services deliver to residents and businesses are far greater than the capital and operational costs involved. AVs and services will need to be a part of the mix public transport offers becoming, as the ITU notes, "a new form of low capacity, high quality public transport."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reprinted with permission of the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/" target="_blank"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;.

Much of the tech seems to be adding even more stress, designed to both help us cope and entrap us further in the hectic demands of modern life. But what if you could start from scratch and create the kind of society where the best of technology would utilize the best ideas in robotics, healthcare, energy generation and government? Such is the utopian promise of the $500 billion futuristic city-state &lt;strong&gt;Neom&lt;/strong&gt;, being built in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"This is the blank page you need to write humanity's next chapter," promises the commercial for the city on the &lt;a href="https://www.neom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Neom homepage. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American consultants, hired by the city's developers came up with a 2,300 page proposal that wants to make Neom largely run by robots, with eye-catchy features based in part on tech that doesn't yet exist. Some of the fun things the city would have are flying taxis, glow-in-the-dark sand, cloud seeding to make it rain in the desert, robotic maids, MMA-style robot cage fights, and, of course, a Jurassic-Park-like island, replete with robot dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, most curious of all, Neom would have a gigantic artificial moon, made from a fleet of drones, which would not only light up every night, but could live-stream images straight from outer space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run on wind and solar energy, the city would also be a state-of-the-art center for technological and medical innovation, spearheading genetic engineering efforts to improve the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a beacon of progress, where many citizens would work in startups while being educated in innovative ways like &lt;em&gt;holographic faculties&lt;/em&gt;, would make the economy of Neom robust. In fact, it would have "the highest GDP per capita," according to the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Red Sea area where Neom will be built:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="UJB8SJ1564670813" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="cc051" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0Nzg2MS85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjUzNTQ0NTB9.GHYdt61hwlazCB8hhIB00ObbUuA3TzO40-PVe_d2HJA/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Red Sea area where Neom will be built:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="UIPVIT1564670813" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="da276" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0NzgxNy85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjQ5NDUzMDJ9.QYun4FSsqrUQRKIalI8LkXa65rvydknPTt3Em1FIgmU/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Red Sea area where Neom will be built:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="XQ5AZO1564670813" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="f72e3" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0NzgyMS85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjUzNTg2NzJ9.5NYE8OAxPSPJeUCUpX2fKYdBr8o5W0xnqLu_zbi7nf4/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neom is the shortened version of the Latin-Arabic term &lt;strong&gt;"Neo-Mustaqbal", &lt;/strong&gt;which means "new future." How far in the future? The project's first phase is already complete and the second phase will be announced by the year's end, recently promised Neom's CEO &lt;strong&gt;Nadhmi Al-Nasr &lt;/strong&gt;at the site of the city's first commercial airport Gayal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first phase involved the conceptualizing of the economic, funding and development plans for Neom. Actual construction also began on the airport and a resort. Phase two should result in fleshing out further details of "what Neom is going to be," Al-Nasr &lt;a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/construction/424565-first-phase-of-saudi-arabias-8bn-giga-project-neom-complete" target="_blank"&gt;stated to Arab News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Neom is all about things that are necessarily future-oriented and visionary," Al-Nasr &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-princes-500-billion-desert-dream-flying-cars-robot-dinosaurs-and-a-giant-artificial-moon-11564097568" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "So we are talking about technology that is cutting edge and beyond—and in some cases still in development and maybe theoretical."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Saudi Arabia Plans Futuristic City, "Neom" (Full Promotional Video)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="LPHLYD1564670813" style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" lazy-loadable="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N53DzL3_BHA?rel=0?enablejsapi=1" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was introduced in 2017 by &lt;strong&gt;Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.&lt;/strong&gt; It is planned to include &lt;strong&gt;450km &lt;/strong&gt;of Red Sea coastline, which would make it a major vacation destination – 8 hours away flying from anywhere in the world, as calculated the consultants. Neom will span a total area of &lt;strong&gt;26,500 square km&lt;/strong&gt; across three countries, including territory from North-Western Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city itself will be "the world's first independent international zone," presents its &lt;a href="https://www.neom.com/content/pdfs/NEOM-Faqs-en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;marketing literature.&lt;/a&gt; How independent it will actually be remains to be seen. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia set up a "special authority," chaired by the Crown Prince himself, to supervise the development of the project. Once its built, the zone will be managed via a "regulatory framework that will adopt world-class investment laws to support residents and targeted economic sectors," declares its &lt;a href="https://www.neom.com/content/pdfs/NEOM-Faqs-en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;, which also purports the city-state will have an "autonomous judicial system." Its laws, enforced by city-wide automation and tracking of its citizens, would be independent of Saudi Arabia's, created by a slate of both local and foreign investors "in accordance with international best practice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're still wondering if the megacity would be subject to the Muslim Kingdom's societal practices, Neom &lt;a href="https://www.neom.com/content/pdfs/NEOM-Faqs-en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; it will utilize the best practices from around the world that can improve the lives of its residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality may be quite different, however, as the Wall Street Journal's &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-princes-500-billion-desert-dream-flying-cars-robot-dinosaurs-and-a-giant-artificial-moon-11564097568" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the documents from the consultants found that the judges of Neom would be reporting directly to the king, while Sharia law would still be the law of the land. The one big exception might be alcohol, which supposedly would be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long will the project take? The overall timeline estimates 7-10 years from now. The plan certainly has its detractors and possible human-rights issues, like the plan for the forced relocation of more than 20,000 people indigenous to the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/vP64kt_P2_U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 21:00:11 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/neom-megacity-with-own-moon-dinosaurs-robots</guid><category>Alternative energy</category><category>Robots</category><category>Computers</category><category>Saudi arabia</category><category>Future</category><category>Government</category><category>Moon</category><category>Urban planning</category><category>Solar energy</category><category>Health</category><dc:creator>Paul Ratner</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20347835/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/neom-megacity-with-own-moon-dinosaurs-robots</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>How does your productivity stack up?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/ZW9AduqEWf0/how-productive-are-you</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20347755/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know that person who always seems to be ahead of their deadlines, despite being swamped? Do you look at them with envy and wonder how they do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regardless of location, industry, or occupation, productivity is a challenge faced by every professional," says &lt;a href="https://executive.mit.edu/openenrollment/program/maximizing-your-personal-productivity/#faculty" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Pozen&lt;/a&gt;, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his ongoing research and aided by MIT undergraduate Kevin Downey, Pozen surveyed 20,000 self-selected individuals in management from six continents to learn why some people are more productive than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey tool, dubbed the Pozen Productivity Rating, consists of 21 questions divided into seven categories: planning your schedule, developing daily routines, coping with your messages, getting a lot done, improving your communication skills, running effective meetings, and delegating to others. These particular habits and skills are core to Pozen's MIT Sloan Executive Education program, &lt;a href="https://executive.mit.edu/openenrollment/program/maximizing-your-personal-productivity/" target="_blank"&gt;Maximizing Your Productivity: How to Become an Efficient and Effective Executive&lt;/a&gt;, and his bestselling book, "&lt;a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/extreme-productivity-robert-c-pozen/1110914246/2687365873364?st=PLA&amp;sid=BNB_ADL+Marketplace+Generic+New+Books+-+Desktop+Medium&amp;sourceId=PLAGoNA&amp;dpid=tdtve346c&amp;2sid=Google_c&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk663lIrV4QIVTIezCh3O5wgsEAQYAiABEgKnr_D_BwE" target="_blank" title="(opens new window)"&gt;Extreme Productivity: Boost Your Results, Reduce Your Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After cleaning up the data, Pozen and Downey obtained a complete set of answers from 19,957 respondents. Roughly half were residents of North America; another 21 percent were residents of Europe, and 19 percent were residents of Asia. The remaining 10 percent included residents of Australia, South America, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified the groups of people with the highest productivity ratings and found that professionals with the highest scores tended to do well on the same clusters of habits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;They planned their work based on their top priorities and then acted with a definite objective;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;they developed effective techniques for managing a high volume of information and tasks; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;they understood the needs of their colleagues, enabling short meetings, responsive communications, and clear directions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were also interesting when parsed by the demographics of the survey participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geographically, the average productivity score for respondents from North America was in the middle of the pack, even though Americans tend to work longer hours. In fact, the North American score was significantly lower than the average productivity scores for respondents from Europe, Asia, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age and seniority were highly correlated with personal productivity — older and more senior professionals recorded higher scores than younger and more junior colleagues. Habits of these more senior respondents included developing routines for low-value activities, managing message flow, running effective meetings, and delegating tasks to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall productivity scores of male and female professionals were almost the same, there were some noteworthy differences in how women and men managed to be so productive. For example, women tended to score particularly high when it came to running effective meetings — keeping meetings to less than 90 minutes and finishing with an agreement of next steps. By contrast, men did particularly well at coping with high message volume — not looking at their emails too frequently and skipping over the messages of low value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Coping with your daily flood of messages&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's clear that the ability to deal with inbox overload is key to productivity, how that's accomplished may be less clear to many of us who shudder at our continuous backlog of emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all have so much small stuff, like email, that overwhelms us, and we wind up dedicating precious time to it," says Pozen. "Most of us look at email every three to five minutes. Instead, look every hour or two, and when you do look, look only at subject matter and sender, and essentially skip over 60-80 percent of it, because most emails you get aren't very useful." Pozen also encourages answering important emails immediately instead of flagging them and then finding them again later (or forgetting altogether), as well as flagging important contacts and making ample use of email filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Pozen stresses that managing incoming emails, while an important skill, needs to be paired with other, more big-picture habits in order to be effective, such as defining your highest priorities. He warns that without a specific set of goals to pursue — both personal and professional — many ambitious people devote insufficient time to activities that actually support their top goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;More tips for maximizing your productivity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to become more productive, try developing the "habit clusters" demonstrated in Pozen's survey results and possessed by the most productive professionals. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focusing on your primary objectives: Every night, revise your next day's schedule to stress your top priorities. Decide your purpose for reading any lengthy material, before you start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing your work overload: Skip over 50-80 percent of your emails based on the sender and the subject. Break large projects into small steps — and start with step one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supporting your colleagues: Limit any meeting to 90 minutes or less and end each meeting with clearly defined next steps. Agree on success metrics with your team.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pozen's survey tool is &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2018/08/assessment-how-productive-are-you" target="_blank"&gt;still available online&lt;/a&gt;. Those completing it will receive a feedback report offering practical tips for improving productivity.

	&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;We're mid-way through summer, but if you work full-time, you may not be feeling the season's full benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Spending 40+ hours a week in a seasonless office under fluorescent lighting and frigid A/C can leave even the most indoorsy of us feeling &lt;a href="https://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/articles/10.5334/jcr.153/" target="_blank"&gt;restless&lt;/a&gt;, like we're missing out on all the sunshine until the weekend.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Exposure to daylight is a known &lt;a href="https://time.com/4888327/why-sunlight-is-so-good-for-you/" target="_blank"&gt;mood-booster&lt;/a&gt; and plays an important role in regulating our &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12568247" target="_blank"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, or our sleep-wake cycle, and the earlier sunrises and later sunsets of summer mean there's more sunshine to go around. But many workers feel sun-deprived: One &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070529005099/en/Sunny-Skies-High-Temperatures-Employees-Suffering-Seasonal#.VZQVokvhzNO" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from The Workforce Institute and Kronos Incorporated found that as many as 39 percent of people with full-time jobs admit to having taken a "sick" day to instead enjoy the summer weather.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A day job doesn't have to be devoid of daylight. Try mixing up your workday with these Thrive &lt;a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/microsteps-big-idea-too-small-to-fail-healthy-habits-willpower/" target="_blank"&gt;Microsteps&lt;/a&gt; for beating the summer slump and boosting your mood and performance through Labor Day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Schedule a walking meeting, or take a call outdoors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You don't have to set your busy workload aside to enjoy a change of scenery. Instead of booking a conference room per usual for an upcoming meeting, or a phone booth for a call, take it outside. Pick a short, quiet path for a walking meeting or a phone call. Your colleagues will appreciate the break from routine, and you may find that simply stepping out of our usual environment takes your conversations in new and exciting directions. When you return to your desk you'll feel refreshed and ready to focus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Take a lunchtime stroll, even if you brown-bagged your meal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch is an ideal time to head out to grab a bite or a midday coffee or tea, but you don't need to have a destination in mind — or even spend any money — to take advantage of this natural pause point in the workday. Even if you brought your lunch to the office or had an on-site team meal, pop outside for a short walk, or join some co-workers on their food run. Just 20-30 minutes outside, even in a city setting, has been found to lower our levels of cortisol, known as the stress hormone, according to one recent &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00722/full" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Michigan in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Work near a window for creative inspiration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot on your plate and can't step away from your desk, "Try shifting the orientation of your desk to face the window, so you can look at nature," Nevin Harper, Ph.D., professor at the University of Victoria and co-author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Based-Therapy-Practitioners-Outdoors-Children/dp/0865719136/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=nature+outdoors+psychology+book&amp;qid=1551384403&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature-Based Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/intentional-walk-workday-productive-creative-nature-outdoors-benefits-work/" target="_blank"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; to Thrive. This simple seating change can increase your daylight exposure without even setting foot outside the office. One &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031400/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that employees who sat in proximity to a window were more physically active and slept longer, and reported higher quality sleep overall than those whose workstations were far from windows or in windowless offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reprinted with permission of &lt;a href="https://thriveglobal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Thrive Global&lt;/a&gt;.

The now-famous pyramid of increasingly sophisticated needs and desires, culminating in &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/10-characteristics-of-self-actualized-people" target="_self"&gt;self-actualization&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/robby-berman/the-missing-apex-of-maslows-hierarchy-could-save-us-all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;self-transcendence&lt;/a&gt;, has taken root in our collective minds, dominating wellness blogs, business seminars, and self-improvement books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hierarchy of needs is just &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;way to think of human development. This said, relatively few people have heard of Kazimierz Dąbrowski's competing &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1965-06298-000" target="_blank"&gt;theory of positive disintegration&lt;/a&gt;. What's the difference between the two, and what are their respective merits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The theory of positive disintegration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="PCOAZ81564670647" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="88b33" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0NzUzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NDgyMzk1NH0.gGNfaig9kiGpQuJ434BiUK46Dsov1xZnMjm_18uFkfk/img.jpg?width=1200&amp;coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C0&amp;height=600"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simple way to characterize the difference between the two models is that Maslow focused more on the carrot, and Dąbrowski focused more on the stick. In Maslow's hierarchy of needs, people are driven to satisfy the need of whichever level they find themselves on the pyramid: the need to eat, the need to feel loved, the need to realize their full potential, and so on. Dąbrowski, on the other hand, believed that personal crises, anxieties, and psychological tension are necessary for an individual to &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37817091/1The_organized_Multilevel_Disintegration_as_an_Emerging_Order.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Organized_Multilevel_Disintegration.pdf&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190728%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20190728T134753Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=896066c832029984dec8b9a6d8b739d7fd08a698d6b9665546c1df23c21ed686" target="_blank"&gt;transform themselves&lt;/a&gt; and develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we can dive into Dąbrowski's model, understanding more about Dąbrowski's life may be helpful. His life was one of constant turmoil and crises, largely because he grew up in Poland during the span between the &lt;a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26692/Dissertation.pdf?sequence=2" target="_blank"&gt;two World Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Dąbrowski was jailed by both the Nazis and the Communists, and, as a member of both the intelligentsia and psychiatry in general, he was at significant risk under the Nazi regime. Dąbrowski hid his mentally ill patients, working underground in order to spare them from the Nazis purification programs. He was active in the resistance effort, and during his imprisonment, Dąbrowski was subjected to torture and starvation. As such, crisis, conflict, and suffering came to inform a great deal of his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His model of human development can be divided into five levels. The first level, called primary integration, is where he believed the majority of humanity resided. Here, human beings are guided by two factors: instinct and social conventions. Those who rely primarily on instinct and biological imperatives often act selfishly, advancing their own interests over those of others. Dąbrowski argued that many criminals and psychopaths operate at this level. The rest of humanity operates according to social conventions, accepting social mores without critically examining them. In a benevolent society, this mindset doesn't cause any real harm; the moral code the society provides may indeed be moral. However, in a less enlightened society, the majority of people will follow convention and commit heinous acts if it is expected of them. As an example, consider the number of Nazi soldiers who were "just following orders." People at this first level feel that all their behavior is good and correct, and so they do not experience much internal turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this can be interrupted by a crisis, launching an individual into the second level: unilateral disintegration. Moments of major change, such as adolescence, can bring this about. At this moment, an individual is faced with irreconcilable choices that apparently conflict with the social conventions or biological impulses that guided their behavior during the first level. Many people reach this stage, tinctured by psychological turmoil, only to fall back to the first level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third level is called multilevel disintegration. Here, rather than simply conflicting with the norms that an individual was raised with, the individual begins to see a higher, better alternative. They can see an ideal and recognize that their own behavior falls short of it. As a result, they begin to scrutinize and reconstruct themselves to get closer to that higher, more ideal way of being. Again, people can fall back to previous levels here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the fourth level, called directed multilevel disintegration, the individual isn't just responding to crises — they're actively rooting out how their behavior conflicts with their higher ideal. Each "default" view they had of life is examined, and if it meets their newly developing standards, the perspective or behavior is retained. If it doesn't, the individual reshapes that perspective or behavior to better match the way they think it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to the cherry on top, the equivalent of Maslow's self-actualization: secondary integration. Here, a person's values and identity are the result of deliberate, conscious choice. They've looked at who they want to be and how that contrasts with what their society wanted them to be or how their instincts told them to act and have established a comprehensive system of morals. Just as there is little internal conflict at level 1, so too is there little internal conflict at level 5. Only this lack of turmoil happens for very different reasons — rather than failing to acknowledge the possibility of any higher standard than what society presents, an individual who has undergone secondary integration has established a moral code that tells them unequivocally how to behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dąbrowski didn't think that everyone had the potential to reach secondary integration. He argued that some people had more "developmental potential" than others. This concept has three parts to it: First, individuals with high overexcitability have more developmental potential. Dąbrowski described this as a greater sensitivity to life, a heightened experience of stimuli, and a "&lt;a href="http://positivedisintegration.com/brief.htm" target="_blank"&gt;tragic gift&lt;/a&gt;." The more overexcitable somebody is, the more likely they are to experience crises and suffering, but these crises are necessary for growth. Then, there's talents and skills, whose contribution to personal growth is fairly self-evident. Finally, there's a third factor: the innate, autonomous drive to growth that some people exhibit. Many are content with where and who they are, while others seem driven to advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What's the difference?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that there are some pretty major differences between Dąbrowski and Maslow. They were friends and colleagues, but each had a very different approach to thinking about human development. One major difference is that Maslow's hierarchy of needs doesn't, in modern usage, focus on transformation so much. Somebody who has achieved self-actualization has realized their whole self, including those lower modes of thinking and behaving that Dąbrowski described at level 1 of his model. In contrast, the theory of positive disintegration requires some things to disintegrate before somebody can truly realize their potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maslow's model also implies that people are naturally inclined toward self-actualization. As each lower need is met, people are motivated to pursue the next level of the pyramid. Once you have food and water, then you'll look for shelter and safety. Once you're safe, then you'll look for belonging and love. Once you have these, you'll build your self-esteem. Once you've done that, you can become self-actualized. But Dąbrowski thinks that most people don't feel the need to become their idealized self. Most people are content to go with the flow and follow the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So which model is right? It's hard to say. Both are just formalizations of the very complicated matter of human experience. Perhaps we can't boil down interior transformation into levels and pyramids. These models might not be able to serve as roadmaps to enlightenment, but they can help us look at ourselves through different lenses and — hopefully — become better human beings in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/aFaYzNHcG2Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 14:26:18 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/self-actualization-vs-secondary-integration</guid><category>Motivation</category><category>Psychology</category><category>Pain</category><category>Emotions</category><category>Morality</category><category>Personal growth</category><dc:creator>Matt Davis</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20407813/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/self-actualization-vs-secondary-integration</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Elephants are now being hunted for their skin, being turned into 'ruby'-like jewelry</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bigthink/main/~3/oaUrR2n1WiI/elephant-skin-trade</link><description>&lt;img src="https://assets.rbl.ms/20347964/origin.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul class="ee-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the start of 2018, China banned all ivory products within its borders. As one of the largest markets for ivory, this represented a significant win for conservationists.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, just as the ivory trade declined, a new demand for elephant skin emerged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The skin is used in medicine and to make jewelry. What options are there for combating this dangerous new trend?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, the biggest threat to the largest land mammals on Earth, elephants, was the ivory trade. As demand for their tusks increased in modern times, the industry became a major — not to mention unsustainable — threat to their wild populations. Between 1979 and 1989, for instance, demand for ivory cut the African elephant population down from 1.3 million to &lt;a href="http://www.greatelephantcensus.com/background-on-conservation" target="_blank"&gt;600,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ivory trade took a serious blow in 1989, though, when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned international trade in African elephant ivory, a move that followed up the 1975 ban on trading Asian elephant ivory. Poaching continued to be an issue, particularly since there was still considerable demand in the Chinese market, where ivory was used in medicine and ornaments. But, in 2018, there was another bit of good news: China &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42532017" target="_blank"&gt;banned the trade&lt;/a&gt; of all ivory and ivory products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Out of the frying pan and into the fire&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was certainly a victory for conservationists, but it seems that elephants can't catch a break. Starting around 2014, Asian elephants have been poached for their skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://elephant-family.org/what-we-do/raising-awareness/in-the-news/press-releases/skinned_new_investigative_report" target="_blank"&gt;2018 report&lt;/a&gt; from Elephant Family, a U.K.-based non-profit, found that the main market for elephant skin was located in China, where it is primarily used for two purposes: It's ground down into a powder for use in traditional medicinal products, and it's shaped in polished beads for bracelets and necklaces. Belinda Stewart-Cox, the director of conservation at the non-profit Elephant Conservation Network, explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt;"If you look at [the beads], you think they look like garnets, rubies or some kind of red stone. But those subcutaneous layers [in the skin] include a lot of blood vessels, so there's a lot of blood in that. Those beads look ruby red because they contain blood." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="0OTATD1564670564" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ad3a3" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDM0Nzk4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU2NTI2OTM1N30.5iPpdz8JN7CrjtlyUVrvyX8KnQk-8wUMZPuB8-WayYQ/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=9%2C531%2C936%2C313&amp;height=700"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this trade is even more destructive than the ivory trade. First, it primarily targets Asian elephants, which were already more at risk than African elephants. Today, there are only about 50,000 wild Asian elephants left. In addition, ivory poaching could only target elephants who could grow tusks — among Asian elephants, adult males only grow tusks roughly 25 percent of the time — but skin poaching is &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/skin-poaching-asian-elephants-myanmar-blood-beads" target="_blank"&gt;indiscriminate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the innate tragedy of losing one of Earth's largest land mammals, it would be an ecological disaster if the Asian elephant were to go extinct. Asian elephants are sometimes referred to as the "&lt;a href="https://elephant-family.org/who-we-are/about-us" target="_blank"&gt;gardeners of the forest&lt;/a&gt;," as they eat plants that would otherwise grow wild, they create paths through the forest for other animals to move through and for new plant life to grow in, and they &lt;a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Elephas_maximus/#ecosystem_roles" target="_blank"&gt;distribute seeds&lt;/a&gt; through their dung, which also has the added benefit of fertilizing the soil and providing homes and nutrients for a variety of insect species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is not easy for elephants to recover from a major blow to their population. As a large species, elephants do not have many offspring, and the gestational period for one elephant is around 22 months. And while ivory poaching mainly targeted the males, now female elephants are also viable targets for poachers, further hampering these animals' ability to bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conservation efforts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian elephants are listed in &lt;a href="https://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Appendix I of CITES&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that all products derived from these elephants is prohibited except for non-commercial purposes, like scientific research. Despite this, however, China's State Forestry Administration is &lt;a href="https://www.elephant-family.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Elephant-Family-Skin-Report-2018.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;issuing licenses&lt;/a&gt; for the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products containing elephant skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, China's ban on the ivory trade indicates that similar regulation can be implemented and work in the future. After significant public support, notably including Chinese basketball star Yao Ming, China implemented its ban on the ivory trade at the start of 2018. A &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/wildlife-watch-news-ivory-demand-reduction-china-ban/" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of Chinese individuals indicated that after the ban came into effect, 72 percent of Chinese respondents would not buy ivory, compared to 50 percent when the poll was conducted the year prior, before the ban was applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of non-profits are working to raise awareness of this issue and to bring it to the attention of international bodies, such as CITES. Elephant Family, for example, presented its 2018 report to CITES, gaining approval from the European Union and the U.S. for amendments, such as requiring &lt;a href="https://elephant-family.org/what-we-do/raising-awareness/in-the-news/press-releases/victory-at-cites" target="_blank"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into illegal trade and implementation reporting. The World Wildlife Fund, too, is &lt;a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/supporters-help-wwf-launch-emergency-plan-to-stop-myanmar-s-elephant-poaching-crisis" target="_blank"&gt;equipping and training rangers&lt;/a&gt; to stop poaching in Myanmar, where this crisis is particularly dire. With any luck and with greater public awareness and engagement, we can drive poaching, rather than elephants, to extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/oaUrR2n1WiI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2019 13:26:36 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/elephant-skin-trade</guid><category>Markets</category><category>Pharmaceuticals</category><category>Policy</category><category>Sustainability</category><category>Trafficking</category><category>China</category><dc:creator>Matt Davis</dc:creator><media:content url="https://assets.rbl.ms/20347964/980x.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/elephant-skin-trade</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Is panpsychism accurate?

For instance, panpsychism may be due for an update: panprotopsychism, a view that says as these fundamental ingredients combine, they give rise to conscious experience and that those fundamental ingredients are "quasimental."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div class="rm-shortcode amazon-assets-widget" contenteditable="false" data-rm-shortcode-id="FC3E0F1564307811"&gt;

Georgetown Law researchers and reporters from the Washington Post found out that FBI and ICE investigators have been scanning hundreds of millions of photos from state DMVs to use in facial recognition software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This treasure trove of data is utilized frequently to look for suspects in "low-level" crimes. The FBI, apparently, makes about &lt;strong&gt;4,000&lt;/strong&gt; facial recognition searches every month. In total, the agency has access to &lt;strong&gt;641 million &lt;/strong&gt;face photos across various databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a practice currently involves &lt;strong&gt;21 states,&lt;/strong&gt; including the populous Pennsylvania and Texas. While there are rules set up for such search requests to be linked to active investigations, they are not always strict or followed. This leads to a lack of accountability or clarity in who is being looked at, whether there are false positives, and if privacy concerns are being addressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="CC73U71564680445" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="61ea4" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDMxNTY2NS85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjQ3Njc1MDR9.g3vQqVrk8DN43cNGj1iPDQcJFEbERQQDPHD0zNTKgIk/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clare Garvie&lt;/strong&gt;, a senior associate with the Georgetown Law center who headed the research, called it an"insane breach of trust" that in some states immigrants without documents are being urged to submit their info to get driver licenses - info that is then passed on to ICE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBI's Deputy Assistant Director&lt;strong&gt; Kimberly Del Greco&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/07/fbi-ice-find-state-drivers-license-photos-are-gold-mine-facial-recognition-searches/?utm_term=.79a7ecec5e90" target="_blank"&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; in favor of the practice, however, saying it worked to "to preserve our nation's freedoms, ensure our liberties are protected, and preserve our security." The difference, of course, is that the millions who are getting scanned have not been charged with any crimes.

Numbers have since gone down, but at a price – both Europe's attitudes towards migrants and its external borders have hardened; last Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/07/eu-latest-mediterranean-drowning-demands-courageous-response-from-eu-leaders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;150 migrants drowned&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of Libya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean's deadliest shipwreck this year – at least partly attributable to the withdrawal of official search and rescue operations and the criminalisation of NGO rescue boats – sparked few headlines across the continent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Refugees out&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="6ESIK31564670810" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="01e98" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDIzMDA4MC85ODB4LnBuZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjUyMDQ2Mzd9.A_20-kFFPQeHe8utwHiBPUCq4428DIYsEW57HsdxVI4/img.png"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, &lt;a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;keeps track &lt;/a&gt;of the movements of refugees and tries to manage them as best as possible. Buried beneath the more important numbers of refugees flowing &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Europe are smaller figures, for refugees &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As this map shows, &lt;strong&gt;Syria&lt;/strong&gt; remains red-hot, in terms of refugee population. According to the UNHCR, 6.7 million Syrians are refugees. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next-level sources of refugees are &lt;strong&gt;Iraq&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Iran&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Israel/Palestine&lt;/strong&gt; (between 100,000 and 1 million from each country).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As red turns to pink, we're entering Europe, with the &lt;strong&gt;former Soviet Union, ex-Yugoslavia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Turkey&lt;/strong&gt; as major source countries (between 10,000 and 100,000 from each). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A big chunk of &lt;strong&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/strong&gt; (as well as &lt;strong&gt;Northern Africa&lt;/strong&gt; and some other bits of the &lt;strong&gt;ex-USSR&lt;/strong&gt;) are yellow (between 1,000 and 10,000 refugees per country).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Escape from Monaco&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="ADTVK61564670810" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="d9acc" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDIzMTEwOC85ODB4LnBuZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjUxMzE0NjJ9.gZVBDBhnUxG92qECdrG2mTf9lM1_JWh1DmTpqLWw9Y4/img.png"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To varying degrees, war, civil strife, oppression and poverty could be cited as push factors for people to flee any of those countries. But as we move into shades of green, the countries become more affluent and liberal, and the reasons more mystifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two Baltic countries (&lt;strong&gt;Estonia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Latvia&lt;/strong&gt;) and three Balkan ones (&lt;strong&gt;Montenegro&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Greece&lt;/strong&gt;) are the source of between 100 and 1,000 refugees. These places may be struggling economically but are generally considered to be peaceful and free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even west of the former Iron Curtain, most countries generate between 10 and 100 refugees – not just larger ones like the &lt;strong&gt;UK&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Germany&lt;/strong&gt;, but also smaller ones like &lt;strong&gt;Belgium&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Portugal&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Austria&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the lowest category (less than 10 refugees) are Europe's least populous nations, including &lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Iceland&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Denmark&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Switzerland&lt;/strong&gt;. But not even the micronations are refugee-free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this infographic shows, &lt;strong&gt;Andorra&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Monaco&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/strong&gt; are the home countries of three refugees each. Two refugees hail from &lt;strong&gt;San Marino&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; micronation enclaved within Italy  (no refugees from the Vatican, though). Even Gibraltar the the home of a single, solitary refugee. Who are these people? Why did they run away from places many more people are struggling to get into? Here are two of their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A clash of parenting cultures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="37RAL11564670810" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b67ea" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDIzNjI0NC85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjUyNTQ2ODN9.Uiom4C5U8CoSPkIbtuv5tL1DxbAGKbVO-AQjA3HMvuM/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent article in the German press (&lt;a href="https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2019-05/flucht-norwegen-sorgerecht-asyl-fluechtlinge-polen-staatsaffaere-english/komplettansicht" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Zeit&lt;/em&gt;, 15 May 2019&lt;/a&gt;) discusses the case of a Norwegian woman who fled her country because she feared the state would take away her baby. Silje Garmo claims she was harassed by &lt;em&gt;Barnevernet&lt;/em&gt;, the Norwegian child protection agency. The agency claimed Garmo led a "chaotic life", which prevented her from adequately caring for the child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman feared the agency would take the child into custody – as had happened with her older daughter. In May 2017, mother and then newborn baby went into hiding – fleeing to Poland shortly thereafter. Garmo eventually applied for asylum in Poland. This was granted in December 2018, triggering a diplomatic crisis between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnevernet is frequently accused of heavy-handedness, including by a number of Polish immigrant families who have lost custody of their children. This could be ascribed in part to the difference in cultural attitudes towards child-rearing between liberal Norway and conservative Poland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That point of friction may also be why Poland eventually decided to grant Garmo asylum, something Polish authorities do exceedingly rarely: it offers Poland moral leverage in its fight for the Polish parents in Norway who are seeking to regain custody of their children. That fight has escalated earlier this year, with first Norway and then Poland expelling consular staff from each other's diplomatic missions. Relations between the two countries are now at their lowest point in living memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Homeschooling away from home&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="MBETW11564670810" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ee53e" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMDIzMjE1OS85ODB4LmpwZyIsImV4cGlyZXNfYXQiOjE1NjQ5MDE2NDV9.PKdO3au--WjcoseAsSAhz2nwV4IrloLYJP6yknJ5WVk/img.jpg"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the Romeike family fled from Germany to the US and applied for asylum. Devout Christians, Uwe and Hannelore Romeike believe in homeschooling their five children – a practice strictly forbidden by German law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taking their children out of Germany's public school system, the Romeikes received fines running into thousands of euros, and lived in the fear that the German government would take custody of their children. So they fled to the US, where up to 2 million children are homeschooled legally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first time refugees to the US used the right to homeschool their children as grounds for protected status. Following their lead, a few other German homeschooling families have sought refuge in the US. Other German homeschoolers have gone to New Zealand and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the Romeikes were granted asylum in a ruling that was subsequently overturned. However, in 2014 the Department of Homeland Security &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/home-schooling-german-family-allowed-stay-us/story?id=22788876" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;allowed them to remain&lt;/a&gt; in the country indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely they will remain in America for the time being: in January 2019, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) upheld Germany's prohibition of home education. The &lt;a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-188994%22]}" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ECHR ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the law did not violate the human rights of Dirk and Petra Wunderlich, a German husband and wife who had been homeschooling their four children. The children were forcibly removed from their home near Darmstadt for three weeks in 2013, after which the Wunderlichs nevertheless refused to stop homeschooling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School attendance has been compulsory in Germany since 1918. The only exceptions are children with a severe illness, children of diplomats and child actors. Despite the ban, between 300 and 600 German children are being homeschooled at present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two examples point to child custody issues as a main source of refugee cases originating in Europe's affluent liberal democracies. Based on fairly partial evidence, that may be an unwarranted conclusion. As mentioned, individual stories of refugees from these countries in Europe are hard to come by.
