    <title>Andrew Yang is out to save the American mall</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p&gt;Yang’s pro-traditional retail, anti-Amazon stance came out during the second round of Democratic debates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="X2GRzy"&gt;Andrew Yang threw a punch at Amazon during Wednesday night’s Democratic debates, which served, in part, to bolster his presidential campaign’s plan to save traditional retail. And the key to saving traditional retail, Yang believes, is to save the mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ony4UU"&gt;“Raise your hand in the crowd if you’ve seen stores closing where you live,” he &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democratic-debate-transcript-july-31-2019-n1038016"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; from the debate stage in Detroit. “It is not just you. Amazon is closing 30 percent of America’s stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bg0ilR"&gt;Yang’s claim is a little misleading — Amazon is not actively shutting down stores or malls, but rather is a contributing force in brick and mortar’s waning relevancy. Still, he speaks to a bigger issue, and puts forth a unique theory: Traditional retail must change or it will die, and it might need federal aid to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWI4xQ"&gt;Yang is an entrepreneur who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/06/10/feature/random-man-runs-for-president-the-odd-saga-of-andrew-yang-explained/?utm_term=.884de7d1b01c"&gt;says he made millions&lt;/a&gt; as CEO of test prep startup Manhattan Prep, which education services provider Kaplan (then &lt;a href="https://kaplan.com/about-us-overview/history/"&gt;owned by the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;) acquired in 2009. He’s one of two non-career politicians competing for the Democratic ticket — and he may be the only one with a mall plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCNwmT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/238711/andrew-yang-freedom-dividend-american-mall-act"&gt;Dubbed the American Mall Act&lt;/a&gt;, Yang’s policy would fund struggling malls with matching grants and tax incentives to the tune of $6 billion. Investing in and revitalizing dead malls doesn’t just mean bringing retail back; he’s also a big believer in transforming and repurposing malls into “[o]ffices, churches, indoor recreation spaces, anything we can do to keep these spaces vital and positive is an enormous win for the surrounding community,” &lt;a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/american-mall-act/"&gt;reads his campaign site&lt;/a&gt;. Mall closures, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1147609257673670661"&gt;Yang tweeted&lt;/a&gt; last month, “have a disastrous effect on local property values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LHV8T"&gt;Malls are dying, we know. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/business/why-everyone-goes-to-the-mall.html"&gt;At one time&lt;/a&gt; the US was home to 25,000 shopping centers, 2,000 of which loomed large as the classic enclosed variety that we picture when we talk about “the mall:” climate-controlled, multi-level, windowless and flanked on each end by well-lit department stores. There are just over &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/fashion/an-ode-to-shopping-malls.html"&gt;1,000 indoor American malls&lt;/a&gt; alive today, with &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/02/news/economy/doomed-malls/index.html"&gt;analysts&lt;/a&gt; putting the number of mall closures within the next five years at between 20 and 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TM06T"&gt;A sector of the mall market manages to survive, and in fact thrives, as I reported for &lt;a href="https://www.racked.com/2016/8/2/12290506/american-malls-south-coast-plaza"&gt;Racked&lt;/a&gt; in 2016: the luxury mall. According to data from real estate research firm Green Street Advisors, the nearly 300 malls graded A++ through A- in mall performance today — maintaining strong sales and top-tier tenants — account for 80 percent of overall mall value, while the nearly 400 lowest-performing malls maintain scant occupancy and account for less than 1 percent of mall value. Put another way: Hundreds of malls are doing very well, but more are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpek2Y"&gt;Abandoned malls are what the &lt;a href="https://placesjournal.org/assets/legacy/pdfs/incremental-urbanism-greyfield-reclamation.pdf"&gt;Congress for the New Urbanism coined&lt;/a&gt; “greyfields,” &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/07/andrew-yang-plan-malls-greyfields-2020-election-democrats/593440/"&gt;as reported by CityLab&lt;/a&gt;, for the seas of parking lots that surround them. Yang’s campaign pledge to transform vacant malls into multi-purpose spaces is right in line with New Urbanism’s architectural and urban planning movement to create mixed-use, &lt;a href="https://www.retailwire.com/discussion/are-live-work-shop-play-environments-a-big-part-of-retails-future/"&gt;“live, work, shop, play” centers&lt;/a&gt; — like The Domain in Austin, an open-air, pedestrian-inclined center owned by high-end Simon Property Group that houses “&lt;a href="https://www.simon.com/mall/the-domain"&gt;upscale and mainstream&lt;/a&gt;” retail and dining, Whole Foods, yoga and spin studios, office space, mid-rise apartments, salons, spas, and a couple hotels. This year, the &lt;a href="https://www.icsc.com/news-and-views/icsc-exchange/icsc-finds-brick-and-mortar-thriving-as-consumers-seek-experience-and-conve"&gt;International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) found&lt;/a&gt; that 78 percent of US adults would consider living in such a center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N5V6IH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For Yang, dead malls are a symbol of an economy in flux as much as they are real problems demanding real solutions, a representation of what Yang describes as an employment crisis well on its way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vPm9kW"&gt;For Yang, dead malls are a symbol of an economy in flux as much as they are real problems demanding real solutions, a representation of what Yang describes as an employment crisis well on its way. The next 12 years, says his campaign, will see a third of American workers in danger of job loss thanks to automation wrought by new tech. In response, Yang’s central campaign promise is to pay every American adult citizen a &lt;a href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/"&gt;universal basic income&lt;/a&gt; of $1,000 per month, funded by a value-added tax and called the Freedom Dividend. It’s the centerpiece of his platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obS2Nu"&gt;Yang’s mall policy is an otherwise distinct piece of his platform; what it shares with his UBI policy, however, is a business-focused effort to stimulate local economies. Investment in malls, Yang says, will create jobs. As &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/238711/andrew-yang-freedom-dividend-american-mall-act"&gt;Connie Wang writes for Refinery29&lt;/a&gt;, “In a presidential primary in which Democratic candidates are debating the virtues of socialism versus capitalism, Yang has presented a third option that’s resonating with a community of entrepreneurial millennials who pride themselves on practicality: The government should recognize the ills of capitalism, but the solutions should lie in government-backed, business-oriented policies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0RLi6"&gt;Yang’s vision may be untenable, given that not every struggling mall has much chance of life after death, due to location challenges and zoning disputes (&lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/07/andrew-yang-plan-malls-greyfields-2020-election-democrats/593440/"&gt;as CityLab notes&lt;/a&gt;), not to mention an ever-changing retail landscape. And some cities are either wary of receiving federal aid, or unable to put in the funds necessary to receive a matching grant, &lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/238711/andrew-yang-freedom-dividend-american-mall-act"&gt;reports Wang&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, not every mall can simply reinvent itself as a luxury mixed-use center, and catapult itself into the upper echelon of top-performing malls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3M1lO"&gt;Yang and the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1156261252060069893"&gt;Yang Gang&lt;/a&gt;,” however, are poised to try.  With unique donors exceeding 130,000 and polling numbers hitting 2 percent in three out of the four required polls, the candidate is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/politics/next-democratic-debate.html"&gt;close to qualifying&lt;/a&gt; for the next Democratic debates. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>North Korea just carried out its third missile test in just over a week</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="A woman walks past a television news screen showing an image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looking at the test-fire of a new multiple rocket launcher, at a railway station in Seoul on August 1, 2019." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0JvHWkOMYCW_yeJghK6yJHqr20=/0x0:4704x3528/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64897775/GettyImages_1158925078.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Trump probably won’t care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="s0tC8D"&gt;North Korea is at it again, testing a third set of missiles in just over a week. If anyone thought President Donald Trump’s personal friendship with Kim Jong Un would make these threatening moves go away, it’s officially time to think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNfxLj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLBicker/status/1157021594155270144?s=20"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/north-korea-launches-still-more-short-range-ballistic-missiles-n1038396"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; militaries have confirmed the newest test. According to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, the North fired an unknown, short-range projectile into the Sea of Japan from the country’s Yonghung province in the south. That adds to the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/30/20747786/north-korea-missile-test-second-trump"&gt;rocket launches&lt;/a&gt; this week and a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/24/20726618/north-korea-misisle-trump-bolton"&gt;similar missile test&lt;/a&gt; last week. As of now, it’s unclear how far the projectiles flew or how high they went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYdFsP"&gt;Two main things explain why Kim is launching such a barrage these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndJRGX"&gt;First, it’s mostly a message to Seoul not to go forward with a planned August &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/07/19/us-south-korea-military-exercise-go-despite-norths-threats-4-star-says.html"&gt;military exercise&lt;/a&gt; with the US. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-usa-southkorea/no-plan-to-change-south-korea-us-military-exercise-us-official-says-idUSKCN1UQ2RA"&gt;South Korea has not canceled the drill&lt;/a&gt;, so North Korea may keep testing missiles until Seoul or Washington caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXPPq9"&gt;Second, Trump has given Kim almost complete license to test any weapons he wants short of a nuclear bomb or intercontinental ballistic missile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ88HU"&gt;The reason is straightforward: The US and North Korea have made little progress in their diplomatic effort to reach a deal over dismantling Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Kim wants Trump to lift sanctions on his country before he gives up some of his weapons, and Trump wants Kim to give up nearly all of his weapons before he lifts the sanctions. As a result, the two sides remain locked in a stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qotzku"&gt;Trump’s stance, though, is that North Korea is more likely to dismantle its nuclear program as long as he and Kim remain friendly. That consideration seemingly outweighs almost anything else going on between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9O40C"&gt;Which is why Trump will likely shrug off this latest test, just as he has with all the others over the past week. “I have no problem,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/W7VOA/status/1157023561363705856"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; told reporters outside the White House after being asked about North Korea’s other two launches. “These are short-range missiles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7uzTQ"&gt;Sen. Edward Markey (D-MA), a top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wants Trump and the administration to be a little tougher on Kim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5DMwV"&gt;“Not only has President Trump failed to codify in writing a nuclear and missile testing freeze, but when he says he has ‘no problem’ with shorter range missile launches, he gives North Korea a green light to violate UN Security Council resolutions and threaten our allies,” Markey said in a statement. “Instead of willfully ignoring these launches, President Trump and Secretary Pompeo must strongly and definitively call on North Korea to halt these provocations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDBDsv"&gt;On one hand, it’s reasonable, and perhaps even prudent, for Trump and his administration not to overreact to Kim’s weaponry. It’s better not to blow up any chance of diplomatic progress over a few missile tests, no matter how threatening. On the other hand, some experts say the administration could do much more than brush off those provocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1X5EfP"&gt;“Maybe they’re picking their battles to focus on resuming much-needed negotiations for a deal,” Duyeon Kim, a North Korea expert at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington, told me last week after Pyongyang’s first of three recent missile tests. “But if they continue to dismiss smaller missiles for long, they’re enabling Pyongyang to strengthen these dangerous weapons and telling South Korea and Americans living there that they don’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The viral video of Lindsey Graham silencing Senate Democrats, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jla96Xc4hYw8QIrKVi6bMjSNbtU=/0x0:2667x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64897674/1150820715.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) questions Kelly Craft, President Trump’s nominee to be representative to the United Nations, during her nomination hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. | Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s the latest instance of Republicans in the Senate basically doing whatever they want. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="7Y2wRW"&gt;Sen. Lindsey Graham’s (R-SC) behavior during a Judiciary Committee meeting on Thursday revealed just how little Republicans care about respecting congressional rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjG9zC"&gt;The panel, which was considering a bill from Graham to reform the asylum process, kicked off in a surprising way. While calling for a committee vote on the legislation, Graham effectively silenced Democrats in his efforts to push through the bill, a move that’s quite rare, if not unheard of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMjOkN"&gt;Typically, if a bill is brought up for a vote, &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/about/rules"&gt;a committee rule&lt;/a&gt; allows for any lawmaker that opposes it to delay consideration of that bill another week. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/1156982486737543168"&gt;As George Washington University’s Sarah Binder&lt;/a&gt; noted on Twitter, this rule does not guarantee that the bill vote will be delayed, but it’s typically been respected by committee chairs in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAmH6W"&gt;Not only did Graham not allow Democrats to advocate for any kind of delay, he didn’t let them speak at all before advancing the bill, infuriating several of the lawmakers in the minority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7gqHtu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lindsey Graham calls for a vote on an asylum bill before Judiciary Committee Democrats speak, via CSPAN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Graham: "The clerk will call the roll."&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;Feinstein: "You're breaking the rules of the Committee ... Mr. Chairman, this is unprecedented." &lt;a href="https://t.co/3nITYIQ6qE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3nITYIQ6qE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1156957966073049090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8e3YjW"&gt;“You’re breaking the rules of the committee,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the top Democrat on the panel. Graham, however, did not back down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAeYxM"&gt;Instead, he barreled forward with a vote on the Secure and Protect Act, a bill that would require asylum seekers from Central America to apply for asylum outside the US in their home countries and Mexico. Graham’s bill would also extend the amount of time that families are kept in detention from 20 days to 100 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X770Xb"&gt;Democrats strongly disagree with several tenets of the bill. Not only did Graham not appear to care on Thursday, he did pretty much whatever he could to ignore them completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAHRyt"&gt;While Senate Republicans have the majority and can do basically whatever they want (committee rules like the one Graham ignored are only really enforced if both parties are interested in doing so),&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;committee leadership has typically enabled lawmakers from the other side of the aisle to, at a basic level, raise their concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwThls"&gt;In order to get his immigration legislation through before the Senate heads out for a roughly month-long recess, it appears Graham simply didn’t care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d965Ao"&gt;His efforts are the latest in a string of actions that Senate Republicans have taken to flout norms in the upper chamber. While it’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/16/20696932/nancy-pelosi-trump-tweet-racist-chaos"&gt;House Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have also recently run afoul of rules, in order to call President Donald Trump’s comments racist, Republican leadership in the Senate, in particular, has seen a sharp breakdown in decorum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="H1Y9rS"&gt;Graham argued that Democrats gave him no choice. That’s not true. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="g2gio4"&gt;While Graham’s behavior made for an explosive committee meeting on Thursday, the start of all this drama can actually be traced to last week, when he brought the asylum bill up for consideration at a previous mark-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KS24Z"&gt;At the time, just one Democrat attended. Despite the fact that he did not have a quorum of minority lawmakers — two as required by Senate procedure — Graham deferred consideration of the bill. As the Committee’s rules indicate, if Graham was interested in conducting any “business” on legislation, including the deferral of a bill, he needed a quorum. Since he didn’t have one at the time, any action on the bill was technically bending the rules, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/1156982486737543168"&gt;Binder wrote in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M7BDzg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As for as rule breaking (bending??), this was a double dipper! Last week, Graham seems to have ignored SJC quorum rule, meaning that SJC couldn't have acted to defer bill till today. And then today, he ignored rule that allows (not guarantees) single senator to delay a vote.&lt;/p&gt;— Sarah Binder (@bindersab) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/1156982486737543168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SAVQRb"&gt;“Under Committee rules, business cannot be transacted unless there are two members present from the minority,” a Judiciary Committee press release stated, in response to the situation. “The Democrats’ refusal to attend is designed to prevent the legislation from coming to a vote in committee. Chairman Graham pledged to confront the delay, bring the bill up again next week, and force a committee vote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AEon"&gt;Graham stood by this decision on Thursday. “You are not going to take my job away from me. I take this very personally. I tried my best,” he said, arguing that he had tried for weeks to advance this bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Us96eu"&gt;Graham also emphasized that Democrats’ absences at the prior meeting had been intentional and designed to thwart the advancement of his legislation. At least one Democrat, former Senate Judiciary Chair Patrick Leahy said that was not the case. Leahy explained that had missed the meeting because he was attending a funeral. He also noted that several Republicans did not show up for last week’s meeting, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ogacY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorLeahy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SenatorLeahy&lt;/a&gt;: "I wasn't here last week because a member of my family was being buried that day."&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LindseyGrahamSC&lt;/a&gt;: "Duly noted. I apologize…I don't mean to make it personal, but I was told nobody's going to come for the expressed purpose, so I could not mark this bill up." &lt;a href="https://t.co/an6ZaR68hX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/an6ZaR68hX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CSPAN (@cspan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1156944894948249602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cBaZBE"&gt;Graham was not ultimately moved by Democratic blowback. “What you’re telling me is I should ignore what you did to me last week. I will not,” Graham said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07Qy5j"&gt;Graham emphasized that he was still advancing the legislation with a majority vote. Eleven Republican senators voted with him to move the bill to the Senate floor. Additionally, as Binder stated, much of the adherence to these committee rules are based on a mutual agreement between lawmakers in the two parties. While Democrats have historically been able to push back the vote for a bill they disagree with by a week, for example, that’s only because Republicans have respected that norm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIp1D0"&gt;Given Graham’s actions on Thursday, they appear to be done doing anything of that sort. If Graham had been willing to wait until after recess, it’s likely he could have achieved the exact same result, while abiding by existing norms. He clearly passed on that opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8yksX2"&gt;This move is just the latest one Republicans have employed to blow up the upper chamber’s norms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrx5gE"&gt;Graham’s decision to move forward with his legislation, and disregard Democratic concerns, is just the latest in a line of similar moves by Republicans, who’ve indicated little adherence to Senate norms during their time in the majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2vt7h"&gt;While some of these efforts have been particularly notable — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15970034/mitch-mcconnell-senate-health-bill"&gt;completely block Merrick Garland&lt;/a&gt; from consideration for the Supreme Court stands out — others have concerned norms that simply gave members of the minority party a say on an issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XfsIX"&gt;During Leahy’s time as judiciary chair, for example, lawmakers could use a tool known as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/13/16462128/blue-slips-senate-republican-judge-nomination-appointment"&gt;the blue slip&lt;/a&gt; to indicate their disapproval of judicial nominees. If lawmakers from a nominee’s state did not return their blue slips, they blocked him or her from advancing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq7XLJ"&gt;Increasingly, with Republicans in power in the upper chamber, the respect for blue slips has taken a hit. In numerous instances this year when Democratic lawmakers have opposed judicial nominees tied to their home states, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/democrats-fume-as-gop-ignores-senate-tradition-to-approve-trumps-judicial-nominee"&gt;the candidate has been approved anyway.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgsXoD"&gt;Because so much of the Senate’s procedure is based on the enforcement of the party in power, the interpretation of these rules is subject to those who have the majority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCKhZb"&gt;Republicans have demonstrated that when they do, they only intend to adhere to decorum when it suits them. This attitude has spurred a push among some Democrats to consider a similar approach for when they retake the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWnmEd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The progressive case for free trade</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) (left) and Sen.

  &lt;p&gt;2020 Democrats like Warren and Sanders are skeptical of free trade. They shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="z3GK5M"&gt;Just ahead of the second round of democratic debates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a trade policy plan that extends her “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/a-plan-for-economic-patriotism-13b879f4cfc7?source=post_page---------------------------"&gt;economic patriotism&lt;/a&gt;” agenda to trade policy, asserting that free trade has benefited “big multinational corporations and international capital at the expense of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/trade-on-our-terms-ad861879feca"&gt;American workers&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6AVDf"&gt;Unfortunately, despite some bright spots regarding human rights, Warren’s plan is merely another voice in the chorus of misguided progressive &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/30/elizabeth-warrens-trade-plan-is-bad-politics-worse-policy/?utm_term=.295471e72db0"&gt;condemnations of trade&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen from people like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/01/transcript-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.722bb1d3bbb7"&gt;Tulsi Gabbard&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/principles-for-trade/"&gt;Congressional Progressive Caucus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8p6ljG"&gt;Progressives’ anti-trade stance is wrongheaded and ultimately hamstrings Americans’ well-being and global economic growth. Trade isn’t nearly as bad for American jobs as many progressives argue it to be — and is an often unrecognized boon to American families and businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMeQUB"&gt;Ahead of the 2020 elections, the left must not merely condemn the deleterious effects of trade, but also recognize the tremendous political and economic benefits free trade has provided for Americans across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oCOt49"&gt;Progressives and the politics of trade &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv7ynT"&gt;The Trump administration has been characterized by a series of ham-fisted and vindictive trade policies. The &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-04/evidence-grows-that-trump-s-trade-wars-are-hitting-u-s-economy"&gt;trade war&lt;/a&gt; with China has resulted in higher prices for everyday consumer goods and has left farmers throughout the country watching their crops rot and incomes evaporate without access to the export markets they’ve &lt;a href="https://reason.com/2019/07/05/trumps-trade-war-continues-to-crush-soybean-farmers/"&gt;cultivated for decades&lt;/a&gt;. The government recently announced a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/us-to-pay-farmers-up-to-16-billion-for-trade-war-losses-south-to-benefit-idUSKCN1UK2M7"&gt;$16 billion plan&lt;/a&gt; to compensate farmers for the losses they’ve suffered from this entirely avoidable trade war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibvEwa"&gt;Within just a few months of the trade war beginning, there was a &lt;a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/record-number-americans-endorse-benefits-trade"&gt;surge&lt;/a&gt; in Americans’ support for free trade in response to President Trump’s disastrous trade policies. The poll, conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in 2018, found that 84 percent of Democrats believe that “international trade is good for the US economy”; 71 percent also believed that trade bolsters job creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WgPBr"&gt;Given this, you might expect the slew of progressive Democrats vying to be the party’s presidential nominee to embrace free trade. Instead, candidates are &lt;a href="https://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-trade/"&gt;deriding free trade &lt;/a&gt;as a threat to American workers and advocating for protectionism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcqFMK"&gt;Yet during both nights of the second Democratic debate, free trade was condemned. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/31/transcript-first-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.f3341e75c6a3"&gt;Warren &lt;/a&gt;asserted that trade deals “have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind.” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/01/transcript-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.722bb1d3bbb7"&gt;Gabbard&lt;/a&gt; suggested that free trade deals “give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msJBxL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/31/transcript-first-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.f3341e75c6a3"&gt;Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, troublingly, seemed to suggest that his administration would use federal contracting opportunities to punish firms; he stated “these guys line up at the federal trough. They want military contracts. They want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration, you ain’t going to get those contracts if you’re throwing American workers out on the street.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSBH0t"&gt;The unwillingness of many progressives, including frontrunners Warren and Sanders, to engage with the benefits of free trade is bad politics and bad policy. Free trade helps American families afford the things they buy every day, is integral to the way American businesses produce their goods, and has a positive effect on international relations by promoting democratization abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7qPYTS"&gt;The effect of trade on the American economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="861FAJ"&gt;Working-class Americans and American businesses both benefit from free trade.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/payoff-america-globalization-fresh-look-focus-costs-workers"&gt;Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates&lt;/a&gt; that the expansion in free trade between 1950 and 2016 “generated annual and recurring income gains of roughly $2.1 trillion in 2016 for the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCo4Ah"&gt;This translates to an &lt;a href="https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/payoff-america-globalization-fresh-look-focus-costs-workers"&gt;$18,000&lt;/a&gt; increase in the income of American households, in part due to more affordable imported consumer goods. Of particular note for progressives concerned with working-class families’ well-being is the study’s suggestion that poorer families in particular benefited from the expansion of trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w1DrR"&gt;American producers also benefit from more affordable imports: A &lt;a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/ImportsWork_FIN.pdf"&gt;2013 Chamber of Commerce study&lt;/a&gt; found that 60 percent of American imports are bought by American factories and farms. These imports are critical aspects of these American businesses, serving as inputs to American production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47yCdf"&gt;Imports are, in these instances, complementary to the American economy — not a substitute for the goods we’re producing within our borders. In fact, making it harder for companies and farms to access these inputs would seriously hamstring the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHKkvU"&gt;In lieu of emphasizing the benefits of free trade for American consumers and businesses, progressives often deride free trade as a job killer. In fact, many of the job losses in manufacturing come not from free trade but, according to a 2018 report from the Urban Institute, from &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/97781/is_foreign_trade_the_cause_of_manufacturing_job_losses_2.pdf"&gt;increased productivity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yt3CxM"&gt;Relatedly, stagnant wages should not be attributed to free trade — the Peterson Institute&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;found that &lt;a href="https://piie.com/blogs/trade-investment-policy-watch/does-foreign-trade-and-investment-reduce-average-us-wages-and-0"&gt;less than 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the gap between American workers’ productivity and compensation can be explained by global competition. Furthermore, a &lt;a href="https://tradepartnership.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Trade-and-American-2016.pdf"&gt;2016 study by Trade Partnership Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, a consulting firm specializing in international trade, estimated that “every U.S. state has realized net employment gains directly attributable to trade.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A9IYZ"&gt;Free trade is neither the job killer nor the wage slasher that many have portrayed it to be. Because the benefits of trade are diffuse and quotidian, while the drawbacks of free trade are concentrated (and often politicized), it is easy to overlook the fact that the former is greater than the latter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FiNVe6"&gt;The effect of trade on world politics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RVqVZv"&gt;Progressive candidates have articulated the threat that rising inequality and kleptocracy pose to American interests. Warren’s plan attempts to connect American trade policy to American values, a laudable and critical endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeUntk"&gt;Yet by making these characteristics a precondition for entrance into free trade agreements, as Warren has, this plan merely contributes to the suffering of those who live in closed economies and oppressive societies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RohDH"&gt;Protectionist policies are linked to increased &lt;a href="https://faculty.insead.edu/pushan-dutt/documents/corruption_trade07.pdf"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; and are more likely to bolster the disproportionate influence of the wealthiest in society, who will be best posed to lobby for benefits and protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tph9Cf"&gt;Furthermore, there’s &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022002714535431?casa_token=vEWEEMolGb0AAAAA:8J0Qzx8XMnl5u8cgy_qxMUCLYKIgx1Lr3JvmCATjD2JXvNeeM-IsDG215OYXyLukgGl3CCCdB3UYo0A"&gt;compelling evidence&lt;/a&gt; describing a process of mutual reinforcement between democratization and entrance into preferential trade agreements. In short, the problem facing the international community today isn’t free trade — it’s insufficient economic regulation and poor governance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2uD54"&gt;Free trade also provides opportunities for America to broker strong partnerships; protectionism is both immiserating and isolating. Take, for example, the abandoned &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/tpp/"&gt;Trans-Pacific Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a vast free trade agreement the Obama administration negotiated with 12 countries including Australia, Japan, and Vietnam, and which the Trump administration pulled out of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTyD3X"&gt;The TPP was not merely a means of bolstering the American economy (though it certainly was designed to do that); it was also a means for the United States to place pressure on China and to protect American security interests in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzcsQw"&gt;By abandoning it (a move both &lt;a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/stop-the-tpp"&gt;Sanders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/elizabeth-warren-trade-tpp-225214"&gt;Warren&lt;/a&gt; encouraged), the US has stepped away from a trade agreement that included “the most robust &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Preserving-the-Environment-Fact-Sheet.pdf"&gt;enforceable environment commitments&lt;/a&gt; of any trade agreement in history,” according to the United States Trade Representative, and which sought to put an end to &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Protecting-Workers-Fact-Sheet.pdf"&gt;child labor&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also allowed China to advance its interests in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hdwgG"&gt;Advancing American interests abroad through cooperative agreements that allow states to engage in democratic reforms, without depending on the military, is exactly what progressives say they want to do. Smart free trade agreements — not protectionist measures — are the best way to pursue these objectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EX3go8"&gt;Harnessing free trade for progressive objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUc56W"&gt;Progressives must recognize that domestically, the problem with free trade as it is currently practiced is in the distribution of gains from trade and the lack of protections for those&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;workers who lose their jobs as a result of international trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBQTyy"&gt;The best means of supporting those who lose their jobs as a result of the American economy’s shift toward producing other types of goods isn’t regaining American competitiveness in that sector. Because the American economy is “capital rich” relative to the rest of the world, increasing free trade will benefit capital-intensive industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hZy3p"&gt;Though some in the party have considered this a result of nefarious lobbying by “big business,” the &lt;a href="https://www.toolshero.com/strategy/heckscher-ohlin-model/"&gt;Heckscher-Ohlin model&lt;/a&gt; (which since its publication in the 1930s has become integral to our understanding of the patterns of international trade) predicts this as a natural outgrowth of America’s factor endowment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dg9fhV"&gt;Though multinational corporations have certainly thrown their weight around in trade deals to advance their interests, limiting their influence in trade negotiations will not eradicate the American economy’s comparative advantage in producing capital-rich products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmVUiI"&gt;Progressive Democrats should be designing and advocating for policies that distribute the gains from trade and ensure that those who bear the burden of a shifting American economy are not left behind. One way of doing so is to ensure those who lose their jobs have access to retraining programs that integrate them into the modern American economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0p6Lz3"&gt;The Congressional Progressive Caucus’s &lt;a href="https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/principles-for-trade/"&gt;Principles for Trade&lt;/a&gt; calls for an expansion of the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) — a viable policy that has not been given its due by the Democratic presidential contenders. Previous assessments both &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/650/648980.pdf"&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/ETAOP_2013_10_Participant_Impact_Report.pdf"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; the US government of the TAA have found it is an inadequate response to the needs of displaced workers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qZKAe"&gt;When pressed on this issue during the second Democratic debate, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg dodged the question, stating, “Of course we need to do retraining. We’re doing it now in South Bend,” before pivoting to a discussion of the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/31/transcript-first-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.0aa9c3ed7428"&gt;“gig economy.”&lt;/a&gt; Warren’s plan doesn’t engage with the issue of displaced workers or worker retraining at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raQOC4"&gt;Warren’s plan to connect American values to our trade deals — by ensuring that the rights of workers be respected and the environment protected — is an excellent idea. And her plan to work with the World Trade Organization to create a “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/trade-on-our-terms-ad861879feca"&gt;non-sustainable economy&lt;/a&gt;” designation for countries with “systematically poor labor and environmental practices” is innovative and shows how progressives can leverage international institutions to advance progressive principles at home and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaQ8O2"&gt;However, other aspects of the plan, such as making compliance with a number of standards (&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/trade-on-our-terms-ad861879feca"&gt;many of which the United States does not currently meet&lt;/a&gt;) a precondition for entering into new trade agreements, overlook how free trade and integration into the international community can foster democratization among our trading partners. A progressive trade plan must allow for our trade partners to use the benefits they reap from trade to finance and build support for democratic reform within their borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXjzVr"&gt;Progressives’ current stance ignores the vast benefits of free trade; ahead of the 2020 elections, it is vital for both progressives’ electoral viability and the well-being of Americans that they refrain from using free trade as a scapegoat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wZ183"&gt;Progressive democrats should be designing trade policies that promote free trade while providing a more robust and compassionate safety net — government policies that tax and redistribute the gains from trade so that all Americans can benefit from free trade should be as central to progressives’ policy agenda as a progressive income tax and universal health care.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Ryan told Bernie Sanders that Medicare-for-all would be bad for unions. Major union leaders disagree.</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPoeB3e2EfpfkrkD2dBvI5gOYmY=/115x0:2782x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64897173/1165223095.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks while Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg listen during the debate at the Fox Theatre July 30, 2019 in Detroit, Michigan. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Underlying Bernie Sanders’s viral “I wrote the damn bill” moment was a debate about union support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hhFfhK"&gt;This week, two of the lesser-known Democrats in the presidential race, Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/26/18701093/tim-ryan-2020-presidential-campaign-policies"&gt;Tim Ryan&lt;/a&gt; (OH) and former Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/26/18679032/john-delaney-2020-presidential-election-campaign-policies"&gt;John Delaney&lt;/a&gt; (MD), suggested on the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/30/20747246/democratic-debate-july-30-31-2019-schedule-news-updates"&gt;Democratic debate&lt;/a&gt; stage that Sen. Bernie Sanders’s Medicare-for-all plan goes against union interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1XIX2"&gt;“This plan being offered ... will tell the union members that give away wages in order to get good health care that they will lose their health care because Washington is going to come in and tell them they have a better plan,” Ryan said. Delaney talked about his father, a unionized electrician, suggesting he would “never want someone to take [his health care] away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyHpCH"&gt;But some of the biggest unions in the country couldn’t disagree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDfd7S"&gt;“Tim Ryan, that’s a great failure of understanding how unions work,” said Sarah Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. His suggestion was “offensive to me,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5T7N9G"&gt;American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten noted that that AFT is supportive of Medicare-for-all and other universal health care plans. “Any plan that provides more people with the care they need and gets us one step closer to affordable coverage is a step in the right direction,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9NTt9"&gt;Both Ryan and Delaney oppose Medicare-for-all on the grounds it is radical, politically unfeasible, and too disruptive to the current health care system. They advocate instead for proposals that would expand coverage while keeping private employer-sponsored plans.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1cnoV"&gt;Ryan’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment about where he got this idea. But those close to the labor movement suggested it may come from a vestige of a shrinking and transforming labor movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RhryF"&gt;“Ryan, coming from Ohio, really frames this in terms of the union members with hard hats,” said Andrew Feldman, a Democratic strategist who has close ties to the labor movement. “It’s this old guard of labor. What we have seen in the last couple years, is this labor movement that’s made this grassroots resurgence, [like the teachers and service workers]. Those unions have publicly come out and said they would support Medicare-for-all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9k0oy4"&gt;The debate around Medicare-for-all and unions, explained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MoB6Ce"&gt;Delaney and Ryan were trying to pit some Sanders’s biggest priorities — universal health care and worker’s rights — against each other. Their argument centered around the fact that Sanders’s Medicare-for-all bill does away with employer-sponsored insurance and puts every American on an expanded public health care system. They say that unions have fought hard to secure generous health care packages from employers, and shouldn’t have to switch from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XJNfd"&gt;This debate erupted during the first night of the Democratic debates, as Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who also supports single-payer, clarified nobody’s insurance would be taken away. And it’s true — Sanders’s proposed plan is more generous than the typical private-sector plan, offering no co-pays or deductibles and covering virtually everything. If it were to pass as proposed, many unions likely would see Medicare-for-all as a better deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzh2HB"&gt;But even so, Ryan was hellbent on making the case that Medicare-for-all would undo union work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wA9qe"&gt;Here’s the full exchange, which led to Sanders’s most viral moment (when he swore at Ryan):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="7u3hRZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanders:&lt;/strong&gt; Medicare For All is comprehensive and covers all health care needs. For senior citizens, it will finally include dental care, hearing AIDS and eyeglasses. Second of all —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3BdVj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan:&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t know that, Bernie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z2lrs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanders: &lt;/strong&gt; I do know that. I wrote the damn bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91w50J"&gt;Second of all, many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here are now paying high deductibles and co-payments and when we do medicare for all, instead of having the company putting money into health care, they can get decent wage increases which they are not getting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="De78Wk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan: &lt;/strong&gt;Sen. Sanders does not know the union contracts in the United States. I’m trying to explain that these union members are losing their jobs. Their wages have been stagnant. The world is crumbling around them. The only thing they have is possibly really good health care, and the Democratic message is going to be we’re going to go in and the only thing you have left, we’re going to take and do better. I do not think that’s a recipe for success for us. It’s bad policy, and it’s certainly bad politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oazeh9"&gt;It should be noted that as a member of the House, Ryan has signed on to a Medicare-for-all bill, which would eliminate private insurance. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JStein_WaPo/status/1156650639029678080?s=20"&gt;His campaign told the Washington Post’&lt;/a&gt;s Jeff Stein that Ryan disagreed with some of the key components of that bill, but signed on hoping it would change in negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srGDGq"&gt;In making this case that Medicare-for-all was bad for unions, Ryan seemed to be echoing why many unions are open to the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcAYrl"&gt;“This is a priority we set in the 1940s, and labor was quite successful in negotiating contractural health care, but every time we go to the table the for-profit system has put so much pressure that when we get what we already have we call that a win,” Nelson told Vox about the difficulties negotiating health care poses. She added that having a government-sponsored baseline health insurance would go a long way to help unions negotiate better wages, and benefits in other areas of their contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0c17G"&gt;While there is a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/2/9634504/health-premium-wages-evidence"&gt;wealth of research&lt;/a&gt; that has found increased health care costs bring down wage growth, there’s less evidence that companies engage in the trade-off the other way. As &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/2/9634504/health-premium-wages-evidence"&gt;Sarah Kliff reported&lt;/a&gt;, “there are no studies that show the reverse relationship — wages rising when premiums grow slower — but experts in labor economics believe this relationship exists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Wy78wg"&gt;The labor movement looks very different today than what Delaney and Ryan seem to be talking about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="t6PBmD"&gt;Polling across the board shows that Americans aren’t too fond of the idea of cutting out private health insurance. A &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/17/20697846/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-2020-presidential"&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation poll&lt;/a&gt; found 56 percent of the public favors “a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all, where all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan.” But when told directly that Medicare-for-all would end private insurance, larger margins support more incremental steps toward a government-run program, like lowering the eligibility age for Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAO7wa"&gt;And it’s true that Democrats have some work to do shoring up union members. Clinton underperformed Barack Obama among union workers; white male union members significantly shifted toward Donald Trump, outpacing Clinton altogether to help deliver Trump the presidency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vekeBs"&gt;Those seem to be the voters Ryan is talking about; an older coalition of white working-class voters that defected to Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaPSJB"&gt;“I think [Ryan’s argument] may resonate because they are just more conservative in general and many actually voted for Trump,” Feldman said. “I don’t think it’s because they love their private health care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0ya4i"&gt;But candidates like Warren and Sanders are taking a different approach to the union vote. They recognize that the labor movement as a whole has been attempting to broaden its constituency to a progressive working class that didn’t necessarily see a champion in either Trump or Clinton in 2016. This more diverse working-class group — which includes women, Latinos, and African Americans — represents the fastest-growing share of union membership. And this growing sector of the labor movement might be ready for something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFBJXY"&gt;“No elected official should accept incrementalism,” Mary Kay Henry, president of Service Employees International Union, one of the largest and most influential unions in North America, told &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/31/20748937/democratic-debate-2019-detroit-working-class-union"&gt;Vox’s Alexia Fernandez Campbell&lt;/a&gt;. “American taxpayers are subsidizing multimillion-dollar companies that are making record profits but are not providing decent jobs for people. You can’t nibble around the edges. All these bold solutions are not radical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q23Lym"&gt;And, Nelson points out, not all union contracts are made the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIRVd4"&gt;“It is real that there is work to do with unions,” Nelson said. “People do love their contractural plans. But not every union contract today has exemplary health care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FECPl4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Target is rereleasing some of its most popular designer items from the past 20 years</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Lilly Pulitzer-designed products for Target stores, including handled bags, pillows, and picture frames." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyfM5WpVsYXqVDMjCVwK90hZVuA=/94x0:2761x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64897092/GettyImages_469853628.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Items from Target’s original Lilly Pulitzer collaboration, now being rereleased in part in September 2019. | Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Target&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Lilly Pulitzer, Missoni, Jason Wu, and more Target collaborations are coming back to the big-box store. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="YblsTo"&gt;In the last decade, thousands of people have stood in line at Target stores around the country to get their hands on colorful, limited-edition items designed by big names like Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer. Those were chaotic events, with shoppers grabbing merchandise by the armload. Online, these same frenzied buyers &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/missoni-craze-crashes-target-website/"&gt;crashed&lt;/a&gt; Target’s site multiple times. In case you missed out on the madness the first time around or are just ready to throw some elbows to get zigzag merchandise at a reasonable price, you’ll have your chance on September 14. Target just announced that it will be releasing a limited-edition collection of 300 products to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its design collaborations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Models wearing zigzag-patterned clothes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZw9EiOUHVg3DRHF6ZoKh1vzQVg=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18422948/Missoni_header.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Target&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5PoW7"&gt;Twenty of its previous collaborations are included, including Missoni, Lilly Pulitzer, Jason Wu, Isaac Mizrahi and others, as well as homeware designers like Michael Graves and Philippe Starck. Prices will range from $7 to $160. According to the retailer, collections and items will vary from store to store, and guests will be limited to five items of any given size and color. So far, no images or hints have been released about which specific items from past collections will be available this time around. Target is also putting out a documentary and a Rizzoli coffee table book to commemorate the occasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixwFsj"&gt;Target was one of the first retailers to pioneer the collaboration model. The company has decreased the frequency of these collabs, but they still occur, most recently in May with the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/17/18627056/target-fashion-collaborations-vineyard-vines"&gt;Vineyard Vines&lt;/a&gt; collection. Over the years, collaborative collections have become a regular occurrence at retailers at all price points, especially in the streetwear market, which relies on limited edition “drops” and frequent partnerships. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The brands that will be included in the Target collaboration re-release include Anna Sui, Thakoon, and Marimekko." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfMMdIIuJSSC-FfPmbe70tMNdJA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18423619/XXO_DesignerLogos_Horizontal_Download.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Target&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The brands that will be included in the Target collaboration rerelease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CpEwIn"&gt;At its heart, these types of collections act as marketing for the designer brand involved, which is usually more aspirational or expensive than others Target sells. But mostly, it’s an incredible way for Target to get people into its stores and to get people talking about Target, as a marketing professor &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/17/18627056/target-fashion-collaborations-vineyard-vines"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; to Vox back in May. It’s human nature to want what is hard to get or won’t be around for a long time, and Target excels at this marketing model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xlk7cw"&gt;While this anniversary collection will likely appeal to a wide swath of people, fashion fans should love this for the nostalgia factor alone. Jason Wu, Thakoon, Rodarte, and Proenza Schouler pieces are all included. And there is one timely update: Target has said that all of the women’s fashion pieces will be available in “extended sizing.” A lack of extended sizes has gotten the retailer into trouble in the past. In 2014, bloggers &lt;a href="https://www.racked.com/2014/8/18/7580715/altuzzara-for-target-boycott"&gt;boycotted&lt;/a&gt; Target for not offering the Altuzarra collection in plus-sizes. The next year, it produced plus-size pieces for the megapopular Lilly Pulitzer range, but it faced &lt;a href="https://www.racked.com/2015/1/16/7560567/target-lilly-pulitzer-plus-size"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; again because it only offered them online and not in stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTiqIe"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://fashionista.com/2011/02/target-re-releases-34-looks-from-past-collaborations-with-rodarte-proenza-shttps://fashionista.com/2011/02/target-re-releases-34-looks-from-past-collaborations-with-rodarte-proenza-schouler-thakoon-and-morechouler-thakoon-and-more"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, Target rereleased several of its fashion collaborations to celebrate five years of its Go International program, which is what is was called then. This collection will go beyond fashion, rereleasing a lot of the homeware collaborations as well, possibly including the popular home items from Missoni. Home is a hot category now. Anecdotal evidence: Erin Fetherston, who had a fashion collection with Target in 2007 and whose pieces will be included in this reboot, no longer designs fashion — she only sells &lt;a href="https://www.erinfetherston.com/"&gt;home goods&lt;/a&gt; now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A spinning-whistle tea kettle designed by Michael Graves for Target." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxGuR0Bz8AUUCV00bChIte74RkQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18421544/whistle.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Target&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A spinning-whistle tea kettle designed by Michael Graves for Target from 2000.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Agub5y"&gt;Target has been beefing up its private labels in-store, particularly in the home department. If you’ve ever seen how picked-over the HGTV darlings Chip and Joanna Gaines’ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fhearth-hand-with-magnolia%2F-%2FN-4k98u" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hearth &amp;amp; Hand collection&lt;/a&gt; is, you have a sense of this already. Presumably home design enthusiasts are going to be excited about scoring one of those late ’90s Michael Graves Seussian tea kettles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiqpCc"&gt;Target will undoubtedly capitalize on the same FOMO and anticipation that has driven these collections to such success in the past. In the next few weeks, Target will likely release teasers of items that will be included in this collection. Websites will release the lookbook. Shopping strategies will be planned. And the ultimate reason this exists: carts will be loaded. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian cities are choking under smoke from massive Siberian wildfires</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="An aerial view of forests burned in wildfires; over 1 million hectares of woodland have been hit by wildfires in Russia’s Krasnoyarsk Territory." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WzdfxHyxMIbfO4WsfVhtM95ZPQ=/710x0:2798x1566/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64897003/GettyImages_1158932017.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Wildfires have burned through Siberian forests this week, sending smoke over large sections of Russia. | Avialesookhrana/TASS/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Trump called Putin to offer help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XDentc"&gt;Hundreds of wildfires are torching huge swaths of Siberia after an unusually hot and dry summer left forests primed to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWpuVt"&gt;The blazes, likely ignited by lightning and strengthened by strong winds, have already burned more than &lt;a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/ywammg/over-15-thousand-square-miles-of-siberia-are-on-fire-and-its-a-global-ecological-catastrophe"&gt;15,000 square miles&lt;/a&gt;, an area larger than the state of Maryland. Though Siberia is sparsely populated — it’s home to just a quarter of Russia’s population — these blazes are alarmingly close to cities and are already impacting people’s health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVw8qG"&gt;Scientists at the &lt;a href="https://ksc.krasn.ru/en/news/scientists_have_shown_how_in_the_last_two_weeks_developed_fires_in_siberia/"&gt;Krasnoyarsk Science Center&lt;/a&gt; of the Russian Academy of Sciences mapped out the fires and found that their plumes have shrouded a massive area:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Forest fires in Siberia have shrouded large areas of Russia under aerosols. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JsLGWI"&gt;Residents of Novosibirsk, Russia’s third-largest city, located in southern Siberia, suffered from the poor air quality this week, which led to hacking coughs, stinging eyes, and hospital visits. The city of Ulan-Ude was also clouded by smoke. Dirty air stemming from blazes is often the &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=smoke.index"&gt;deadliest health effect of wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-health-effects-of-wildfire-smoke-may-last-a-lifetime/?verso=true"&gt;impacts can linger for years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Smoke from Siberian forest fires shrouds the Russian city of Ulan-Ude on August 1, 2019." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DOdGj4wxhJq2aR_Mu0pM99wpgio=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18408055/GettyImages_1158924078.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Hundreds of wildfires in Siberia have spread smoke over a massive area this week.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yK0xbz"&gt;And the smoke is no longer contained to Russia. &lt;a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/smoke-siberian-wildfires-reaches-western-us"&gt;NOAA satellites&lt;/a&gt; have observed that the massive plumes have moved east and into North America. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A NOAA map showing plumes from wildfires in Siberia reaching North America." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SVaS20St06g4_X8wmOmbJ9V8S74=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18400584/arison_index.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/smoke-siberian-wildfires-reaches-western-us" target="_blank"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Smoke plumes from Siberia’s fires have reached the western United States.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Sy09"&gt;Though wildfires are a regular event in Siberian forests, the scale of the current infernos is unusual. For some environmentalists, the biggest concern is that the soot from the fires can deposit on Arctic ice and speed up its melt rate. That in turn can cause major disruption to local ecosystems. And if that ice is on land, it can run into the ocean and contribute to sea level rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eKo9j"&gt;“The catastrophe in Siberia is not a catastrophe in Russia, it is a global ecological catastrophe,” Anton Beneslavsky, a Greenpeace Russia fire expert and volunteer firefighter, told &lt;a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/ywammg/over-15-thousand-square-miles-of-siberia-are-on-fire-and-its-a-global-ecological-catastrophe"&gt;Vice News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syHGOx"&gt;The Russian government &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31072019/siberia-arctic-wildfires-russia-state-emergency-climate-change-global-warming"&gt;declared an emergency&lt;/a&gt; and mobilized the military to contain the fires. Airplanes and helicopters are working to constrain the flames but can do little to limit the smoke. Many of the fires are in remote areas that are difficult to reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yh05Hr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The President instructed the Defence Ministry to assist in putting out the fires in Siberia &lt;a href="https://t.co/e3HdNOseFb"&gt;https://t.co/e3HdNOseFb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— President of Russia (@KremlinRussia_E) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KremlinRussia_E/status/1156605903745032192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 31, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RHop0Q"&gt;On Wednesday, President Trump spoke with Russian President &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/01/747196568/russia-says-trump-offered-to-help-putin-fight-forest-fires-in-siberia?utm_medium=RSS&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; to offer US assistance in fighting the fires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9KhQB"&gt;Fires are not unusual in Siberian forests, but the concern about this year’s blazes is their scale and their proximity to population centers. Siberia also saw massive fires &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-images-capture-worst-siberian-wildfires-in-10-000-years"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-images-capture-worst-siberian-wildfires-in-10-000-years"&gt;year before&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/2016/07/18/siberia-forest-fires-smoke-satellite/"&gt;year before that&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent fires were preceded by temperatures upward of 14 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the long-term average for the area. That fits within the pattern of what scientists expect as the global climate changes. As average temperatures rise, &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/heat-waves-and-climate-change-what-science-tells-us"&gt;heat waves&lt;/a&gt; are becoming longer, more frequent, and more intense. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Woodstock 50 was shaping up to be the next Fyre Fest. Now it’s been put out of its misery.</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Original Woodstock 50 poster" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4QOQylP1bQDnkZtAR7YAYDcMwgw=/67x0:1134x800/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64896831/woodstock.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;Arnold Skolnick&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The anniversary event is canceled after months of disastrous setbacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Kx8VtJ"&gt;In 1969, Woodstock seemed like America’s perfect salve. The &lt;a href="http://www.woodstockstory.com/woodstock1969.html"&gt;inaugural edition of the music festival&lt;/a&gt;, staged in the woods of upstate New York, brought together defining acts like Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Ravi Shankar, the Who, and Janis Joplin for “three days of peace and music,” as its iconic poster pledged. During the troubled summer of ’69, that was just what the country’s disillusioned 20-somethings needed — the festival took place not one full week after &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/20/16676426/charles-manson-dead-manson-family-murders-helter-skelter"&gt;the Manson murders&lt;/a&gt; left an irreversible black mark on American culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okiKxA"&gt;Fifty years later, Woodstock remains a legendary name in music, especially as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8381641/the-summer-music-festival-economy-explained"&gt;outdoor summer festivals&lt;/a&gt; dominate the industry landscape and continue to affirm the medium’s communal power. And a 2019 reprisal of Woodstock that’s similarly meant to unite diverse names in music seems like a logical idea to celebrate this landmark. That’s what the event’s original co-founder Michael Lang thought, anyway, when he announced an anniversary festival called Woodstock 50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9fNEO"&gt;But after months of behind-the-scenes turmoil, from legal accusations to financial woes, Woodstock 50 has been canceled. In a press release on July 31, Lang deemed it “impossible” to stage the event after its many missteps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJIFl9"&gt;“We are saddened that a series of unforeseen setbacks has made it impossible to put on the Festival we imagined with the great line-up we had booked and the social engagement we were anticipating,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/arts/music/woodstock-50-canceled.html"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJ9Chn"&gt;A note on &lt;a href="https://www.woodstock.com/"&gt;the Woodstock website&lt;/a&gt; adds that the organizers “thank all the artists, fans and partners who have stood by us in the face of great adversity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKpNcw"&gt;The festival’s cancellation isn’t a shock to those who have been following Woodstock 50’s myriad problems since the event was announced in January; this is not even the first time the festival has been canceled in the lead-up to its proposed August dates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRz4ib"&gt;Woodstock 50 was meant to recreate and commemorate the 1969 event, with Lang drawing parallels between the politically frustrated young people of today and those who attended the first Woodstock in &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iconic-woodstock-music--arts-festival-announces-the-official-50th-anniversary-celebration-300775567.html"&gt;his announcement&lt;/a&gt;. The event was to be held in Watkins Glen, New York, near the original festival’s location, from August 16 to 18. Things were on the up-and-up in March, when &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/woodstock-50-music-and-arts-fair-announces-massive-2019-lineup-more-than-80-performances-for-a-new-generation-of-festival-fans-300815146.html"&gt;Woodstock 50’s impressive lineup&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to include headliners like modern-day favorites like Jay-Z, the Killers, and Miley Cyrus (and &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6GsX9z2w2ErnRlRuJBSI0F?si=-JydpwG1Q-WyjMMu0dfMAQ"&gt;this writer’s&lt;/a&gt; personal favorite, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/soccer-mommy-indie-rocks-new-chill-but-kinda-sad-hero-253710/"&gt;Soccer Mommy&lt;/a&gt;), as well as throwback performers like Santana and the Zombies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbHY2h"&gt;But just one month later, in April, Woodstock 50’s financial partner Dentsu Aegis Network announced it was canceling the event. Citing an explosive budget, an underequipped venue, and safety concerns, &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/festivals/8509091/woodstock-50-festival-cancelled"&gt;Dentsu Aegis said that&lt;/a&gt; “despite our tremendous investment of time, effort and commitment, we don’t believe the production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the Woodstock Brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the artists, partners and attendees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRXkLL"&gt;What followed was a catastrophic series of events that saw Lang and the Woodstock organizers take Dentsu Aegis to court, arguing that the company violated its contract and had no right to cancel the event. (Lang used such words as “suffocate,” “kill,” and “treachery” in an infuriated letter to the company, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/woodstock-50-michael-lang-dentsu-832167/"&gt;Rolling Stone reported&lt;/a&gt;.) The &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/woodstock-50-prevails-in-court-300851282.html"&gt;court ruled in Woodstock 50’s favor,&lt;/a&gt; and Lang moved forward with the event — but Dentsu Aegis’s concerns about how much money the team had promised its booked artists upfront and the venue’s inability to hold the 100,000 attendees Lang intended to bring eventually proved warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxzzUd"&gt;Woodstock 50 continued to very publicly implode as it faced more and more issues in the weeks after its success in court. &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8510872/woodstock-50-infighting-delays-funding-michael-lang"&gt;Billboard reported&lt;/a&gt; in May that Lang had been repeatedly warned against trying to stage the festival in Watkins Glen, as it is difficult to acquire a health and safety permit for the location; Lang also failed to drum up the money necessary to secure the area. And by June, Watkins Glen had pulled out; &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/woodstock-50-loses-venue/"&gt;Woodstock 50 was without a venue&lt;/a&gt; or health permits. It also &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8510342/woodstock-50-michael-lang-raise-30m-by-friday-save-festival"&gt;lost its producer CID Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, which had already replaced the festival’s original producer, Superfly. An attempt to move the festival to Vernon Downs, New York, also failed, and it took Lang until July 25 to find a new venue: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-25/woodstock-50-festival-moves-to-maryland-in-bid-to-salvage-event"&gt;Merriweather Post Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, all the way down in Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfpmG9"&gt;But the biggest issue of all was that Woodstock 50’s glowing lineup was no longer attached. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/ap-source-jay-z-no-longer-performing-at-woodstock-50-show/2019/07/26/bd72e488-af9f-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.39327d86f283"&gt;Jay-Z canceled&lt;/a&gt; just one day after the new venue was announced, and Miley Cyrus &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/woodstock-50-one-day-event-common-akon-zombies-1203282632/"&gt;reportedly pulled out&lt;/a&gt; soon after; the rest of the acts also had the right of refusal to perform. One artist who canceled his performance, Country Joe McDonald, told &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bs-fe-woodstock50-20190729-o7tutfcxibcu7luk2jx7hvigcy-story.html"&gt;the Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt; that he wasn’t “interested in getting on a ship that’s sinking, and I don’t see any indication that this ship is not sinking” — which sums up how the majority of artists and potential attendees seemed to view the festival by that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oKRpgP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why are so many music festivals total disasters?","url":"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/6/11/18661203/music-festival-scams-failures-fyre-woodstock-panorama"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2j5fP0"&gt;To recap: Woodstock 50 was still set to take place on August 16, but three weeks ahead of showtime, it had no lineup, had just barely acquired a venue, and hadn’t even started selling tickets. The festival sounded like a glorious disaster in waiting, something akin to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/4/28/15435048/fyre-fest-explained-ja-rule-social-media-disaster"&gt;2017’s notoriously messy Fyre Festival&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sy25dd"&gt;Or perhaps a better antecedent is Woodstock ’99, the 30-year anniversary event that was the opposite of the original fest. Instead of peace, there was rampant nihilism in the form of riots and fights and sexual assault, set to a soundtrack of nu-metal stars like Limp Bizkit and Korn placed incongruently near Jewel and Sheryl Crow. Writes &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/was-woodstock-99-end-of-rock-863958/"&gt;Rolling Stone’s Brian Hiatt&lt;/a&gt; in retrospect: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ehw6qm"&gt;I went back into the riot, watching a group of kids trying to turn over a tractor trailer; they eventually succeeded, breaking someone’s leg in the process. I saw a creepy, silent line of cops in riot gear; I smelled enough ambient pepper spray to make my eyes tear. There was fire everywhere, distant screaming in all directions; it felt like the end of something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6IfeT7"&gt;Even the original Woodstock of 1969 didn’t go off without some serious hitches. It was &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120261/what-woodstock-1969-was-really"&gt;overwhelmed by torrential downpours&lt;/a&gt;, with rains so bad that electricians panicked about the possibility of mass electrocutions, what with all those cables and people around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsPof4"&gt;This all makes July 31’s cancellation feel like a sad inevitability. Lang’s unflagging dedication to staging the anniversary event remains intact, however, despite the seven months of turmoil and the amount of egg on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHBuBw"&gt;The plan is now to make Woodstock 50 a free benefit concert for HeadCount, the nonprofit that works to register concertgoers nationwide to vote, said Lang. That is, should anyone be willing to attend or perform. Perhaps we should still stay tuned in to 2019’s biggest disaster in live event planning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3wZiL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>About half of House Democrats now support opening an impeachment inquiry against Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the press conference podium holding up her index finger." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWr8L1J61Eiz5n3Byb_3YH9BzHk=/426x0:4606x3135/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63967170/1153884589.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;House speaker Nancy Pelosi answered questions and pushed back on the need for an impeachment inquiry during her weekly news conference at the US Capitol. | Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As speaker Pelosi makes the case against opening an impeachment inquiry, here are the House members who support it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="yjKn61"&gt;About half of the House Democratic caucus is now on record saying they support opening an &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/21/18634091/impeachment-inquiry-trump-pelosi"&gt;impeachment inquiry&lt;/a&gt; of President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sLOd4"&gt;The counts from various news outlets differ somewhat, but according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1156904818155413504?s=21"&gt;Politico’s latest tally&lt;/a&gt;, it’s now 118 of 235 House Democrats — just over half. On top of that, there’s also independent Rep. Justin Amash, who &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/5/20683110/justin-amash-leaves-gop-donald-trump-michigan"&gt;recently left the Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/democrats-impeachment-whip-list/index.html"&gt;CNN’s tally&lt;/a&gt;, though, is just under half — they count 116 Democrats supporting an inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2Jl0a"&gt;The counts are slightly different because Politico’s includes two members who have said they actually prefer not to move ahead on impeachment right now — &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2019/07/after-mueller-hearings-101-dems-back-trump-impeachment-inquiry-heres-how-nj-stands.html"&gt;Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.foxla.com/news/local-news/democratic-rep-karen-bass-not-time-to-impeach-president-trump-"&gt;Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA)&lt;/a&gt; — but who have also suggested that, if they were asked to vote on an impeachment inquiry, they would vote yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQoKFa"&gt;Bass has said that she doesn’t think it’s &lt;a href="http://www.foxla.com/news/local-news/democratic-rep-karen-bass-not-time-to-impeach-president-trump-"&gt;“the time”&lt;/a&gt; to impeach Trump, but would personally like to see him removed from office “immediately.” Pallone, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2019/07/after-mueller-hearings-101-dems-back-trump-impeachment-inquiry-heres-how-nj-stands.html"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; he thinks impeachment will be a “waste of time” because it will go “nowhere” in the Senate — but, since he thinks Trump is a “racist” who “obstructed justice,” he’d vote yes anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kokJGc"&gt;In any case, it’s clear that about half the House Democratic caucus now supports opening an impeachment inquiry at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HENpnO"&gt;Now, supporting an impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that these members of Congress would vote to impeach Trump (though many of them would). They support an inquiry on the topic. It’s proven a popular position because it sounds like an open-minded effort to get more facts, without committing to a final decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAOgVY"&gt;Supporters of an impeachment inquiry are still being met with resistance from speaker Nancy Pelosi. She’s offered &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/26/8930708/trump-impeachment-inquiry-pelosi-nadler"&gt;a variety of different reasons&lt;/a&gt; for her opposition to the move. But she likely believes (as most do) that there’s zero chance the Senate will remove Trump from office, and therefore fears a controversial impeachment vote would harm House Democrats representing districts that voted for Trump — something that could put her majority at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQJIXm"&gt;Currently, the House is in the midst of a lengthy recess. Members are back in their home districts and set to return to Washington in September. So watch the various Democratic members who aren’t yet on board with an inquiry — what they hear from their constituents when they’re back home this August could make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump announces tariffs on nearly all Chinese goods starting in September</title>
    <content type="html">  
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PS2igLtdXFLbIp-9GQx6jBcQJvg=/0x0:3797x2848/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64896773/1165378207.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;small&gt;President Donald Trump looks back at journalists at the White House July 31, 2019. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They will target toys, iPhones, clothing, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Osrb2D"&gt;President Donald Trump just announced that the US will place tariffs on nearly all Chinese products headed toward America next month — a decision that brings his &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/9/18/17790600/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-taiwan"&gt;trade war&lt;/a&gt; with Beijing to its most contentious point yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HziNFn"&gt;In a Thursday afternoon Twitter thread, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979443900067841"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; said his administration will put a 10 percent tax on $300 billion in Chinese goods starting September 1. That would encompass almost all of the remaining products the US has yet to place tariffs on, effectively meaning there will soon be no free trade between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R7Ka2"&gt;This means that for the first time, Chinese &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChadBown/status/1156983821063135234"&gt;toys, clothing, shoes, and consumer electronics&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/economy/new-china-tariffs-threat-trump/"&gt;iPhones&lt;/a&gt; will now face penalties. That will add to the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2019/5/10/18564295/trump-tariffs-us-china-trade-talks"&gt;25 percent tariffs on $250 billion&lt;/a&gt; worth of other Chinese products Trump announced in May, and could potentially lead to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2019/08/01/trump-says-he-will-impose-new-tariffs-on-300-billion-in-chinese-imports-starting-next-month-ending-brief-ceasefire-in-trade-war/?utm_term=.537797abc5aa&amp;amp;wpisrc=al_news__alert-economy--alert-politics--alert-national&amp;amp;wpmk=1"&gt;higher prices for Americans to pay&lt;/a&gt; for these goods later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SVlls"&gt;The reason for the president’s newest decision, he explained in his tweets, is that the US and China have not yet been able to reach a much sought-after bilateral trade deal. What’s more, the president said, Beijing has not lived up to its promises of buying more American agricultural goods or stopping the export of &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/7/27/16049840/fentanyl-opioid-epidemic-worse"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt; — a drug fueling the opioid crisis — into the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usLYN9"&gt;As a result, the president felt compelled to punish China further, despite the fact that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping remain &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979445565202433"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt;. That relationship may explain why the president is still open to more negotiations with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiXr8A"&gt;“We look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive Trade Deal, and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979450560548864"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i0Ljqm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;...We look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive Trade Deal, and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!&lt;/p&gt;— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979450560548864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tx2FfK"&gt;While trade experts expected this announcement — the administration has teased it since the beginning of the trade war — few are happy that the day has actually come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwwSAb"&gt;“However unfortunate, President Trump’s next round of tariffs come as no surprise,” the Peterson Institute for International Economics’s Chad Bown told me. “All along, he has shown a lack of concern over the implications of his trade war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qWA4cw"&gt;This was always the likely outcome of Trump’s China strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BDVXfK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/9/18/17790600/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-taiwan"&gt;Trump administration’s China strategy&lt;/a&gt;, current and former senior administration officials told me last year, is effectively to crash the Chinese economy. Placing tariffs will not only make the country’s products more expensive for Americans to buy, but will also induce multinational corporations to move their manufacturing plants and offices to other nearby countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtqJTt"&gt;So while Trump wants to make a deal with Xi — partly to end China’s theft of American intellectual property and other aggressive trade practices — he’ll settle for destroying China’s economy in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZWGlu"&gt;Still, the US and China have been negotiating for months in efforts to strike an agreement. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were in Shanghai this week specifically to meet with their counterparts. However, they didn’t sign an accord, though they promised to talk again next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThrKyb"&gt;The failure to reach a deal is not all the administration’s fault, though. Multiple outlets &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/china-backtracked-on-nearly-all-aspects-of-us-trade-deal-sources.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that China had abruptly backed &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/china-backtracked-on-nearly-all-aspects-of-us-trade-deal-sources.html"&gt;away from huge chunks&lt;/a&gt; of a 150-page agreement in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/08/us-prepares-to-raise-china-trade-tariffs"&gt;making changes and reneging on commitments throughout the entire document&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y95Ok"&gt;That action continues to bother the president. “We thought we had a deal with China three months ago, but sadly, China decided to re-negotiate the deal prior to signing,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979443900067841"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk9qHR"&gt;While Washington and Beijing may be closer to signing an accord than at the start of the process, then, they’re still not close to putting pen to paper. Which means the US-China trade relationship will have to endure even more tariffs for months to come — further imperiling the two countries’ ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Phwl6R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7EPzR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
