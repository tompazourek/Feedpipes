								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Electrolytes are naturally occurring chemical compounds that play a crucial role in human physiology because of their ability to carry an electrical charge.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Biologically speaking, electrolytes contribute to a wide variety of vital processes because they separate into positively and negatively charged ions when dissolved in a polar solvent like water. These ions, in turn, help our muscles contract, the synapses in our brain fire, and our hearts beat because these functions are largely dependent on the proper exchange of positively and negatively charged ions in and out of cells.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The body’s principal electrolytes include calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, phosphate, and chloride, each of which has a vitally important—and sometimes parallel—physiological function.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Calcium</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; helps regulate blood pressure, contract muscles, convey nerve signals, and develop and maintain bones. Calcium imbalances can cause bone pain, irregular heartbeat, kidney stones, fractures, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Magnesium</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; helps maintain proper heart rhythm, contract muscles, balance the ratio of fluids and proteins in the body, and even regulate mental health. Magnesium imbalances can lead to insomnia, other mental disturbances, and anxiety.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Potassium</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; helps stabilize blood pressure and control heart beat. Too low or too high potassium can cause muscle spasms, cramps, constipation, and sleep disturbances.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Sodium</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; helps maintain the body’s balance of fluids, contract muscles, and convey nerve signals. An imbalance in your body’s sodium levels can cause cramps, nausea, and diarrhea.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Chloride</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; helps maintain a proper balance of the body’s fluids. Chloride imbalances can cause vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and trouble breathing.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While all of the above-listed electrolytes are important, I will primarily focus on sodium, magnesium, and potassium in this article, since they’re the three electrolytes in which most people are generally deficient.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of their wide-ranging physiological importance, electrolyte deficiencies or imbalances can have very serious consequences, ranging from fatigue and muscle cramps to death. In fact, electrolytes are so important that an injection of the right amount of potassium can stop the heart dead in its tracks!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Symptoms of Electrolyte Imbalance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Generally speaking, minor electrolyte imbalances are not very symptomatic. Most people can display no symptoms and still have slightly elevated or diminished levels of most electrolytes on a blood test.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if an electrolyte imbalance escalates to the point that it becomes significant, it can be deadly. Because electrolytes play such critical roles in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, many of the symptoms of imbalance or depletion affect these same parts of the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In most cases, you will know there is something wrong because you will feel absolutely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">awful</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The most common symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance include muscle cramps, anxiety, headaches, insomnia, flu-like symptoms, digestive issues, confusion or brain fog, joint pain, fatigue, and dizziness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, these symptoms will generally abate if an imbalance is caught and managed early; however, if it goes untreated, an electrolyte imbalance can cause serious long-term problems, including bone mineral loss (osteoporosis) and irreversible heart and brain damage.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">Causes of Electrolyte Imbalance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We absorb electrolytes through the foods we eat and the fluids we drink, and lose them through exercise, sweating, and expelling bodily waste.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An electrolyte imbalance occurs when we have too much or too little of a given electrolyte, a fact that highlights the importance of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ratio</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of these nutrients in the body. Electrolyte levels can get out of whack when we do not consume enough of a given electrolyte to start, or when we do not take in enough to replace that which is being lost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There a variety of factors that can precipitate an electrolyte imbalance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, an imbalance can occur if you do not consume a well-rounded diet capable of providing you with enough mineral electrolytes, or if you have gut issues that lead to your body absorbing too few nutrients from the food you eat. You can also experience an electrolyte imbalance if you are very sick and purging fluids—and, by extension, electrolytes—as a result of severe vomiting, diarrhea, or high fever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to acute illness, chronic conditions like endocrine or hormonal disorders, cancer, kidney disease, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) can lead to electrolyte imbalances as these conditions or their treatments all, in one way or the other, cause the body to purge electrolytes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly enough, one of the more common causes of electrolyte imbalance I encounter is from an otherwise seemingly healthy undertaking: the ketogenic diet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This low carb, high healthy fat diet wreaks havoc on your body’s electrolyte levels in two ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, the diet causes a precipitous drop in daily sodium intake essentially overnight by removing processed and unhealthy foods that are chock full of salt from your daily menu. If you don’t intentionally replace these now-missing electrolytes, you are just about guaranteed to experience the dreaded “</span><a href="https://robbwolf.com/2019/06/05/the-keto-flu-symptoms-remedies-and-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400">keto flu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second, the ketogenic diet is diuretic in nature. Cutting carbohydrates causes insulin levels to drop, and the sudden drop in insulin triggers the kidneys to release water and electrolytes through increased urine production.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400">How Much is Enough?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While all electrolytes play an important role in the body’s functioning, sodium, potassium, and magnesium are my primary focus today.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While many people include calcium when discussing proper electrolyte consumption, the scientific literature has largely agreed on the point that most people get enough calcium from dietary sources, and over </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4125316/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400">supplementing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> can have very serious side effects. Therefore, I generally leave calcium off my hit list of the most important electrolytes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is important to remember that our consumption of these nutrients needs to be properly balanced against one another to ensure we do not drive ourselves into an electrolyte imbalance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In general, you should be consuming 5,000mg of sodium; 1,000mg of potassium, ideally in the form of potassium chloride or potassium citrate; and 300mg of magnesium, preferably in the form of magnesium malate every day, in addition to what you get from dietary sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Be aware that, these are generic ranges&#8230; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> exact level of optimal electrolyte intake is a multifactorial question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things like your age, body mass, daily activity level, the presence of any electrolyte-purging comorbidities, and even where you live can all impact the level of electrolytes that you should consume each day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if you can relate to any of the symptoms described above, there is a good chance your electrolytes are out of balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So what can you do? I’m glad you asked!</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b><i>Don’t</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Reach for a Standard Sports Drink</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think anyone should </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ever</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> consume the sugary sports drinks that line the shelves of your average grocery store or corner bodega.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the electrolyte-replacement products on the market today, ironically, do not contain sufficient levels of key electrolytes and are just packed with sugar. It’s best to ignore the catchy marketing campaigns, famous athletes’ endorsement deals, and the sponsorships at sporting events big and small—these drinks are not your friend and should be avoided at all costs!</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"> Tweak Your Diet</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minor electrolyte imbalances can generally be corrected by focusing on optimizing the foods you consume on a daily basis. Ensuring your diet is filled with unpackaged, whole foods that deliver a healthy dose of essential nutrients, including electrolytes, can go a long way towards reversing an electrolyte imbalance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above-ground leafy vegetables like broccoli and cabbage, bananas, and avocados are rich in potassium and magnesium, while beans and probiotic dairy are a great source of calcium.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400"> Supplement Electrolytes</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you can’t indulge in a mainstream sports drink, where should you turn to supplement electrolytes? I asked myself this very same question and answering it led me to be shoulder deep in my pantry mixing up homebrew electrolyte concoctions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a ton of trial and error, I developed a couple of great do-it-yourself drink recipes for anyone who wants to follow my lead and mix up their own. If you’d like to dive into some of my favorite recipes, you can download them </span><a href="https://drinklmnt.com/homemade-electrolyte-recipe-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, if you’d prefer to learn from the mistakes I made over years tinkering with these recipes—and trust me, there were a few!—you can give </span><a href="https://drinklmnt.com/pages/robb-wolf?utm_source=RobbWolf&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=CLEAN_ELECTROLYTES&amp;utm_content=ELECTROLYTE_IMBALANCE_SYMPTOMS_FIX_IT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400">LMNT Recharge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a try. I’ve worked really hard to develop this electrolyte drink mix and it’s precisely formulated to deliver all of the electrolytes you need and none of the extra junk that you don’t. And if I can so say myself, it’s quite tasty!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing that is important to keep in mind: whether they are the result of dietary issues or another underlying condition, electrolyte imbalances are very serious business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you think you may be suffering from a severe electrolyte imbalance, you should consult your healthcare provider immediately. They can help you determine the extent of any imbalance with a metabolic panel and help craft a plan to get you back on the right track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once you know which electrolytes are out of whack and what is driving the imbalance, you can incorporate some of these suggestions to supplement the plan you develop with your physician. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/J44JLqCw9vo">Fitbit Sleep Tracking </a></b>[1:35]</p>
<p>Jay says:</p>
<p>G&#8217;Day Robb, love your work. I took a break from your podcast to learn computer programming and am now back because I&#8217;m stressed and my desk bound body is broken. Glad to be back and see you&#8217;ve figured out your keto problems when bonking during class. I&#8217;ve signed up to your keto master class so fingers crossed.</p>
<p>I have a somewhat basic question about sleep.</p>
<p>My Fitbit says I slept 7 hours with 1 hour awake. I don&#8217;t remember waking and there are up to 30 a night of these tiny &#8216;awake&#8217; periods. I do sometimes toss and turn to get into comfortable positions. My partner says I&#8217;m asleep within minutes of hitting the pillow. So I think I&#8217;m sleeping ok.</p>
<p>Should I think about this as 8 hours sleep or 7? I tend to wake up energised when my Fitbit says 6hrs 30 mins + 1 hour awake&#8230;. So thinking this is equivalent to standard 7-8 hours per night. When I push for Fitbit to say 8 hours then I&#8217;m very lethargic when I wake. But it&#8217;s probably then like 9 hours which could be &#8216;over sleeping&#8217; for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, love the work you two are doing. I miss the Q&amp;As with Greg but love the new format.</p>
<p>Anyway, fangirling from Australia. My question can probably be answered by Google but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be able to cut through the interjunks.</p>
<p>All the best &#8211; Jay</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/9vWpov5VNaA">Palate Fatigue &amp; Food Burnout </a></b>[8:11]</p>
<p>Maria says:</p>
<p>Hi, Robb and Nikki, I was wondering if you can address palate fatigue. For some reason, I tend to be the kind of person that needs to have a lot of something and then don’t want it anymore and have to switch. Before, I was into avocados and sardines, all the time, and now it is eggs and bacon. It is almost as if my body is asking for these foods at certain times. Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/pmZUE3vIgiM">Protein Toxicity and the Carnivore Diet </a></b>[12:22]</p>
<p>Jesse says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb,</p>
<p>In WTE you briefly mention (p. 27) that humans cannot consume more than 35% of their calories from protein before suffering from protein toxicity. The carnivore diet has recently gotten some publicity and seems to have some anecdotal success for folks with stubborn autoimmunity issues. Do you think following a carnivorous diet carries a high risk of suffering from protein toxicity? And would we be able to look for evidence of protein toxicity in kidney function testing?</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Jesse</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/NPdotrdf9FI">Waking Up From Hunger While In Ketosis </a></b>[17:55]</p>
<p>Justin says:</p>
<p>Dear Robb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of the pod and your work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the past two months, I&#8217;ve been following a keto eating plan (I weigh all food and track macros &#8211; I&#8217;m usually hitting 40g net carbs, 90-100g protein, and somewhere between 235g-270g fat, for a total of roughly 3,000-3,500 calories per day).&nbsp; I&#8217;m a 30 y/o male, 5&#8217;9. I usually eat 3-4 meals/day with no snacks. I currently weigh 156lb and am about 16% body fat (I did a BodPod when I was a few pounds lighter and was at 14.5%). In terms of exercise, I usually go to the gym 3x/week and do some combination of squats, deadlifts, press, and bench press.&nbsp; As an example of where I&#8217;m currently at with strength, I do 4 sets of 5 repetitions (2 min rest periods) 205 pounds on squats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is this: when I try to cut calories down by 300-500 (I&#8217;d like to get to 12% body fat), I wake up in the middle of the night hungry.&nbsp; I feel like I keep hearing on various podcasts and books that I read that in a state of keto, hunger should be significantly blunted and this shouldn&#8217;t really be an issue.&nbsp; But I feel like if I don&#8217;t go to sleep pretty full, I wake up in the middle of the night. I know sleep is critically important, so this seems like a problem. If I eat enough to sleep through the night, I can maintain the same weight but really struggle to lose weight.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve done self-experiments to make sure I&#8217;m not waking up due to stress, noise, etc., and have isolated that my sleep is almost completely correlated with my hunger levels. I wanted to ask for your guidance because I imagine other people might struggle with a similar issue &#8211; I know many people who do well with hunger during the day, but not so well at night.&nbsp; Some things I&#8217;ve wondered about is if I&#8217;m overtraining or if there&#8217;s some sort of other physiological issue I need to attend to. Maybe I&#8217;m not understanding keto properly, but I feel like with my macro breakdown I should be able to comfortably go 12-16 hours without eating? Or, is the ability to go prolonged periods without food less about eating and more about individual differences?</p>
<p>Thanks for all of the amazing work that you do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brett says:</p>
<p>Hi. Robb and Nicki&#8230;</p>
<p>Fasting for overweight or normal weight people has been well covered. Is there any benefit to underweight guys fasting in an effort to add mass? I’m 6’3” and 165lbs, 37 years old. I can eat whatever I want in whatever quantities I want and my weight never changes. I would like to be heavier. I’ve tried weight programs and I tone up ok but it’s rare to add more than 5lbs. The minute I stop the program I’m instantly back to 165. Everything else you always talk about like diet, sleep, stress is already dialed in</p>

<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Well, howdy, wife, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I&#8217;m great. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Good. It&#8217;s a quiet house.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> It is. The kids are swimming.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The dog is-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> The dog-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> At grandpa&#8217;s house.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> At grandpa&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We&#8217;re alone.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Man, we&#8217;re home alone, and we&#8217;re podcasting instead of doing naughty things. Geez. What&#8217;s up with us? Anything new or &#8230; This may be the last podcast we do from Reno?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I think we&#8217;re going to try to get another-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Might sneak in one more?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> One or two, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay, oh yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> All righty. So, anything else you want to update people on, or we just jump right in to &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I think we&#8217;re jumping in.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The good stuff, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Let&#8217;s see. We have a question on Fitbit sleep tracking from Jay. He says, &#8220;G&#8217;day, Rob. G&#8217;day, G&#8217;day, Rob, love your work. I took a break from your podcast to learn computer programming and am now back because I&#8217;m stressed and my desk bound body is broken. Glad to be back and see you figured out your Keto problems when bonking during class. I&#8217;ve signed up to your Keto master class, so fingers crossed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> That sentence didn&#8217;t really quite make sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> He&#8217;s Australian, I mean English is a second language so yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;I have a somewhat basic question about sleep. My Fitbit says I slept seven hours with one hour awake. I don&#8217;t remember waking and there are up 30 a night of these tiny awake periods. I do sometimes toss and turn to get into comfortable positions. My partner says I&#8217;m asleep within minutes of hitting the pillow, so I think I&#8217;m sleeping okay. Should I think about this as eight hours of sleep or seven? I tend to wake up energized when my Fitbit says six hours and thirty minutes plus one hour awake. So, thinking this is equivalent to a standard seven to eight hours per night.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> When I push for Fitbit to say eight hours then I&#8217;m very lethargic when I wake but it&#8217;s probably then like nine hours, which could be oversleeping for me. Anyway, love the work you two are doing and miss the Q&amp;A&#8217;s with Greg.&#8221; I miss Greg too.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We need to spend more time with Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We do.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We should just have a Greg guest retrospective-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We should.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Just get him on the show, Q&amp;A fired at Greg and just shoot the breeze.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We should.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Let&#8217;s definitely do that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay, &#8220;But love the new format. Anyway, fangirling from Australia. My question can probably be answered by Google, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be able to cut through the inter-junks. All the best, Jay.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Well, Google might have banned the information at this point. You never really know, but you know, this is interesting stuff, and I&#8217;ve used a number of wearables like Oura Ring, Fitbit. I dig all of them. All of them are really cool and at the end of the day, all of them made me a little bit crazy and I ended up discontinuing using them.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And, one of the things that made me the craziest was the sleep piece because it just didn&#8217;t really matter what else in the rest of my life that I did, it always said that my sleep was kind of marginal, my HRV was kind of like, &#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re kind of ready but not really ready.&#8221; I had a real problem with sleep latency because I&#8217;ll get in bed and read and it would-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, it was like it was tracking, it was saying that you had a &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, difficulty falling asleep and so I would take-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> But you were awake reading.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right. Right, so I&#8217;ve just found some challenges with this stuff and I think this is where &#8230; And, Jay lays it out pretty well. If you&#8217;re feeling good, you know, I think that these wearables are really beneficial for establishing a baseline, and then if something changes, good or bad, then we can kind of look at that as a little bit of a compass guidepost, but at some point it&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re drowning in information and I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s doing you more good, because it just kind of is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And, Tyler Cartwright shared an article with us about some sort of study that was done where people who are tracking sleep, I don&#8217;t remember if it mentioned the specific device, but there&#8217;s like a placebo effect. So, if you wake and your thing says that you&#8217;ve slept like crap then people tended to feel &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Worse.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Worse.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Even if-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I remember that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And, so it was basically saying because some of this technology is not as refined or as &#8230; If it&#8217;s not actually reporting accurately, it could be causing you to feel worse even though maybe you slept fine.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Just fine, yeah. That&#8217;s what the researchers did is they were doing an actual sleep study, which is much more involved. And so, they would actually send them sometimes false information on the day when they &#8230; And then, conversely, on days when they actually kind of slept like shit, they would say, &#8220;You&#8217;re ready to go, Tiger.&#8221; And the person was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m ready to go.&#8221; You know?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And, so, this is where some of this stuff, it&#8217;s just &#8230; We&#8217;re kind of drowning in information, and I think to some degree just waking up and looking around and like, &#8220;Ah, how do I feel today?&#8221; And you go poo and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, that was formed and I didn&#8217;t need like an armload of toilet paper.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Like, these kind of pretty objective metrics of just feeling are rather powerful. It&#8217;s reminiscent, it&#8217;s an old book at this point, but Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. He went into great detail talking about how though even though we&#8217;ve increased the information we have, like looking at MRIs and stuff like that, we have all this additional information. And we were just talking to our friend, Dr. Jim Greenwald, the other day who&#8217;s a retired orthopedic surgeon. He feels like MRIs have pushed orthopedic surgery backwards and there&#8217;s a whole host of reasons why, but the information that one obtains from a really thorough physical, according to Dr. Greenwald, and just listening to the patient, tells you so much about what&#8217;s going on and like, is surgery really an option, let&#8217;s do all this physical therapy and stretching and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But it&#8217;s virtually everything on an MRI that&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yep, you&#8217;ve got some sort of pathology.&#8221; You know? Because we just get down so granular, but it&#8217;s not actually better informing what we&#8217;re doing, and I think that there&#8217;s a certain element of this with the wearables scene, which &#8230; Well, probably somebody will want to hang me out to dry because these wearable companies make a ton of money and I do think that they have great application. I think that more, if you&#8217;re really burning the candle at both ends, like if I had something like this in my 20&#8217;s, it would&#8217;ve probably been good, because I was trying to murder myself with exercise and short sleep and everything.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That would have been a really beneficial thing for me, I think, getting that objective feedback of, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;ve got three reds in a row, you&#8217;ve got to slow down.&#8221; But I know that was probably like the longest answer to something that could have been rather concise. Getting back to this, but I think, Jay, I wouldn&#8217;t worry what the hours are. I would just, if you enjoy wearing it, use it as a baseline, then that way if anything changes, then you can always refer back to the baseline but then beyond that, how do you look, how do you feel, how do you perform? I think those are really powerful metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right. Our next question is from Maria on pallet fatigue. &#8220;Hi Robb and Nicki, I was wondering if you can address pallet fatigue? For some reason I tend to be the kind of person that needs to have a lot of something and then I don&#8217;t want it anymore and have to switch. Before, I was in to avocados and sardines all the time and now it is eggs and bacon. It&#8217;s almost as if my body is asking for these foods at certain times. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, good question. Pallet fatigue is different. This is almost like, it sounds like burning out.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Burning out, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Out, on stuff, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Eating it too much.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Man I-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You did it with sardines.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I did it with sardines. Man, I used to love sardines and then there was just one day &#8230; I think&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You were eating them for breakfast, you would have them in your backpack, you&#8217;d take them in your office.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I had sardines. Breakfast and lunch and traveling and everything. I think I got a can that was off one time, and I was kind of sick from it, or my body finally &#8230; I need to be hungry to eat sardines at this point, or I need to do magic in dressing them up.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But pallet fatigue really has to do with the &#8230; A meal kind of experience. So, if you&#8217;re eating a lot of something, then eventually, even it&#8217;s a very good something, you will get bored of it, and this is the sensory specific pallet fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> At the one sitting.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> At that one sitting. And this is where if we have food that is wide in variety of textures and flavors and scents and whatnot, then we can override that pallet fatigue signal. Interestingly, we just had a person reach out to me, have not been able to talk to her yet, but she used to work for the biggest food manufacturers around developing seasoning strategies and pallet fatigue bypassing algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, there&#8217;s actual computer algorithms for figuring out how to make food more addictive. And this is, not to drag this out into the weeds, but this is some of the stuff that makes me a little crazy with the Layne Norton&#8217;s, the Alan Aragon folks. They do some good work, but they will get into a pissing match about this study says that fructose is not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> It&#8217;s like, okay. We have some people out there that are misrepresenting the metabolic consequences of fructose. Check. Great. You guys have set us straight on that. Now, what does this mean and what is the relevance there when we&#8217;re talking about people eating processed food? People don&#8217;t sit and eat plain fructose. They eat these highly complex, super engineered flavor combinations that no joke &#8230; It was fascinating. This email is fascinating. We&#8217;re going to have, even though I&#8217;m not really doing much in the way of interviews anymore, I&#8217;m going to do some interviews in the future, and this gal is going to be one of them, where she&#8217;s like, &#8220;You were bang on with Wired to Eat. Like, there is a really highly refined understanding, like the Doritos roulette example that I&#8217;ve talked about. There&#8217;s a super high, refined understanding about how to engineer foods to be hyper-palatable and effectively addictive. And having pissing matches about that. Like, fructose versus this versus that, and ignoring this topic of palate fatigue and how you can bypass that is really missing the boat for people. And man, I don&#8217;t know if my salty palmer is kicking in or what.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That was about as far a field from what Maria had asked. But Maria, again, palate fatigue &#8230; This sounds like she&#8217;s just experienced some burnout.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So, she&#8217;s just wondering if she&#8217;s just burning out. She&#8217;s eating the same thing for too much and &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And is her body asking for these foods or she&#8217;s just &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I don&#8217;t know, man.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Reaching a-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> My body would tell me to ask for cookie dough ice cream all the time. So, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe. Some of that stuff, it &#8230; People are like, &#8220;The innate wisdom of the body.&#8221; And you know, sometimes it&#8217;s like, oh, I just want a piece of fruit. And so, I don&#8217;t know. Maybe that&#8217;s the innate wisdom of body. But more often than not, it&#8217;s kind of like, man that Twix. Or, you know, [inaudible 00:11:22] be pretty amazing. So, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But you can absolutely burn yourself out on something.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> On &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Too much. All right. Our next question is from Jessie on protein toxicity and the carnivore diet. &#8220;Robb, in Wired to Eat, you briefly mention on page 27 that humans can not consume more than 35% of their calories from protein before suffering from protein toxicity. The carnivore diet has recently gotten some publicity, and seems to have some anecdotal success for folks with stubborn autoimmunity issues. Do you think following a carnivorous diet carries a high risk of suffering from protein toxicity, and would we be able to look for evidence of protein toxicity in kidney function testing?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, I&#8217;ll answer the last one first. The protein toxicity is not a kidney issue. It&#8217;s a liver issue. It&#8217;s you need substrates other than protein to deal with the ammonia and nitrogen-based bi-products of protein metabolism. And in general, humans seem to hit about 35, maybe some populations as high as 40% of their total calories can come from protein, and then beyond that, we have rabbit starvation. You were reading a book that was talking about [crosstalk 00:12:40].</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We called it trout starvation.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Trout starvation, which I had never heard of.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I&#8217;m blanking on the book, but yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Similar deal where people were eating exceptionally lean proteins and ultimately ending up with problems, because they had no other substrates in their &#8230; It would be hard as hell to do this, because the experience of protein toxicity is very uncomfortable, and the main desire that you have is to eat something other than protein. The only reason why people get into these scenarios is that they literally have no other options or-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> In the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah. And-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And isn&#8217;t it because those types of things like rabbits and trout are very-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Very lean.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Lean proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah. And so, even if you were to eat something like rabbit or trout, that&#8217;s why you eat the brains and the innards, and you know, you&#8217;re trying to just get every little bit of fat out of them, and what not. And so, I&#8217;m a fan of the carnivore diet. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the first place for everybody to start, but man. The results that people are getting in this kind of autoimmune scene are really impressive. And so, I&#8217;m optimistic about where this will go. I would actually not be surprised at all if some iteration of a carnivore intervention ends up proving to be more efficacious than autoimmune paleo, and I&#8217;m the person who came up with the term autoimmune paleo. I&#8217;m the first person to write about it, publish it in a book, and really coin the term.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, you know, as much as AIP has helped people, I would not be surprised if carnivore ends up befitting more people when it&#8217;s all said and done, for a whole host of reasons. But someone would just need to be in very difficult situation to induce a state of protein toxicity.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Well, because people on the carnivore diet are eating rib eyes, and they have lots of fat, and-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Other cuts of meat that there&#8217;s a significant amount of fat in there.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Or &#8230; And or they&#8217;re adding some additional fat to it, and stuff like that, so yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So, because of that, they&#8217;re not hitting this-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> They&#8217;re &#8230; When you do kind of a breakdown, usually people are right at 30 to 35% of calories from protein, yeah. And this is one of the interesting things, like the Inuit, some of their gene alterations. Like, they don&#8217;t really generally enter ketosis. They seem to more directly mobilize fatty acids. But it&#8217;s an interesting adaptation, even though the Inuit are held us as an example of ketogenic culture. Biology decided that it was more efficacious, more survival advantage to create these gene alterations that there&#8217;s actually a very high infant mortality rate from low blood sugar. You know, in that very early period right after birth, which most babies are in ketosis, but different arctic-based populations may not even be able to enter that. But the two adaptations that they seem to be better at, their protein threshold may be as high as like 40 to 45%. So, there may be a couple of percentage points higher on the ability to handle protein.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And then also, in lieu of producing ketone bodies, they&#8217;re better at direct mobilization of fatty acids for energy. So, it&#8217;s an interesting adaption. Even Loren Cordain&#8217;s early work kind of suggested that human &#8230; Maybe the default mode for humans is kind of bumping up against that protein threshold consistently. And it&#8217;s just because there&#8217;s all kinds of, you know, mythology around this stuff. And yes, humans ancestrally were big game hunters and bigger game was fatter, but there&#8217;s kind of a reality that &#8230; I&#8217;ve actually lived as a hunter gatherer for a period of time, you know? And it&#8217;s like &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki: </strong>Eight days. Start. 10 days.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Fucking calories are hard to come by, you know? And you eat kind of whatever you can get your hands on, and yeah. I don&#8217;t want to belabor that too much.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I just remember picking you up from the airport and you did not look like my husband. You were so skinny.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Dude, I was skinny. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> It was only like 10 days since I dropped you off, and you were emaciated.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> 20 pounds lighter. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All righty. Our next question is from Justin. &#8220;Waking up from hunger while in ketosis. Dear Rob, I&#8217;m a huge fan of the pod and your work. For the past few months, I&#8217;ve been following a keto eating plan. I weigh all food and track macros, and I&#8217;m usually hitting 40 grams of net carbs, 90 to 100 grams of protein, and somewhere between 235 to 270 grams of fat for a total of roughly 3000 to 3500 calories per day. I&#8217;m a 30 year old male, 5 foot nine. I usually eat three to four meals per day with no snacks. I currently weigh 156, and I&#8217;m about 16% body fat. I did a bod pod when I was a few pounds later and was at 14.5%. In terms of exercise, I usually go to the gym three times a week and do some combination of squats, deadlift press, and bench press. As an example of where I am currently at with strength, I do four sets of five reps, two minute rest periods, with 205 pounds on squats.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So, my question is this. When I try to cut calories down by about three to 500 calories, because I&#8217;d like to get to 12% body fat, I wake up in the middle of the night hungry. I feel like I keep hearing on various podcasts and books that I read that in a state of keto, hunger should be significantly blunted, and this shouldn&#8217;t really be an issue. But I feel like if I don&#8217;t go to sleep pretty full, I wake up in the middle of the night. I know sleep is critically important, so this seems like a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> If I eat enough to sleep through the night, I can maintain the same weight but really struggle to lose weight. I&#8217;ve done self experiments to make sure I&#8217;m not waking up due to stress, noise, et cetera, and have isolated that my sleep is almost completely correlated with my hunger levels. I wanted to ask for your guidance, because I imagine other people might struggle with a similar issue. I know many people who do well with hunger during the day, but not so well at night. Some things I&#8217;ve wondered about is if I&#8217;m over-training, or if there&#8217;s some sort of other physiological issue I need to attend to. Maybe I&#8217;m not understanding keto properly, but I feel like with my macro breakdown, I should be able to comfortably go 12 to 16 hours without eating. Or is the ability to go prolonged periods without food less about eating and more about individual differences? Thank you for all the amazing work that you do. Justin.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Man. Lot of good stuff in there. One thing that leaps out to me is the 90 to 100 grams of protein I think is way to low.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> For 100-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I mean, I am more like 120 grams of protein, and-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I&#8217;m smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, that definitely leaps out at me, and some very smart people, far smarter than myself, ranging from Paul Jaminet to Chris Masterjohn, have noted, and they really get in the biochemistry at a pretty high level, so you could do some following up on this, but they make the case that if you&#8217;re reasonably active and keto, and they&#8217;ll make the case that you shouldn&#8217;t be keto if you&#8217;re reasonably active. So, that&#8217;s a whole other aside. But they make the case that if you&#8217;re going to be active and you&#8217;re going to be keto, you need more protein. And that&#8217;s just alpha omega, done.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We&#8217;ve seen with keto gains, we&#8217;ve seen with the carnivore diet, which we were just kind of talking about in the previous question a little bit, when people eat at higher protein levels, they do then tend to get better satiety, and there also tends to be more of a ability to recover from training and stuff like that. Part of what&#8217;s going on, and one of the benefits that&#8217;s interesting, is glycogen can be restored, liver in and muscle glycogen can and will be restored from protein breakdowns in many corners of the keto-sphere, people are terrified by that. And if you have epilepsy, if you&#8217;re using keto as a cancer adjuvant or something like that, then there&#8217;s reason for it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> For body composition and weight loss, it&#8217;s a disastrous deal to drop protein, because people end up hungry, and then they need to eat a lot of either fat or carbs. And it&#8217;s very easy to overeat.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Because I feel like 3000 to 3500 calories is also high for-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Correct.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> A five foot nine-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> 156 pound guy. So, if he upped his protein significantly, his fat would probably come down a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, I would get the protein up to at least 150 grams per day, and &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Maybe plug your numbers into the keto gains macro nutrient calculator-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. And select&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And see what that spits out.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> For the recommended level, and maybe &#8230; So, if you use the keto gains macro nutrient calculator, it will default to .8 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass, or you can toggle use keto gains recommended, which is 1.0 grams per pound of lean body mass, and/or you could adjust it for 1.2 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass. I would tweak it to the 1.2 grams. So, I would up your protein, and adjust all the other macros appropriately based off the &#8230; What that spits out. I would also make really certain that you&#8217;re getting adequate electrolytes. Shameless plug for Element, but this is another one of those things that if the electrolyte balance is off and sodium is too low-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You can be hungry.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> You can be hungry, you can get an adrenocortical response. So, those are the two big things that I would really look at is upping protein and really weighing and measuring your electrolytes. Tracking it in MyFitnessPal or something like that to make certain that you&#8217;re at least getting five grams of sodium per day. And then if you&#8217;re eating largely whole, unprocessed foods, the magnesium and potassium should take care of itself. But I&#8217;ll be kind of shocked if you don&#8217;t see improvements off that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But if you don&#8217;t, it could also be a case where keto is just not a good fit. Maybe a little bit of carbs in the mix would be a better option.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. So, Justin, please let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, let us know. Follow up on that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Try that, up the protein, and then let us know how you do. Okay, our final question for this week is from Brett, and his question is on fasting for skinny dudes. &#8220;Hi Robb and Nicki. Fasting for overweight or normal people has been well covered. Is there any benefit to underweight guys fasting in an effort to add mass? I am six foot three, 165 pounds, 37 years old. I can eat whatever I want in whatever quantities I want, and my weight never changes. I would like to be heavier. I&#8217;ve tried weight programs and I tone up okay, but it&#8217;s rare to add more than five pounds. The minute I stop the program, I&#8217;m instantly back to 165. Everything else you always talk about like diet, sleep, and stress is already dialed in.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Man. There are some folks that advocate fasting as kind of a means to lean body mass gain. The literature on it doesn&#8217;t really paint it in a super favorable light. I &#8230; This was kind of my problem. I enjoyed power lifting, but my body just desperately likes being about 165 to 170 pounds. Even getting up to about 175, which if I get up to 175 from lifting and not just being fat, then I look pretty good. And if I start getting 180, 185, I look big, you know? I have kind of small bone structure, I guess-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> It&#8217;s like the big arms when you walked to the coffee shop when I first met you.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> It&#8217;s like the big arms when I swept you off your feet on our first meeting. Exactly. Shout out to Carla Mack around that. But the bastard of this thing is I would eat and eat. I mean, like six meals a day. Big meals. Felt disgusting. You know? And I would get busy, go on a trip, whatever it was, and I would lose 10 pounds just almost instantly. And so, it&#8217;s &#8230; I think there is some degree of a set point for people, and there&#8217;s just kind of a reality that you know, for some people, muscle mass gain is easier. Again, this is one of these things, Brett doesn&#8217;t &#8230; Does he mention? 37 years old?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I would get androgen levels checked and make sure that testosterone, estrogen, sex hormone binding, globulin. We&#8217;ve covered this in a previous podcast. And this is something that we&#8217;re going to dig into later in some more depth, like really understanding what your hormonal profile means and what to do about it if it&#8217;s not kind of at an optimized level.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> If that&#8217;s not optimized, then the anabolic stimulus from the food and the training is going to be poultry. So, you&#8217;re just kind of peeing in the wind with that. So, that would be the couple of things that I would think about. I would look at androgens and see what testosterone and that whole gamete of things looks like. I would &#8230; And then if that looks pretty good or depending on what you want to do, even then though, there&#8217;s just &#8230; Gaining muscular weight is tough for a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Right. So, it seems like fasting is not a good option for adding mass and like fasting&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Fasting is definitely not a good option. Yeah. I mean, at least just do three meals a day. If you want to do a little time restricted feeding, that&#8217;s great. There does seem to be some literature that suggests eating more calories earlier in the day. Bill Lagakos has talked about this at nauseum. That seems good, and it seems like kind of a no downside deal, because you could just eat huge breakfast, big lunch, small dinner. Try to stick them a little tighter together, and there seems to be some legit body composition improvements, metabolic improvements, and it should kind of stack the deck favorably for muscle mass gain, and you&#8217;re getting a little bit of that sirtuin type signaling that&#8217;s associating with fasting, ketosis, and all that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But yeah. As a baseline, getting back to the actual question asked, fasting is probably not a great idea in this case. I know there&#8217;s examples of people who do it, but it just sounds like Brett has a tough time gaining muscle mass, and so, I think depriving his body of anabolic signal from protein for extended periods is probably not a great idea for improving muscle muss and body composition.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. That&#8217;s our last question for this week.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Sweet. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Let&#8217;s see. If you &#8230; Or as always, submit questions at robbwolf.com on the contact page, and let&#8217;s see, we drip these questions out each week on Instagram, so make you&#8217;re following at dasrobbwolf. What else?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We still have some stuff over at YouTube. They haven&#8217;t taken that down yet either. So, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I think that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We&#8217;ll catch you guys next week.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Take care everybody.</p>

<p><b>1. <a href="https://youtu.be/TsZVbmPgoNk">Endurance Fueling For A Keto Athlete</a> </b>[2:00]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cassandra says:</p>
<p>Dear Robb + Nicki,</p>
<p>First off&#8230;thanks for the great job you two do in making complicated nutrition and fitness information easy to access and understand (even for uneducated gym rats like myself).&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been listening to the podcast for years, reading the blog and the books (just got Wired to Eat) and I still find myself learning something new almost weekly.</p>
<p>Bottom line up front &#8211; how do you guys recommend tackling post-workout nutrition for endurance / high-intensity sports while on the keto train?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 35, 5&#8217;8&#8221;, 155 lbs with a fairly muscular build.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been doing the Crossfit + weightlifting thing for 5-6 years now (4-6 times a week).&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got 10 strict pull ups, a 250 lb 1 RM back squat, a 285 1RM DL and can hold an L-sit for a minute&#8230;.so I think I&#8217;m pretty strong(?) &#8211; in some aspects anyway &#8230;&nbsp; Strict bedtimes at 8:30 every night with 8 hours of sleep, no injuries, no severe reactions to any type of food (except tequila) &#8211; BUT I perform and look a lot better when I&#8217;m strict about paleo.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been eating that way and it has been keeping me fueled really well in the aforementioned training situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the nature of my job &#8211; active duty Marine, I am required to run a 5k every year for time&#8230;so I do incorporate running into my weekly routine &#8211; usually no more than 15-20 miles a week&#8230;long-ish runs mixed with hill sprints or pushing sleds so I don&#8217;t die of cardio boredom.</p>
<p>Within the past year &#8211; &#8211; due to losing a bet or being shamed into them (I can&#8217;t quite remember), I&#8217;ve also been running a few half marathons and one marathon.&nbsp; I plan do to one more full later this year, the Rock n Roll in Las Vegas &#8211; mostly because its an excuse to travel to Vegas with some girlfriends of mine. The low-carb/paleo diet has been awesome for my health&nbsp; on the weightlifting/crossfit/sprinting side of things&#8230; but I&#8217;m struggling with the endurace side of my fitness.</p>
<p>For my runs more than 90 minutes, I&#8217;ve been fueling with some organic stinger chewies/gels near the end of my run and then other, whole-food-type carbs at the end&#8230;.bananas, berries, coconut water&#8230;sometimes gatorade, (an occasional beer :)), etc.&nbsp; My recovery has been OK&#8230;not awesome though (and when I take out the mid-run or end carbs, my energy tanks and my joints hurt for days)&#8230;.. it takes me about me 1-2 days to get through my soreness for half marathons and almost 5 days for a run more than 22 miles WITH the intra and post-carbs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently jumped on the keto train in January&#8230;did your masterclass, read Mark Sisson&#8217;s book, started listening to a lot of low-carb / keto based podcasts (Shawn Baker, Fat Burning Man, etc) and just started Wired to Eat.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been trying to do my own homework and listen to my body&#8230;so far this keto thing has been great! I&#8217;ve dropped about 10 lbs since the beginning of the year, have been sleeping a lot better and have seen gains in my strength.&nbsp; But the race season starts up in May (the LV Marathon is in November but I have smaller races and training runs scheduled throughout the summer) and I want to be prepared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I *think* I&#8217;m generally fat-adapted&#8230;but I panic after 8 or 9 miles sometimes (the old advice of &#8220;carb loading&#8221; always creeps back in) and will suck down a terrible gel or gatorade because I&#8217;ve made the mistake of running these distances underfueled before and it was a painful, painful lesson.&nbsp; I have heeded your electrolyte advice. I constantly track my sodium, magnesium and potassium levels and take the recommended supplements almost every day (normally on days with a taxing WOD or a workout lasting more than 90 mins).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what can I eat/drink to keep on the keto train that will help me recover and keep me going on some of these endurance events?&nbsp; Nut butters? Whey protein and water? I want to be armed when I take on Vegas this year and not completely derail my eating habits. And I&#8217;d like to start experimenting with these foods now, while I still have time to adjust.</p>
<p>Sorry for writing the novel!&nbsp; If I can find this info in a podcast or in one of the chapters of your books, please feel free to point me in that direction!&nbsp; I appreciate any insight you guys have. Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Cassandra</p>

<p><b> 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/Y9oo9kK0WbU">Should I Add Fat To My Whey Protein Shake? </a></b>[10:40]</p>
<p>Ben says:</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Love the podcast (I am one of the six listeners)! Here is my question:</p>
<p>I am wondering if the insulin-spike from a post-workout whey shake can stall my weight loss. Should I add fat like heavy cream or coconut milk to the shake to blunt the insulin response (if yes how much) or am I unable to burn that fat because of the spiked insulin storing it as body fat instead.</p>
<p>Thank you so much and best wishes from Munich, Germany</p>
<p>Ben</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/reblW4fQ_xI">Portal Circulation and Leaky Gut </a></b>[14:36]</p>
<p>James says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed answer to my question about sun exposure in Q&amp;A #7. You provided a clear and concise answer which is hard to come by these days!</p>
<p>Following your book recommendations in Q&amp;A #6 I hungrily delved into the <a href="http://watcut.uwaterloo.ca/webnotes/Metabolism/">Lecture notes on Human Metabolism</a> (Thanks Nikki!) and within the first chapter encountered some information that gave me reason to pause.</p>
<p>The portal circulation, I&#8217;m certain that you can provide a more accurate and concise explanation of this system to your listeners than I can in this question, so I&#8217;ll leave that to you if that&#8217;s okay!</p>
<p>My question is: given that all blood (and therefore solutes) from the intestines are drained through the portal vein and through the liver &#8211; filtering out excess substrates and removing toxins such as ammonia from the blood before it enters &#8216;general circulation&#8217;, how can leaky gut have such a damaging effect on the body? It seems to me that the liver is a vital backstop in this process which is never mentioned when functional medicine practitioners talk about leaky gut &#8211; they give the impression that blood drains from the intestines straight into cardiovascular circulation and these fuel substrates are clanking around in our arteries causing inflammation which seems not to be the case!</p>
<p>Also how does this impact the gut hypothesis of heart disease (highly simplified here) where endotoxin is said to pass through the mucosal membrane into circulation, binding with LDL cholesterol, being attacked and immobilized by immune cells and ultimately ending up being sequestered into an arterial plaque because the immune system cannot destroy cholesterol or unbind the endotoxin from it.</p>
<p>Would the portal circulation not remove this endotoxin from the blood before it enters cardiovascular circulation and meets LDL particles? Is this disease process driven not only by a compromised intestinal lining but also by inefficient liver function?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time again guys, really appreciate your input</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>James</p>

<p>Is there an estimate for calories/pound when it comes to feeding my almost 3 year old (or any child for that matter, say 2-12? The teen years of course marking the onset of self-consciousness and peer pressure, thus thwarting any biological hard-wiring toward survival.)</p>
<p>Or is she still young enough to be biologically incapable of starving herself, at which point I should just trust that she has normally functioning satiety signals?</p>
<p>I ask specifically about my daughter because, as is par for the course in &#8216;Murica, she received antibiotics immediately after being born, so it&#8217;s not a stretch for me to imagine that she could have some kind of gut imbalance that could cause hormone dysregulation with her leptin/ghrelin.</p>

<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Don&#8217;t. Stop. Stop. We&#8217;re rolling.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We are rolling. What&#8217;s up wife?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You know, just kind of riding the wave of chaos.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Indeed. Indeed. So, we&#8217;re in the throws of packing, getting ready to move.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We had a nice visit from your friend, Steve yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Good friend of mine, Steve who&#8230; A 20 year military veteran flying a B1 Bomber and I got to hang out with him and we related many stories that we-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I only met him once before, him and his wife once before, when Robb and I first met and let&#8217;s just say in the few hours that we spent together yesterday, I learned a lot about what you did as a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah and most of it was probably incarceration worthy.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> There were lots of laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We turned out okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You guys survived.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yep. We did. We did.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I&#8217;m drinking a Salty Palmer, which is a black tea, Lipton ice tea specifically, with a-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> LMNT Citrus Salt.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230; LMNT Citrus Salt in it and it&#8217;s pretty darn good.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Really good. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Do you want to jump in on this thing?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Sure. Let&#8217;s jump in. Our first question this week is from Cassandra and Cassandra wrote a very, very lengthy question and I&#8217;m just going to read-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Great detail, but it&#8217;s-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Really wonderful detail, but I&#8217;m just going to read some sections of it. But the main gist of her question is, how do you recommend tackling post workout nutrition for endurance and high intensity sports while on keto? So let&#8217;s see here.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay, so she says, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m generally fat adapted, but I panic after eight or nine miles sometimes because the old advice of carb bloating always creeps back in and I will suck down a terrible gel or Gatorade because I&#8217;ve made the mistake of running these distances under fuel before and it was a painful, painful lesson. I&#8217;ve heated your electrolyte advice and I constantly track my sodium, magnesium and potassium levels and take the recommended supplements almost every day. Normally on days with a taxing wad or a workout lasting more than 90 minutes. So what can I eat or drink to keep on the keto train that will help me recover and keep me going on some of these endurance events? Nut butters, whey protein and water. I want to be armed when I take on Vegas this year and not completely derail my eating habits and I&#8217;d like to start experimenting with these foods now while I still have time to adjust. Sorry for writing a novel.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So just to fill in some of the details, she has done several half marathons and a marathon and she&#8217;s wanting to do another full marathon later this year. The Rock and Roll in Las Vegas</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative) and lots of great detail, so if you guys check out the show notes-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We&#8217;ll post the full question, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230; you can kind of dig into that stuff. So what one thing up front, I&#8217;m definitely not an endurance coach. We&#8217;ve dabbled in that area when we ran the gym, it wasn&#8217;t really my area of interests nor expertise. So I&#8217;m going to give some general guidelines, but I&#8217;m not an endurance coach. That said, one thing that I would recommend is following all the work from Zach Bitter. He has set multiple, I think national and world champion distances, 100 mile races, largely keto fueled, keto carnivore fueled. He drops in some carbs though. He has kind of a strategy around what he does with that. Part of what she related is she feels soreness and difficulty recovering after her hard sessions, in particular when she&#8217;s using carbs, interestingly.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> This is one of the interesting things that folks that are in that keto, carnivore space seem to report they just seem to bounce back from workouts better. They don&#8217;t seem to get the delayed onset muscle soreness and all that stuff. It&#8217;s kind of funny, before we were recording this I was kind of noodling in the shower about how low carb in the context of a higher protein, like keto gain style, ketogenic diet or carnivore diet or even some of the old, original Loren Cordain protein recommendations. Even though it&#8217;s low carb technically, because you&#8217;re not eating carbohydrate as part of the diet, it&#8217;s not necessarily low glycogen.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The keto scene has gotten all freaked out about gluconeogenesis and being kicked out of ketosis, but this is all still super context driven stuff. For an individual that needs really, legit levels of ketones for say, like neurological condition or for cancer, co-treatment or something like that, then there&#8217;s a compelling reason to kind of limit protein.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But what&#8217;s interesting is that, and again I&#8217;m going to bounce around like there&#8217;s a zillion things I&#8217;m thinking about, but Charles Poliquin recommended for people who were not particularly carb sensitive, but doing high intensity training, a pretty high protein, low carb diet and then, supplemental glutamine post-workout because the glutamine was kind of a slow release way of topping off glycogen levels, both in the liver and the muscles. But that didn&#8217;t have some of the other side effects potentially of carbs and I know people are going to freak out. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, carbs aren&#8217;t the devil.&#8221; Yeah, they&#8217;re not, except when they are.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> For some people like me, who still have some sort of GI problems or what have you, type one diabetics or people that are just tinkering with this stuff, there are other ways of getting reasonably good glycogen repletion, while also still staying in more of that kind of fat adapted world.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So one thing about this, we have to break this stuff into kind of training nutrition, event nutrition, post recovery nutrition. So during the event, this is definitely where she made the point that she needs to experiment with this stuff and see what&#8217;s what&#8217;s working. Again, I would kind of pun to what Zach Bitter does, as just kind of a beginning baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I think that in general, if he&#8217;s doing something that&#8217;s more in that 100 mile pace, he stays pretty much fat and protein because he&#8217;s going to be going at such a gentle pace comparatively because he&#8217;s going to run for basically, like two days straight and so he just not going to get glycolytic. So, in that context then, there doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be additional carbs or not much additional carbs to the degree that there might be a lot of elevation change or something like that. Therefore, going anaerobic, getting some glycolysis going on, then we might drop in some type of carb.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Again, you just have to play around with that stuff to see what sits well with gastric emptying and all that type of stuff. I feel like I&#8217;m just kind of bouncing around here, but it&#8217;s interesting. So, she also mentions that in the past, she was kind of worried at some point and this is where I think doing some training runs that are on the longer side and to establish like, how do you do? So she said that she panics after eight or nine miles sometimes. So there should probably be some like 12 or 15 mile runs consistently within the training block where you pressure test. It&#8217;s like, how do you feel at mile 10 through 15 with a particular type of training without necessarily doing a goo or something like that?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Even that said, there are a lot of people in the low carb space that, over the course of a day of activity like this, they may consume two or 300 grams of carbs on that day, which is still quite a bit less than what most other people are doing. But this is where there&#8217;s just a massive amount of individual variation. Again, I&#8217;m just not the most knowledgeable person on that side of things.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, the takeaways, we don&#8217;t necessarily need to just cater towards ketosis. Don&#8217;t think about it being ketosis. Think about it being performance fueling. It may be on the lower carb side, it may be on the higher carb side. Even if it&#8217;s on the lower carb side, if our protein intake is higher, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean low glycogen for the body. So that can have all kinds of ramifications for recovery and nutrient intake.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> She definitely needs to make sure she&#8217;s not skimping on the protein.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. The one caveat with that and this is where it gets really detailed, in event training, you may be, particularly if water may be a little bit limited or what have you, higher protein intake requires more water to deal with the ammonia load that&#8217;s coming out of that. But you don&#8217;t necessarily want to go super low protein because you will burn through all your branched-chain amino acids and then, tryptophan levels raise. The person will be running along and they get sleepy and they&#8217;ll literally, fall asleep and it happens a lot on a bicycle, mid run or at a minimum you lose some of that kind of motivation because you&#8217;re getting sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So this is some of the stuff again, that folks just have to play with. Like what protein level keeps you mentally alert? Because you don&#8217;t have enough branched-chain amino acids in the mix. Some people use of branched-chain amino acids as part of their training mix and stuff like that. But this is again where, it&#8217;s just super outside of my-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Wheelhouse.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230; Yeah, my wheelhouse. But those are some kind of big, broad brush strokes to consider when you&#8217;re doing this stuff. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see here. Next question is from Ben. Should I add fat to my whey protein shake? Ben says, &#8220;Hi, I love the podcast. I&#8217;m one of the six listeners. Here is my question. I&#8217;m wondering if the insulin spike from a post workout whey shake can stall my weight loss? Should I add fat, like heavy cream or coconut milk to the shake to blunt the insulin response? And if yes, how much or am I unable to burn that fat because of the spike insulin storing it as body fat instead? Thank you so much and best wishes from Munich, Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Man. So, whenever I see someone who&#8217;s&#8230; So clearly, I would read between the lines here, that the goal is fat loss, right? If you&#8217;re in a fat loss mode, you don&#8217;t need a shake. You just don&#8217;t. You need to chew food. Three meals a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, possibly a snack. I rarely have a snack. I eat two, sometimes three meals a day. It just kind of depends, but you don&#8217;t need a snack and you really don&#8217;t need the shake as a baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That&#8217;s not really answering the question, but we noticed this within our gym based practice and I kind of felt like&#8230; And I would have all kinds of people, like Spencer Nadolsky, who are like, &#8220;Oh, shakes aren&#8217;t the devil and everything.&#8221; But I just saw people spin out and they would go from eating pretty well and then, do liquid food. Then they were hungry and then, they would end up overeating pretty consistently.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Then I started hanging out with Tyler and Luis and really watched the way that they handled things within the keto gains group and man, they could&#8217;ve made a mint linking wagons with some protein company and recommending that. Just their ethics are so sound that, what they noticed was that people who are really legitimately struggling with weight loss don&#8217;t do well with liquid food, don&#8217;t do well with shakes. They need to eat unprocessed food for the most part.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So Ben, I would one&#8230; It kind of becomes a nonissue. If we get people eating whole and processed food, it&#8217;s not really going to be a problem. That said, in the context of eating beef or whey protein and the subsequent insulin response from that, it doesn&#8217;t matter in the grand scheme of things, whether or not that&#8217;s going to influence fat loss overall. That&#8217;s still going to be driven by total caloric load, ultimately.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Some of the things mixed into that, if we get&#8230; Like in some people, and this is where some people will tolerate more or fewer carbs. If we get a disproportionate insulin response to carbohydrates and we get a low blood sugar environment, then people are going to tend to want to eat more food. We tend to not see this when the insulin response is from protein.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And this is another piece that&#8217;s kind of interesting when people talk about bodybuilding or recovery. Proteins do release insulin and so, you&#8217;re not necessarily always in a completely low insulin environment, even though you&#8217;re eating low carb. This gets born out, when you see the flip side of the crazy keto scene, where people are limiting protein intake because they&#8217;re freaked out about the insulin response to this whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So I know that&#8217;s kind of all over the place. But Ben, I would definitely ditch the shake and once you get to a level of leanness that is fantastic and you&#8217;re training like absolute crazy, such that three meals a day don&#8217;t work then&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Then have the shake.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230; dump a shake in. I wish that shakes did as well as real food but they just don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s another one of these things where we&#8217;ve really never recommended shakes. Here and there-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Specific situations.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yes. Specific situations. Yeah, so I think I beat that one to death.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is from James on portal circulation and leaky gut. &#8220;Hi Robb. Thanks for your detailed answer to my question about sun exposure in QA number seven. Following your book recommendations in QA number six, I hungrily delved into the lecture notes on human metabolism. Thanks Nicki. And within the first chapter, I encountered some information that gave me reason to pause. The portal circulation, I&#8217;m certain that you can provide a more accurate and concise explanation of the system to your listeners than I can in this question, so I&#8217;ll leave that to you if that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> My question is, given that all blood and therefore, solutes from the intestines are drained through the portal vein and through the liver, filtering out excess substrates and removing toxins, such as ammonia from the blood before it enters general circulation, how can leaky gut have such a damaging effect on the body? It seems to me that the liver is a vital backstop in this process, which was never mentioned, when functional medicine practitioners talk about leaky gut. They give the impression that blood drains from the intestines straight into the cardiovascular circulation and these fuel substrates are clinking around in our arteries causing inflammation, which seems not to be the case.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Also, how does this impact the gut hypothesis of heart disease? Highly simplified here, where endotoxins is said to pass through the mucosal membrane into circulation, binding with LDL cholesterol, being attacked and immobilized by immune cells and ultimately, ending up being sequestered into an arterial plaque because the immune system cannot destroy cholesterol or unbind the endotoxin from it. With the portal circulation not removed, this endotoxin from the blood before it enters cardiovascular circulation and meets LDL particles. Is this disease process driven not only by a compromised intestinal lining but also by inefficient liver function? Thank you for your time. Really appreciate your input.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question and this is kind of, definitely before, oh, one question. This is kind of-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Super advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230; Chris Masterjohn area. Usually, he&#8217;s the one that delves into stuff like this, but it&#8217;s a fantastic question. So for people that aren&#8217;t familiar with this, the portal circulation is the kind of circulatory loop that drains the gut and goes, as what James said, largely to liver and we do get it&#8230; This is where chylomicrons, the packages of lipids are unstitched and reshuffled and put into triglycerides and into lipoproteins. Proteins are kind of sorted and shuffle. Carbohydrates are stored at least, in part, in the liver. Then also throughout the rest of the body and that&#8217;s actually, a great example of this LPS story that James is alluding to.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> What he&#8217;s asking here is a great question. In this leaky gut story, there&#8217;s this discussion around lipopolysaccharide, which is kind of the cellular identification matrix around bacteria and this stuff is incredibly inflammatory in all vertebrates. It sends the vertebrate immune system into kind of an overdrive response. But James, if we just subbed out LPS for carbohydrate, this pretty much answers the story.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So although dietary carbohydrate fills some, potentially all of the liver glycogen, there&#8217;s virtually always more that goes to the rest of the body. So although it removes some, it does not remove all. In the case of this LPS story in general, the liver should be effective. The liver in conjunction with the lipoproteins, the lipoproteins like LDL lipoproteins, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, these things bond to LPS and it tends to help in the detoxification of this substance. But if we have more LPS than what we&#8217;re really able to deal with-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> The liver handles some and the rest-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The liver handles some and then, we get the the spillover and that&#8217;s one piece of the story. Another piece of the story is that a lot of the lipid containing substances don&#8217;t go directly into the portal system. It goes into the lymphatic system and the lymphatic system then dumps in right around the aorta.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So it does make it into general circulation without going through the liver first. So that one year of medical school anatomy actually pays off every once in a while. So, this is a great question though. There are kind of two directions that the LPS story gets around the liver.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The first one is that there may just be more occurring than what the liver can reasonably detoxifying. Then the other part is the lipid constituents that end up in the lymphatic system, also end up dumped into general circulation, do ultimately make it into the liver, but that&#8217;s another spot where this stuff ends up.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, but a really good question. <a href="http://watcut.uwaterloo.ca/webnotes/Metabolism/">Lecture Notes on Human Metabolism</a> is just an outstanding book. Really, really good. It was oriented for individuals heading towards medical school. So it was kind of, an end of their senior year. Like how to pull all the biochemistry, cellular biology, vertebrate physiology all together and make some sense of it. The MD-PhD who put that book together, he oriented a bunch of pharmaceuticals into it. He talked about statins, he talked about blood pressure mentally. It&#8217;s really an outstanding book, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is on phytic acid from Joseph. &#8220;Is phytic acid harmful or of benefit? Is it really necessary to jump through the hoops of soaking and sprouting before consuming nuts and seeds?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> What do you think on this wife? What&#8217;s your gut sense?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> A lot of people do find benefit when they soak and sprout.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> For sure and I would throw this under the, it depends category. So phytates and even&#8230; Gosh, there&#8217;s this stuff out of rice, I want to say. Ip-6, which is kind of one of these bonding chemicals, kind of a culation type chemicals. They can be beneficial in some circumstances and they can be a bastard in other circumstances. Georgia Ede who is a psychiatrist and really incredibly knowledgeable on this stuff, has some great studies where individuals would eat something like oysters, which are very high in zinc, and you would quantify the amount of zinc in the oysters. Then the person would consume it and they would actually do some plasma zinc analysis. So they can show, &#8220;Okay, the before oyster, plasma zinc was here and post-oyster plasma&#8230;&#8221; So it&#8217;s showing that you&#8217;re absorbing it or it&#8217;s magically appearing in your bloodstream, one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Then she showed eating the same oyster meal, but with either say, fruit or corn tortillas. The fruit does not have phytates in it. The corn tortillas have quite a lot and the corn tortillas, plus the zinc source, basically made the zinc absorption zero. I mean, it just gutted it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So this is one of these things that&#8217;s really interesting and in looking at a lot of the Weston A. Price stuff, traditional cultures bent over backwards to soak and sprout and ferment and process grains, legumes and even dairy, for the most part. So, I think that there was some really good wisdom to all that. It kind of dovetails around on another piece around this kind of emerging story around the carnivore concept and whatnot and I could make a case that&#8230; How do I want to say this?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The amount of plant material that we eat is allowable only up to the point that it displaces animal products. At some point the overconsumption of plant material could potentially cause nutrient depletion. I know this is going to be a super controversial topic, but when you look at, let&#8217;s say just things like spinach, they may contain different nutrients that may be valuable and they may look like they&#8217;re in a large amount, particularly from a nutrient density standpoint, like a percentage of folate per calorie. But the thing is, the plant based materials are not that absorbable and oftentimes have constituents in them, like phytates that are antagonistic towards their absorption.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> These things can also interfere with&#8230; They&#8217;re basically protease inhibitors, so they inhibit the ability to break down protein, both plant and animal protein. So again, how important is it? I think it boils down a little bit to individual situations. But I think to the degree that people can get away with not doing this, is reflective of all the other right stuff they&#8217;re doing. Also, I think that you&#8217;re just kind of beating your system a little bit. Like there&#8217;s some pressure testing that&#8217;s occurring there.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, if you&#8217;re going to do bread, I would do something like Ezekiel bread that&#8217;s been soaked and sprouted and all that type of stuff. A lot of people are finding these ancient grains, like the Einhorn wheat and then soaking, sprouting, doing the sourdough mix that that helps to break down the gluten and all that stuff. Although there&#8217;s some great literature indicating that not a lot of celiacs still react to the Einhorn wheat, even after it&#8217;s gone through all of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I&#8217;ll be completely honest, even though the Weston A. Price stuff is pretty cool, I think that this is still why a lot of people are pretty fucked up in that scene. Because they&#8217;re just logistically dogmatic about having these foods and they don&#8217;t realize that even some pastured dairy may be problematic for some people. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, it&#8217;s super context driven, and this is again, where if somebody has general problems or they&#8217;re just wanting to ask a question, if they may be grain, dairy or legume reactive, pull them out for 30 days, reintroduce and see how you do. But I would say that to the degree, that you process these things with these traditional methods. It&#8217;s definitely going to improve the nutrient value of those foods and it&#8217;s going to decrease the likelihood of damaging the nutrient value of other foods.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our final question this week is from Rory. He wants to know about a caloric estimate for young children. Rory says, &#8220;Is there an estimate for calories per pound when it comes to feeding my almost three year old or any child for that matter, say from two to 12? The teen years of course, make marking the onset of self-consciousness and peer pressure, thus thwarting any biological hard-wiring towards survival or is she still young enough to be biologically incapable of starving herself? At which point, I should just trust that she has a normally functioning, satiety signals? I ask specifically, about my daughter because as is par for the course in America, she received antibiotics immediately after being born. So it&#8217;s not a stretch for me to imagine that she could have some kind of gut imbalance that could cause hormone dysregulation with her leptin and ghrelin.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Good question, but my gut sense is, Rory&#8217;s probably being a little too worried about this. Also, I don&#8217;t know how early&#8230; How old did she say?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Three.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> She said she&#8217;s three.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Almost three.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay. I mean, I know there are some benchmarks out there. I think it&#8217;s something like 16 or 18 calories per pound or maybe it&#8217;s 20 calories per pound. I forget off the top of my head, but it&#8217;s a lot of calories generally. But even if you know this, then it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re going to weigh and measure their food and then, you need to weigh and measure what they didn&#8217;t eat and you need to separate out the protein, carbs, fat.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> That&#8217;s a lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> It&#8217;s a lot of fucking work. The risk-reward deal, I just don&#8217;t see. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I think you feed them and they eat until they&#8217;re-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Full.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8230; full. Especially if you&#8217;re feeding him unprocessed, real foods, they&#8217;re not going to overeat.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right and they will generally not under eat and also, kids tend to cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> They do cycle, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Zoe and Sagan, it&#8217;s funny. We don&#8217;t have a pool, but our friend has a pool and we&#8217;ve been taking them swimming. On the days when they swim, they don&#8217;t really eat that much and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Man, they should be really hungry.&#8221; But then I tell you what, the next day, they eat everything that&#8217;s not nailed down. They just don&#8217;t want to get out of the water. So they might have an Epic bar or something like that and just kind of a little snack here and there. But they&#8217;re so excited to swim that they won&#8217;t get out and they might do a half decent dinner. But then oftentimes, they are so smoked by the end of the day of swimming. I mean, like six hours of swimming. There in the sun and all the rest of that. They don&#8217;t even really eat that much. They&#8217;re almost passing out at the table.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But then, the next day they get up and they eat everything. Which I think is a really&#8230; that&#8217;s a great&#8230; In general, kids tend to do a really good job with that. I think that this is something that, over the course of time because of my kind of power lifting background, for ages, I just kind of over ate because I felt like I needed to eat more. I finally, at almost 50, have gotten to a spot where it&#8217;s like, if I just kind of sit on my duff all day, I don&#8217;t need that much food. Then on the day where I&#8217;m real active, I may lift weights and do two hours of Jujitsu, I eat a lot of food that day and then, maybe even the following day I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Man, I&#8217;m pretty hungry.&#8221; So I end up eating more.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> If we&#8217;re not eating odd foods, I think that the appetite control mechanisms are very well in place and I wouldn&#8217;t worry about a round of antibiotics displacing that stuff. It&#8217;s a great question to ask, but I wouldn&#8217;t be overly concerned about that. Anything else as a mom to cap that off?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I don&#8217;t think so. I think it is cyclic. I mean, I think that&#8217;s fairly normal, where one day they might eat a ton and the next day it tapers off a bit. She&#8217;s not going to starve herself.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Nope. Nope. The thing that we do, we kind of make it a speed bump method. We really kind of hold the kid&#8217;s feet to the fire. It&#8217;s like, you got eat your protein and then, if you want some more of this other stuff, then we kind of open it up and that works. That works fine.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We have noticed, even within the two kids, if Sagan in particular, who seems to kind of take after me a little bit more, at least in some ways, if she doesn&#8217;t get enough protein, that kid gets cranky, real cranky. It&#8217;s just like a switch just flips and then, she&#8217;ll eat and she&#8217;s good. I think she ends up potentially, getting a little bit of these kind of blood sugar changes, if she&#8217;s not getting enough protein. So, you&#8217;ll notice a little bit of variability on that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Whereas, I think Zoe is a little bit more like you and just a little more even keel, with regards to&#8230; She&#8217;ll eat a lot of protein, but even if she doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t seem to affect her quite the same way. But Sagan&#8217;s also going through growth spurt, so I don&#8217;t know how much of that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> She&#8217;s sleeping like 15 hours at night.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. Yeah and she&#8217;s just been sprouting. So that&#8217;s a whole other crazy thing to this and it&#8217;s been funny all the way along. Now that the girls are basically seven and five, the changes aren&#8217;t quite as dramatic. Maybe up to about three years old, maybe four years old, it feels like every time you kind of get dialed in on one sequence, then they change and you&#8217;ve got to rejigger things. But they still change over time and for sure right now, Sagan is growing a lot, sleeping a lot and we noticed that if she doesn&#8217;t eat well, she will get some cranky McCrankerkins going on. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. I think that&#8217;s a wrap for this week.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yep. Yep. Thank you guys for the awesome questions. Enjoyed doing this, as always. Most of my activity, at least for a while, is still over at Instagram @dasrobbwolf. This episode brought to you by&#8230;</p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p><b> 1. </b><a href="https://youtu.be/vKJfQp202-4"><b>Overeating On Keto</b></a> [2:08]</p>
<p>Steve says:</p>
<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to take too much of your time. But going Keto for me has found me doing exactly what I feared I could do. I have been Paleo for five or six years and so has my wife. We have no kids at home so grains and junky carbs are not and issue or even a temptation. I am in the middle of doing the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">keto masterclass</a>, which I am savouring because I have been making some mistakes.</p>
<p>I am 50 years old and work out regularly doing either mixed kettlebell workouts or if I do weight and resistance training at the moment I like to do whole body workouts 3 X a week and can mix in some cardio in between. I have kept fit most of my life, my goal is as I age to stay lean and keep mobile. Pretty simple goal.</p>
<p>We live in Perth in Western Australia so we have great weather and lots of sun. I work as a gardener in a private school, a job I love doing as I&#8217;m outside and moving all day, not as hard as say some sort of construction worker but that can happen on a given day just not every day.</p>
<p>Coming from eating paleo the transition for me has been pretty easy. As I went low carb and increased the fat I was eating my wife liked the sound of it so she hopped on board. She is doing great and in fact better than me. We aren&#8217;t really that worried about measuring ketones at this stage, it has been more about getting the diet right.</p>
<p>My issue is, I love the food. For some reason it has made me hungrier. Stocking our fridge and cupboards I made sure that we had all we needed and I wanted to see what I liked to eat also.</p>
<p>So I have blown it on all sorts of things. I have had days where I ate too much thickened cream, one tub has 800 calories and it is so easy to eat. I have blown it on nut butter and blown it on cheese. I can&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>At first it was wrapping my head around the fat content. I think I get it now. But I have put on body fat, which is so annoying. It&#8217;s not a train wreck but I feel like I am in a rut now and it&#8217;s hard to get out. I don&#8217;t want to quit because I can see and have felt the benefits. It&#8217;s just with the fat content and my physiology there seems to be no room for error.</p>
<p>I listen to your podcast and since listening I have gone to the ketogains website and worked out my macros. I was still tracking somewhat but some days I may have blown it by 5 or 6 hundred calories.</p>
<p>I have come so close to quitting as for me it seems to have been an easy way to get fat rather the leaner.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that you can help and not sure what else that I could tell you. Diet wise I have intermittent fasted for 3 or more years with differing protocols. Doing 16 &#8211; 20 hours is pretty comfortable. I workout in the mornings and often don&#8217;t eat until lunch time or when I get home from work.</p>
<p>My diet hasn&#8217;t changed too much except I have eaten cream, which I am now over. Adding more fat to my meals. Cooking in butter eating nuts and doing other keto style things. Apart from that my diet is still pretty primal. I love veggies. I have for years done a version of Mark Sisson&#8217;s big ass salad. Which would be my daily staple. Evening veggies could be broccoli with brussel sprouts maybe some Kale and mushrooms. Also we do milk Kefir but I try to keep that to a minimum.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions that would be great. Are there others that have had this sort of issue, going keto has made them fatter?</p>
<p>Really enjoy your podcast and thanks for all of the really useful info that you have put out. I have also read your books.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<p><b> 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/Mqwg8bxiNyg">What&#8217;s Up With Fiber &amp; Kids? </a></b>[8:58]</p>
<p>Rory says:</p>
<p>As part of restoring my own gut health, I&#8217;ve used prebiotic fibers in various doses based somewhat on Grace Liu&#8217;s advice, and I&#8217;m curious if and when supplemental fiber would be beneficial for my daughter?</p>
<p>Again assuming that she started off at a disadvantage because of the antibiotics, it seems to follow logically that prebiotic fiber would help her gut bacteria develop, and increase her overall health and resilience.</p>
<p>Is that actually logical?</p>
<p>And are there any cautions? Is there a certain dose that&#8217;s age-appropriate, or do I just slowly increase until she has digestive upset?</p>
<p>Should I mix fibers in order to feed a variety of bacteria, or are there certain fibers that are optimal for a young gut (i.e. what would a cavebaby be most likely to eat chew on for fun?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/S-bNv6aSZY8">Tips For Increasing Testosterone </a></b>[13:07]</p>
<p>Mads says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb,</p>
<p>In a previous Q&amp;A, you talked about how muscle gain/hypertrophy is caused by calorie surplus and progressive overload. You also mentioned that gaining muscle is, without a doubt, easier if you have High testosterone. Calorie surplus and PO is easy, but how do I increase my testosterone? You mentioned that there are a number of different tactics that you can use?</p>
<p>My testosterone is not low, but definitely not high either. I&#8217;m 27 and my testosterone is 640 ng/dL and my free testosterone is 16.36</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/urPyFr4DVWo">SHBG Elevated On Keto/Carnivore </a></b>[19:47]</p>
<p>Eoin says:</p>
<p>Since switching to keto I&#8217;ve noticed an increase in SHBG levels which brings down my free test. Total test has stayed high normal but was wondering how functional it is with the free portion bound up. DHEA is a bit low too. I feel great all in all but was just wondering what your thoughts are on that</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/ylW4zdKiSrI">Are Chicharrones (pork rinds) a Healthy Snack? </a></b>[22:47]</p>
<p>Isaac says:</p>
<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>Chicarones (pork rinds): are they a healthy snack?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard you indirectly mention them on the podcast some time ago, but I wasn&#8217;t able to infer whether your opinion is favorable or cautionary.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an ultra-runner, and during peak training season will spend about 20 hours per week running.&nbsp; In the bad old days I would top off my calories with a gigantic bowl of cold cereal in the evening, or an enormous serving of lentils and rice.&nbsp; But then I got woke, started monitoring my blood sugar, and started looking for low-carb options to fuel. I&#8217;m already having two salads each day, huge amounts of veggies, and as much meat as I can stomach.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m just looking for some calories to fuel the movement.</p>
<p>So are pork rinds okay?&nbsp; I avoid the flavored variety &#8211; the bags I buy just say &#8220;fried pork skin&#8221; on the ingredients list, and I dip them in sour cream. The best part is how easy it is to get an extra 1000 calories. And the flavor.</p>
<p>Am I headed towards clogged arteries? Are pork rinds actually healthy in the way that bacon is healthy&#8230;?</p>
<p>Thanks!! Love the show.</p>
<p>-Isaac</p>
<p>After submitting my question about whether pork rinds are an acceptable snack, I realized that Robb&#8217;s answer might be &#8216;we&#8217;d need to see your lab work&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p>So, in case it is relevant (and in case my question is selected for the show), here are some details.&nbsp; (I&#8217;d be glad to share the rest of the lab results, if they&#8217;re relevant.) Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Welcome back, wife.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> What&#8217;s new?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I always love asking that, because we just spin in the same four walls all day long.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So, you know everything that&#8217;s new?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We have nothing new. Well, we&#8217;re in the process of packing, getting ready to move.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative). Kids are out of school.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Kids are out of school. So we&#8217;re swimming, and the kids are walking the dogs around on leashes, and basically torturing the animals. Nicki&#8217;s been watching the wild kingdom that is our backyard, and our cat slaughtering all of the baby birds in the backyard.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki</strong>: We have this wonderful nest, a robin nest up in the tree, and I&#8217;ve been watching the parents come and feed the babies, and then yesterday morning there were no parents.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Silence.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> It was silent, and I think our cat slayed the whole family.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The cat&#8217;s been eyeballing this thing for probably a week, and I think he just waited for the baby birds to get fat enough to make it worth his while to climb the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Those ones I was particularly attached to, because I was watching them every day in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Oh, so the cat was pretty attached to them also.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right, let&#8217;s jump in on our questions. Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our first question this week is from Steve. He says, &#8220;He keeps stuffing up and it&#8217;s driving me crazy. Hi, Rob. I don&#8217;t want to take too much of your time, but going keto for me has found me doing exactly what I feared I could do. I have been paleo for five or six years and so was my wife. We have no kids at home, so grains and junky carbs are not an issue or even a temptation. I&#8217;m in the middle of doing the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">keto masterclass</a>, which I&#8217;m savoring, because I&#8217;ve been making some mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> 50 years old, workout regulAarly, doing, either mixed kettlebell workouts, or I do weight and resistance training. I like to do whole body workouts three times a week, and can mix in some cardio in between. I&#8217;ve kept fit most of my life and my goal is, as I age, to stay lean and keep mobile. Pretty simple.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We live in Perth, in Western Australia, so we have great weather and lots of sun. I work as a gardener at a private school, a job I love doing, as I&#8217;m outside and moving all day. Not as hard as some sort of construction worker, but that can happen on any given day, just not everyday. Coming from eating paleo, the transition for me has been pretty easy. As I went low carb and increased the fat I was eating, my wife like the sound of it, so she hopped on board. She&#8217;s doing great, in fact, better than me.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We aren&#8217;t really that worried about measuring ketones at this stage, it has been more about getting the diet right. But my issue is I love the food. For some reason, it has made me hungrier. Stocking our fridge and cupboards, I made sure that we had all we needed and I wanted to see what I liked to eat also. So I&#8217;ve blown it on all sorts of things. I&#8217;ve had days where I ate too much thickened cream, one tub has 800 calories, and it is so easy to eat. I&#8217;ve blown it on nut butter and blown it on cheese. I can&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> At first, it was wrapping my head around the fat content, but I think I get it now. But I have put on body fat, which is so annoying. It&#8217;s not a train wreck, but I feel like I&#8217;m in a rut, and it&#8217;s hard to get out. I don&#8217;t want to quit, because I can see, I have felt the benefits. It&#8217;s just with the fat content and my physiology, there seems to be no room for error.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I listened to your podcast, and since listening I&#8217;ve gone to the Ketogains website and worked out my macros. I was still tracking somewhat, but some days I may have blown it by 500 or 600 calories. I&#8217;ve come so close to quitting. As for me, it seems to have been an easy way to get fat rather than leaner. I&#8217;m not sure that you can help me, and I&#8217;m not sure what else I could tell you. Diet wise, I have intermittent fasted for three more years with different protocols. Doing 16 to 20 hours is pretty comfortable. I work out in the mornings, and I often don&#8217;t eat until lunch or when I get home from work.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> My diet hasn&#8217;t changed too much, except I&#8217;ve eaten cream, which I&#8217;m now over. Adding more fat to my meals, cooking in butter, eating nuts and doing other keto style things. Apart from that, my diet is still pretty normal. I love veggies. I have for years done a version of Mark Sisson&#8217;s, Big Ass Salad, which would be my daily staple. Evening veggies could be broccoli with brussels sprouts, maybe some kale and mushrooms. Also we do milk, kefir, but I try to keep that to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> If you have any suggestions, that would be great. Are there others that have had this sort of issue where going keto has made them fatter? Really enjoy your podcasts, and thanks for all of the really useful info that you&#8217;ve put out. I&#8217;ve also read your books. Best regards, Steve.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> You know, it&#8217;s funny when we were going through this, when I saw stuffing it up, I thought it was going to be a sinus issue. Do you have any thoughts on this? Like shooting [inaudible 00:04:30]</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> The thing is he didn&#8217;t mention protein at all, and he seems pretty focused on the fat, which as you talk about in the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">keto masterclass</a>, fat is a lever. Protein is first, because it&#8217;s the most satiating macronutrient. You know, he says he&#8217;s hungry, so I&#8217;m wondering if he&#8217;s not getting enough protein.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right, right. That&#8217;s kind of my first thought as well. The protein leverage hypothesis. It&#8217;s so hard to unpack this stuff, because a lot of people, if they come from a kind of a traditional western diet, they shift to low carb or even paleo, but let&#8217;s just say low carb. Instead of being on these carb roller coasters all the time, you just get this nice, even energy, even blood glucose levels. Whether it&#8217;s ketone fueled or not, it&#8217;s just like you&#8217;re not on the ups and downs. Generally, they notice that they&#8217;re not as hungry. But I think that that can kind of give way over time to being low protein.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Again, with that whole protein leverage hypothesis idea, whether you eat low carb or low fat, if you eat adequate protein, you&#8217;re probably going to be pretty good, you know, all other things being equal. But if you&#8217;re skinny on the protein, then your body is going to stimulate hunger and you&#8217;re going to tend to eat more food. There is kind of a reality that one of the dangers of kind of keto eating is that the bulk of the food is pretty calorically dense, you know? I mean, you could go pretty crazy on plain sweet potatoes or something like that. You know, I mean, just the calorie density is not any-&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> An extra wedge of cheese, depending on how you measure a wedge.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right, yeah, wedge. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Is a significant number of calories.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> A significant chunk of calories. So the protein would definitely be a thought. An additional thought, he seems to be kicking the bulk of his calories to later in the day. So I would, following a lot of Bill Lagakos&#8217; work, and things that we&#8217;re learning around time restricted eating, I would try shifting more of the calories earlier in the day. All things being equal, it seems like people generally do better with that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Then one final piece, is thinking about your electrolyte intake, in particular, sodium. So Tyler and Luis shot me an interesting paper the other day. So, there&#8217;s a lot of folklore in the keto world, which I kind of alluded to, that we get this kind of appetite suppressing effect while in ketosis and while fasting and stuff like that, and there&#8217;s definitely truth to that. But, when ketone salt had been studied, kind of head to head with ketone esters, it&#8217;s interesting, the esters produce higher levels of blood ketones, but they do not have an appetite blunting effect, not the way that ketone salts do.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Now, this is totally speculative, but one of the key features of ketone salts is they have a shit load of salt in them. We&#8217;ve often kind of joked that, you know, when people are like, &#8220;Man, I feel great using ketone salts.&#8221; It&#8217;s because they&#8217;re actually getting a decent wack of sodium, in particular, in addition to the other electrolytes. So, I would really be fastidious on protein, and then also make sure that you get at least that five grams per day of sodium specifically-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Especially because you&#8217;re in a warm climate, you&#8217;re outside all the time, you&#8217;re &#8230; yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. So those are some biggies in that. So I guess the three are be on point with protein, make sure that you&#8217;re getting your electrolytes addressed, and then finally, try shifting more of the calories earlier in the day, versus this later in the day eating schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. So Steve, do all that, and then report back.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Ping back and let us know. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. So our next question is from Rory. &#8220;What&#8217;s up with fiber and kids?&#8221; Rory says, &#8220;As part of restoring my own gut health, I&#8217;ve used prebiotic fibers in various doses based somewhat on Grace Liu&#8217;s advice, and I&#8217;m curious if and when a supplemental fiber would be beneficial for my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Again, assuming that she started off at a disadvantage because of the antibiotics, it seems to follow logically that prebiotic fiber would help her get bacteria develop and increase her overall health and resilience. Is that actually logical? Are there any cautions? Is there a certain dose that&#8217;s age appropriate? Or do I just slowly increase until she has digestive upset? Should I mix fibers in order to feed a variety of bacteria? Or are there certain fibers that are optimal for a young gut? I.e. what would a cave baby be most likely to eat or chew on for fun?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Man, that&#8217;s a lot going on there. So, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned the Sonnenberg Lab a couple of times. I got to speak with Erica Sonnenberg at the event that Akil Palanisamy puts on each year with UCSF. They&#8217;ve done so many different things, but just consuming fermented food, this was one of the studies. Folks were consuming fermented food and they looked at their gut microbiome profile, the diversity, and the, you know, various ratios before and then during, and after the intervention of adding fermented foods like kimchi and sauerkraut, and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> What was interesting is that the gut diversity increased while consuming the fermented food, but it wasn&#8217;t any of the bacteria that were part of the fermented food. It&#8217;s been understood for a long time, or at least somewhat understood, that that bacteria doesn&#8217;t necessarily play a role in populating the gut, at least not longterm, but it seems to tune the immune response, and perhaps creates an environment that&#8217;s more amenable for other organisms to occupy the space.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So that&#8217;s an interesting thing. It seems a little bit more holistic, and kind of leaves all the information processing up to the gut and the ecology of the gut, instead of trying to, you know, have this notion that we&#8217;re going to pinpoint, you know, fix anything that&#8217;s going on there. We&#8217;ve talked about this in previous episodes, supplementation with prebiotic fibers, it seems to be a little bit of a mixed bag. Some people do great with it, some people do terribly. The point about having a really diverse mixture I think makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Garden of Life, like Dr. Perlmutter&#8217;s prebiotic fiber, is a really nice spectrum. It has acacia in it, and lemon and orange peel pulp. It just has 20 different things in it. So, something like that could potentially be something that you add to maybe some apple sauce or something like that. I would probably keep the doses a little on the smaller side. I don&#8217;t know that I would really want to run a GI, you know, pressure test on that. But those are the things that I would noodle on with all that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> If you&#8217;re doing white potatoes, cassava, white rice, going through the whole process of cooking it, chilling it, you know, improving the resistant starch profile, I think that stuff makes sense. But I would be a little bit careful doing outright supplementation beyond that. Do you have any additional thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I got nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay. Yeah. But our kids love both kimchi and sauerkraut. They eat it. If we put it out, they will eat it. We just sometimes, in putting out the meal, forget to, but most kids will gravitate towards that pretty well. So I think that that&#8217;s kind of a nice, simple baseline that you can have that-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Just get the mild one.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, just get the mild one. Yeah, yeah. Every once in a while I mess up and get the red lid. Even though Sagan has a pretty spicy palateYup.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Alrighty. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is from Mads. Tips for increasing testosterone. &#8220;Hey, Rob. In a previous Q&amp;A you talked about how muscle gain in hypertrophy is caused by calorie surplus and progressive overload. You also mentioned that gaining muscle is, without a doubt, easier if you have high testosterone. Calorie surplus and progressive overload is easy, but how do I increase my testosterone? You mentioned that there are a number of different tactics that you can use. My testosterone is not low, but it&#8217;s definitely not high either. I&#8217;m 27, and my testosterone is 640 nanograms per deciliter, and my free testosterone is 16.36.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Man, this is a good question. So a young guy, it&#8217;s-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> His testosterone is lower than my dad&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, who&#8217;s 70.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> 70.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Which he&#8217;s just kind of a stud, so you&#8217;re-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Well, no, but, I mean, also, I know you&#8217;ve talked before about how our parents and grandparents generation, as a baseline, had higher testosterone than-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, Kirk Parsley has some numbers that he quotes that, my grandparents&#8217; generation, both men and women, appeared to have testosterone levels about three times on average what we&#8217;re seeing today. So, yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s probably not optimal from a recovery standpoint. This is the thing, again, we don&#8217;t really know why this is changing. Is it xenoestrogens? Is it a change in the gut microbiome? Is it all of these things?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The stuff that can definitely help, usually something that looks kind of akin to a lower carb diet tends to help, because people lose body fat. It&#8217;s interesting, on the testosterone story, specifically with men, being super lean is antagonistic towards testosterone. So once you get below about 10%, maybe 8%, as a baseline, your testosterone will tend to start dropping because of some stress response issues.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Some people run leaner and high testosterone, but this is, again, you know, kind of generalization. But then once you start cresting up above maybe about 14%, 15% body fat, you have enough fat mass, which contains an enzyme called aromatase, which can convert the testosterone into estrogen. The interesting kind of downward spiral with that is the brain doesn&#8217;t sense testosterone levels, it senses estrogen levels.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So with estrogen levels are high, the brain says, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re good with testosterone, I don&#8217;t need to stimulate luteinizing hormone, and, you know, ping the Leydig cells to, you know, release the precursors and co-factors involved with the whole testosterone production cascade.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So someone who is overweight will have low testosterone, which tends to feed into overweight, which then elevates their estrogen levels, which suppresses testosterone production at the brain. Then even if they go and get some sort of testosterone replacement therapy, if the doctor is ham-handed with this, they just give them a big huge dose of testosterone, which further suppresses indogenous testosterone production.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, with someone like this, some things like zinc citrate have been shown to be pretty effective, about 50 milligrams per day. You have to be careful with doing that consistently, because it can deplete your copper levels.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So when you say careful doing it consistently, like once a week? Every other day?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> You could do it maybe four or five days on, and then take four or five days off, and or you could use a supplement like Jarrow&#8217;s zinc citrate, which comes with copper, five milligrams copper. So, that&#8217;s something to do, is to make sure that you&#8217;re supplementing with that. If your body fat levels are north of about 14, 15, if they&#8217;re in there, then I would try to do some things to get leaner and see if that improves testosterone levels.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Sleep is going to be a huge factor. So, what time are you going to bed? What time are you waking up? What&#8217;s the sleep quality? Completely black room.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Getting in bed before midnight.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Earlier is better. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> As many hours asleep before midnight as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yup, yup, ideally. Which is harder in the summer months, depending on where you are, and what latitude you&#8217;re at. But improving sleep, improving body composition. Those are the places that I would look first, and I would really dig into the diet and lifestyle features first and figure out what if any bump you can get from that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Only then, if we aren&#8217;t seeing favorable changes, do we start working with a knowledgeable functional medicine doctor, like anti-aging doctor. Starting with things like Clomid and some mild aromatase inhibitors and stuff like that to try to goose endogenous production first. Particularly someone that&#8217;s 27, you do not want this person getting into a, you know, a testosterone replacement therapy scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I guess one other question is for Mads, has he ever suffered a significant traumatic brain injury? Sometimes you may not be aware of that, but if you played youth football, if you played hockey, if you fell off of a trampoline. So this could be something too that is part of the sleep piece. If sleep seems to be pretty good, but, you know, everything isn&#8217;t really kicking over, then there can be some sleep studies, there can be some brain imaging and some testing to look at what&#8217;s going on between the pituitary and the other elements of the story. So that&#8217;s kind of getting in another layer.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> It&#8217;s going to be awhile, but we will have some material that&#8217;s going to really help people unpack this stuff in a completely systematic process, because there&#8217;s so much shitty information on this and it&#8217;s so confusing and you need a lot of nuance. There is never a one size fits all approach on this, other than maybe sleep better. That&#8217;s about the only one that, you know, that&#8217;s going to benefit virtually everybody. But occasionally, you have these outliers of people who have a particular type of depression or mania and they actually benefit from certain periods of sleep deprivation.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So again, there&#8217;s an exception to fucking everything. This is why when people just paint everything with these broad brush strokes, there&#8217;s just seemingly an exception to everything. So yeah, I know that I was kind of all over the map on that, but it&#8217;s a lot of stuff. We&#8217;ll be doing some work with Kirk Parsley in the future to get some materials so that people can really navigate this story in an effective way.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is on sex hormone binding globulin elevated on keto carnivore, and this is from Ian, Ian. I&#8217;m not sure how to pronounce your name. Ian says, &#8220;Since switching to keto, I&#8217;ve noticed an increase in sex hormone binding globulin levels, which brings down my free test, total test, or free testosterone. So total testosterone has stayed high normal, but was wondering how functional it is with the free portion bound up? The AGA is a bit low too. I feel great, all in all, but I was just wondering what your thoughts are on that.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, and so the previous question, I should&#8217;ve mentioned the sex hormone binding globulin story as well. It&#8217;s interesting, generally when insulin levels go down on a relative basis, we tend to see sex hormone binding globulin go up. What&#8217;s unclear about that, is it&#8217;s somewhat similar to thyroid, specifically T3, decreasing on low carb, because you need more thyroid hormone to process carbohydrate. If you&#8217;re eating fewer carbohydrates, thyroid decreases, but is that clinically significant? We just don&#8217;t really know.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Another piece of this whole kind of androgen story, and again, this is true whether you&#8217;re male or female, is that you may have a particular level of a hormone that may look kind of low, but you may have particularly high receptor site density or receptor site affinity. So a little bit of the hormone goes a long way. The flip side, is that you could have quite high hormone levels and low receptor site density and or affinity, and so you&#8217;re still not getting, you know, an effective kind of story.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I&#8217;m not entirely sure how to fully unpack that, doing some side of full body radio immunoassay to determine what your receptor site density is. Receptor types change moment by moment too, they come online and offline all the time. So yeah, I mean, I guess the best answer that I have with that is that we could play around with titrating in more carbs, start with 50 additional grams of carbs a day, stick it in the post-workout window. Do you feel better? For both men and women, do you experience better libido? For men, do you wake up with morning wood and stuff like that? Whereas, perhaps previously you did not.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> If we see those things improve, then we might make a case that the insulin levels were suppressed beyond what may be beneficial. So, we may have been getting an unfavorable elevation in sex hormone binding protein or globulin, whatever they&#8217;re calling it these days. So, those are some things to play with on this. These are the, you know, last 10% things for most people that we have to devote some time to unpack.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our final question this week is on chicharrones.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Cha, cha, cha.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> From Isaac. &#8220;Hey, Rob. chicharrones, pork rinds, are they a healthy snack? I&#8217;ve heard you indirectly mention them on the podcast some time ago, but I wasn&#8217;t able to infer whether your opinion is favorable or cautionary. I&#8217;m an ultra runner and during peak training season we&#8217;ll spend about 20 hours per week running. In the battle days, I would top off my calories with a gigantic bowl of cold cereal in the evening or an enormous serving of lentils and rice. But then I got woke, started monitoring my blood sugar and started looking for low carb options to fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I&#8217;m already having two salads each day, huge amounts of veggies and as much meat as I can stomach. So I&#8217;m just looking for some calories to fuel the movement. So are pork rinds okay? I avoid the flavored variety, the bags I buy just say fried pork skin on the ingredients list and I dip them in sour cream. The best part is how easy it is to get an extra thousand calories, and the flavor. Am I headed towards clogged arteries? Or are pork rinds actually healthy in the way that bacon is healthy? Thanks. Love the show, Isaac.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> He says, &#8220;After submitting my question about whether pork rinds are an acceptable snack, I realize that Rob&#8217;s answer might we&#8217;d need to see your lab work.&#8221; So then he has his cholesterol and some of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That&#8217;s doing some diligence. We don&#8217;t have an LEO. Oh, do we? No, we have lipoprotein, ApoB. Oh, he does, yes. LDL particle is 1149, that looks phenomenal. Quick triglyceride, HDL ratio looks great. C-reactive protein is tiny. Okay, cool. Those numbers we&#8217;ll put in the show notes.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, this is one of these funny things. So, Rhonda Patrick, who I think is great, but pork rinds have been one of the things that she&#8217;s just gone after. She&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just still unhealthy, you know? There&#8217;s no nutritional value there.&#8221; Which I mean, there&#8217;s not a lot of vitamins, there&#8217;s probably not a lot of minerals particularly, but it is a really interesting source of collagen. When you&#8217;re in this kind of lower carb, unprocessed food world, there&#8217;s not much that&#8217;s crunchy. You&#8217;ll grab a piece of ice just to be like, &#8220;Oh, man, I want some sort of crunch.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We&#8217;ll do some jicama thin sliced every once in a while. But you just kind of, you miss that crunch, and chicharrones are phenomenal for that. Typically, they&#8217;re cooked in pork fat. I guess you could make the case that maybe some of that stuff is producing some oxidized cholesterol. But I was just reading some stuff recently that people in ketosis, their liver preferentially identifies lipo proteins with oxidized cholesterol and removes them from the system.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, it&#8217;s kind of an interesting story, where even though cholesterol levels, possibly even lipo protein levels may go up under a ketogenic or low carb diet, your body also seems to be more savvy about removing the offending particles that appear to be the most problematic. So, it&#8217;s kind of, you know, is that a wash? Is it a net win? A net loss?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> With the option of always modifying my position in the future, I would say, in general, I can&#8217;t really see pork rinds in the context of a keto carnivore type diet being the least bit problematic. The cool thing here is that Issac has done the diligence of doing some good blood work that actually answers some questions. Even just glancing at it, it&#8217;s kind of like, okay, we&#8217;re pretty good to go. We don&#8217;t have any type of wacky discordance, we don&#8217;t have hidden insulin resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> There&#8217;s a few other things we could take a peek out if we wanted to. But from reading between the lines, it sounds like he&#8217;s looking, feeling, performing well, but he&#8217;s just kind of curious about like, &#8220;Hey, is this one thing that I&#8217;m throwing down the pie hole going to crush me?&#8221; So, I would just repeat this blood work, probably once a year or something like that, to just use as a baseline. Maybe at some point, additionally doing a coronary calcium, just so you&#8217;ve got that in your back pocket, and we can use that again as a baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The CIMT can be handy also, but it takes a very skilled practitioner to do the CIMT well. So those are a little bit of a mixed bag and they&#8217;re a little more variable than the coronary calcium. But beyond that it seems good. You know, I will make a plug for the Epic pork rinds. They have a barbecue flavor, a sea salt and vinegar and salt and pepper.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Salt and pepper is really good.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, and the barbecue one, the kids &#8230; It literally can-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> They have a baked one too.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, they do have a baked one, which I like less, honestly. I like the ones that are fried in pork fat. But either one of the flavors, but mainly the barbecue flavor will provoke the girls into a fist fight, practically, as they get down to the bottom of the bag. Which I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad, but they&#8217;re good, they&#8217;re tasty.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> The dog likes them too.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The dog definitely likes them too.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> The bag comes out and he hears it, and he&#8217;s right there sitting, pleading.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So Isaac, good question, and good on you for doing some diligence on your blood work. It&#8217;s incredibly frustrating when people spend time and money to go get an assessment that answers nothing. This is another area that we&#8217;re going to be dipping our toes into to help people make better decisions around the lab work that they&#8217;re choosing, why they&#8217;re choosing it. So keep your eyes open for that too.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Making sense of it once they get it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, because literally, 90% of the time, 95% of the time, people do blood work and they&#8217;re more confused by what is ordered than otherwise. It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s just not enough to really make a definitive call in general.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right. That was our last question for the week. Thanks everyone. As usual, if you have questions, you can submit those at Robbwolf.com on the contact page. What else?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Most of my online activity currently is over at Instagram at dasrobbwolf.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> D-A-S-R-O-B-B-W-O-L-F.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That&#8217;s it. So, thanks for the awesome questions. You guys are fantastic, and-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We&#8217;ll be back next week.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We&#8217;ll be back next week. We may be a little bit hit and miss between now and August, mid August, because we&#8217;re going to be moving and stuff like that. We&#8217;re going to try to bank some of these so that we stay ahead of stuff. It&#8217;s possible that life may just grab us by the shorthairs, so in demand that that doesn&#8217;t happen. But we will do our best to stay on top of. Yup.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right. Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Bye.</p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/oK7839eteXQ">Thoughts on Baby Led Weaning?</a></b> [1:38]</p>
<p>Rory says:</p>
<p>We follow Chris Kresser&#8217;s Healthy Baby Code when introducing foods to our children, starting with purees, and graduating to solid foods overtime.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s recently learned of &#8220;baby-led weaning&#8221; (completely unscientific aside: anything that starts with &#8220;baby-led&#8221; CAN&#8217;T be a good idea. Like &#8220;baby-led&#8221; bedtime, or &#8220;baby-led&#8221; TV-watching).</p>
<p>The theory, as I understand it, is that you present your kid with chunks of various foods, and let them choose what to eat based on their tastes, rather than forcing a puree of some kind that they may not prefer if they weren&#8217;t being fed by you.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
<p>I know your kids are obviously Paleo, and we&#8217;re curious how you navigated the introduction of foods and respect for their preferences as their tastes developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. <a href="https://youtu.be/eWT8nf1rYC4">Post-Lunch Coma On Keto</a> </b>[10:15]</p>
<p>Laura says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb and Nicki,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding an incessant post lunch coma regardless of diet.</p>
<p>I have experienced a mean bout of fatigue and extreme cold every day following lunch for much of my adult life. I’ve been on the paleo bandwagon for almost 10 years with marginal improvement in that area, and recently doing keto I’ve experienced only a little bit of relief. I still get almost debilitatingly fatigued and cold after eating lunch. If I have a sweet potato or a piece of fruit with lunch it’s definitely a lot worse, but even with my typical lunch of leftover protein and veggies or a version of Mark Sisson’s “big ass salad,” I experience a couple hours of wanting to get in bed after lunch. I follow the ketogains recommendations on electrolyte tracking and consumption of electrolytes. For breakfast I usually have some variation of 3-4 eggs.</p>
<p>I’m a 33 year old female, healthy weight, CrossFit 2-3 times/week. My recent lab work was excellent, low inflammatory markers, lipids and blood sugar markers all good. T3 was on the low end of normal, but all other thyroid measures WNL. I am mindful of circadian rhythms and do all I can to optimize sleep, however it isn’t ideal as I have a toddler and baby. I don’t think they can totally be blamed for the issue, though, as I have experienced this for many years. Thanks for your time and for the profound impact you’ve had on my life and the lives of many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3.<a href="https://youtu.be/oD5kx5_TDOI"> Help! Balding! </a></b>[16:33]</p>
<p>Mehdi says:</p>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have messaged before.</p>
<p>What is your advice for a 28 year old male having male pattern baldness?</p>
<p>Is it really Genetic destiny or is there any way of living eating exercising sleeping etc that can keep my hair.</p>
<p>Please help&#8230;</p>
<p>I don’t know where to turn.</p>
<p>Do you guys recommend my good sources for male pattern baldness info?</p>
<p>I read the Mark Sisson article and I don’t think I suffer from any of the conditions he mentions.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Mehdi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. <a href="https://youtu.be/57C2gBfzjvk">Portion Sizes like Eddie the Strongman </a></b>[19:09]</p>
<p>Kevin says:</p>
<p>Hi! Can you give a little help in the way of portion sizes. I have been eating Paleo/low carb (grain/dairy/legume free) for about a year and I feel like I have just recently stopped craving sugar (feels liberating). I am extremely active due to my work 5’9”, 145 lean male. In order to feel full my meals (3 or 4 a day) are absolutely giant. Usually I have focused on about 8-10oz of protein per meal and fill the rest with giant vegetable portions. Recently due to all that veg bloating the heck out of my belly I have switched to more like 16-20oz of protein and a bit less veg to cut down on the bloating. This feels better but It seems like a ton and I was wondering how this compares to others. Basically for every meal recently I throw 16-20oz’s of protein in a 10.5 inch or 12inch cast iron skillet, cook the protein with a fat and fill the pan to the top with veg. I thoroughly enjoy this but when I explain to some folks I put Down 16ish oz’s of beef/pork/fish/chicken they look at me like I will have colon cancer within the calendar year. I admit I am too darn active but I have no choice due to work then play. (light details but I work in the mountains above 8000ft and am self powered everywhere I go with a large pack). Sleep is descent, as I work emergency services and sometimes will be up all night working, but not the norm, tons of sun, weight is good I think,&nbsp; blood work appears good. Any suggestions on these portion sizes? I feel like I am going to eat myself into bankruptcy but need to feed the beast to keep my energy up. I tinker on/off with safe starches but I feel like these make me more hungry and I am more satisfied with higher protein. I have also played with carb night like refeeds per John kiefer when I am running a touch light weight/low energy which gives me a bit of a recharge (still avoiding grains/dairy/legumes during the re feed). I generally use fat for flavor per your suggestion as if I go big on fat it makes me kind of nauseous and get less than ideal bowel movements. Although it has been a year on paleo (coming off of 15years of vegetarianism) I feel like I have yet to find the optimal balance and am constantly tinkering. My body comp has changed drastically, as I have noticed I now have muscles and carry about 3-5 extra lbs I believe is muscle. Help me please, I Very much enjoy your work, you are a good person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. <a href="https://youtu.be/GtY8AJKf7GA">Creatine &amp; Cold Sores?! </a></b>[25:58]</p>
<p>Chris says:</p>
<p>Hey, Robb and Nicki!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a long time listener and a fan of both formats, but super glad that you guys decided to bring back the Q&amp;A&#8217;s!&nbsp; Each week, I look forward to listening to your Jedi-like paleo wisdom. But enough about you, let&#8217;s talk about me. The vein of my existence since my late teens has been the occasional cold sore.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been paleo/ckd for about 4 years now, which has decreased the occurrence from about 4-5 times a year to only once or twice a year. Still, I absolutely dread the day that one of those little suckers shows up, and I do everything in my power to prevent that from happening.&nbsp; Since arginine seems to be an antagonist to the virus, I do my best to avoid it all costs, and supplement with L-lysine as well. This brings me to my question, which pertains to creatine. I have been thinking about starting to supplement with creatine, but when doing research I realized that it is actually made up of the three specific amino acids: methionine, glycine, and &#8212; yep, ariginine.&nbsp; Now I am worried that supplementing with creatine will cause a dreaded outbreak. Is this accurate or am overanalyzing? Would supplementing with lysine at the same time help prevent arginine dominance in the cells or is that nonsense? Any other tips on prevention? I&#8217;ve scoured the interwebs for an answer to no avail and would truly appreciate your input, Paleo-Wan-Kenobi. Thank you for what you do and keep up the good work!</p>

<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Oh, hey. Don&#8217;t let me stop you from doing what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You have hot coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Oh, hot is relative. It&#8217;s warmer than what I would like to expose my mucus membranes to, but, yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Anything new you want to share?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Probably doing some jiu-jitsu today with Nelson Puentes, the founder of Inverted Gears.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So I&#8217;m hoping that that happens later today.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Is he in Reno?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> He&#8217;s in Reno.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Didn&#8217;t tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> He just pinged me yesterday, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> That&#8217;s exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. So I get some Puentes smashitude today, hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right, should we jump into our questions?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Well, let&#8217;s wade into him. Let&#8217;s take our time and go safely.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Well this the first one is on baby-led weaning from Rory. And he says, &#8220;We follow Chris Kresser&#8217;s Healthy Baby Code when introducing foods to our children, starting with purees and graduating to solid foods over time.&#8221; She&#8217;s recently learned of baby-led weaning. Completely unscientific aside, anything that starts with baby-led, it can&#8217;t be a good idea, like baby-led bedtime or baby-led TV watching. Baby-led bedtime is definitely not a good. Toddler-led bedtime and seven-year-old-led bedtime is also not a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;The theory, as I understand it, is that you present your kid with chunks of various foods and let them choose what to eat based on their tastes rather than forcing a puree of some kind that they may not prefer if they weren&#8217;t being fed by you. Your thoughts? I know your kids are obviously Paleo and we&#8217;re curious how you navigated the introduction of foods and respect for their preferences as their tastes develop.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We have no respect for them. We just force food on them and told them, &#8220;This is a hard life, kids. The sooner you learn that better.&#8221; Or not really. So I did two blog posts on feeding kids Paleo, so we should definitely link to those. They&#8217;re old now, but I mean everybody else&#8217;s kids go through the same-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Our kids are old now.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;Yeah. They go through these cycles and&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I guess the tough, I mean, some of the baby-led stuff. I mean, Zoe loved liver. We&#8217;d cook a piece of beef liver or chicken liver and she would just hold it and suck on it. Bacon, apples&#8230; For me, and I don&#8217;t know if this is just like a paranoid mom thing, but the choking thing was, and Zoe in particular, we did the finger sweep of her throat probably-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Well, even when she was three, maybe four, we were traveling, we were in a whole foods doing like the food bar and I had to get up and do the back strike. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. She was our one that was prone to gagging and choking on food.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Because she has a tendency of only chewing her food like twice. Might be a genetic predilection there. And then she tries to swallow it whole.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> She does take after me.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Readers of The Paleo Solution might recall&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Right. Recognize the reference.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, we did that stuff, but we also&#8230; So this is one of the things, so for the little little ones, when they&#8217;re just transitioning, what was really interesting, and we had a fair amount of pushback around this, even from our good friend Eva T., but I think she was kind of misguided on that. We would puree a food and the kids were totally ho-hum about it, but if we just chewed it a little bit and then like took it and slapped it in their mouth, they ate it. Like they, it was-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Because they&#8217;re fixated on what you&#8217;re eating and if you give them, you know, it was mainly meat that we did that with.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. So that was interesting. And if you think about the whole gut microbiome thing and all that stuff, it&#8217;s kind of an intriguing story. When you look at the way that traditional cultures deal with a lot of the processes that we see as being unsanitary, and maybe this is why a lot of people die young, due to infectious disease, but I think that there&#8217;s some upsides too, so&#8230; Are we actually answering this question? I mean we&#8217;re kind of bouncing around.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. So how did we navigate the introduction of foods and respect for their preferences?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Some of it was chewing food.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, we offered them things and like avocado, sweet potato, they both really liked sweet potato early on. Both the orange yam ones, the purple kind of Hawaiian-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah, the purple sweet, and that was a funny thing too. Both of them loved all that stuff earlier and I don&#8217;t know if we burned them out or what, but now they don&#8217;t really eat it that well. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And if they didn&#8217;t like it, we would&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Put it back in the rotation maybe six months later.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;d wait a little while and then offer it to them again.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> What was that deal, like, we entered&#8230; Neither one of our kids did the projectile vomiting of eggs. The egg yolk was the thing to introduce to the kids, but we actually punted that because everything we read, seemed like 50% of the kids projectile vomited. But we didn&#8217;t have a problem with that. One problem we&#8217;ve had is fruit, even to this day where particularly summertime rolls around and-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Zoe would get a rash from pineapple. She loved pineapple. She&#8217;d eat a ton of it. This was just like 11 months old, 12 months old. And then she had a rash all over her legs, so we had to cut back the pineapple.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Well, and they will get the trots too. Like they&#8217;ll eat fruit until they&#8217;re shitting like geese. And it&#8217;s tough because it gets hot and you want something simple-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And they like it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;And you don&#8217;t want to arm wrestle with them over everything and they like it. So it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh man.&#8221; You just keep on chopping off logs of watermelon or apples. Both. We&#8217;ve noticed apples are kind of rough on both kids.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> If they eat too many apples, they&#8217;ll both complain that their stomach hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. But again, I feel like we&#8217;re kind of bouncing around this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. We didn&#8217;t do the baby, like the baby led weaning, at least as I understand it, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re putting whole pieces of stuff out there and then they&#8217;re tasting it and just going to what they gravitate towards. We sort of, whatever we cooked, we gave them some version of that. Whether it was sweet potato, pieces of cooked broccoli, fruit, meat, like you said, chewed it first. And there are things that they clearly spit out and didn&#8217;t like and we just waited and tried it again.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. It is interesting though, when you look at the detox pathways in children. Kids seem to have a more attuned sense for bitter tastes, which mainly comes from plants. So even to the degree that they ate greens, it was just like the very greeniest tip top of the broccoli.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. Broccoli, just the tip. Like the leafy part.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The very end of the floret. Yeah. Yeah. So when you think about a nutrient density kind of story, like they smashed meat, they really went after liver. Sagan liked butter a lot, Zoe not so much, which was interesting. I mean, Sagan would ask for just a slice of butter to eat. It makes a ton of sense to me that the kids are gravitating towards these more nutrient dense foods we figured out with like salads, we don&#8217;t do a ton of salads, we do some salad, but we figured out like three different dressings. You do a apple cider vinegar, olive oil-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Olive oil, one clove of garlic and a lot of salt</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And then puree that and put it on the salad.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s now, and they&#8217;re almost five and seven.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right. But they wouldn&#8217;t eat that stuff at all without that. But even to the degree they eat that, you put that dressing on ahead of time and it almost kind of breaks stuff down because of the acid load. So it&#8217;s interesting. I think that there&#8217;s some pretty, I think people get overly concerned about getting greens into their kids. It&#8217;ll happen when it&#8217;s supposed to happen. If you get sufficient animal products in them, they&#8217;re not going to be nutrient deficient.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And we made a lot of soups.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We did make a lot of soups.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We always do a lot of soups, especially in the winter. So we would just puree that and they would eat that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> One side note, I remember reading about this stuff, like if you want your kids to eat things better and it&#8217;s kind of a pain in the ass, but if you cut things smaller, the kids will tend to eat more. And not surprisingly, this is also one of the things that we see-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Makes things more hyperpalatable.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Makes it more hyperpalatable. So when when people tend to overeat, it&#8217;s when things are super cut up and well processed and everything. But again, I think that there&#8217;s some interesting kind of evolutionary biology on just observing how kids eat, like they tend to gravitate towards nutrient dense foods, they seem to have a real aversion towards things that could potentially be toxic, mainly like bitter type substances and stuff like that. What else? What else? You definitely see the dangers of hyperpalatable foods real quickly with kids, so yeah. Yeah. And man, that was all over the place, for an otherwise simple question. But I mean, there&#8217;s a lot going on.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> It&#8217;s because we had our first kid seven years ago and so the sleep deprivation that has ensued since then-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And we&#8217;re old.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Like, we can sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We should be having grandkids now instead of kids.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right. Thanks Rory. Let&#8217;s see, our next question is from Laura on a post-lunch coma on keto.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki</strong>: &#8220;Hi Robb and Nicki. I have a question regarding an incessant post-lunch coma regardless of diet. I&#8217;ve experienced a mean bout of fatigue and extreme cold everyday following lunch for much of my adult life. I&#8217;ve been on the Paleo bandwagon for almost 10 years with marginal improvement in that area, and recently doing keto, I&#8217;ve experienced only a little bit of relief. I still get almost debilitatingly fatigued and cold after eating lunch. If I have a sweet potato or a piece of fruit with lunch, it&#8217;s definitely a lot worse. But even with my typical lunch of leftover protein and veggies or a version of Mark Sisson&#8217;s Big-Ass Salad, I experience a couple of hours of wanting to get in bed after lunch. I follow the KetoGains recommendations on electrolyte tracking and consumption of electrolytes. For breakfast I usually have some variation of three to four eggs. I&#8217;m 33 years old, female, healthy weight, CrossFit two to three times a week. My recent lab work was excellent, low inflammatory markers, lipids and blood sugar markers all good. T3 was on the low end of normal, but all other thyroid measures within normal&#8230;&#8221; Is that within normal limits?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Limits. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;I am mindful of Circadian Rhythms and do all I can to optimize sleep, however it isn&#8217;t ideal as I have a toddler and a baby. I don&#8217;t think they can totally be blamed for the issue though, as I have experienced this for many years. Thanks for your time and for the profound impact you&#8217;ve had on my life and the lives of many others.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So I guess one question&#8230; So, when I was first reading through this, I was like electrolyte elect, oh, okay. She&#8217;s doing the electrolyte. So that was one thing that I was thinking about. The other thing that I&#8217;m curious, does Laura experience this with breakfast or dinner or is this purely a lunch phenomena, and-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I think she would say it, if it was after every meal. She specifically says-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, but you know how people are. I&#8217;m sure Laura is super crackerjack, but if she&#8217;s like &#8220;Oh yeah, it does happen with breakfast and dinner.&#8221; So a couple of thoughts are maybe a low stomach acid kind of scenario. This thing is sounding almost more like a gut permeability, like, histamine response. It&#8217;s sounding like something other than just blood sugar specifically.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> If folks read Wired to Eat, you should recall that we have the blood sugar piece as a stand alone of just dietary carbohydrate, but we also have the immunogenic potential of food, and the bugger is that if we have, I think it was last week, we talked about digestive enzymes and all that stuff potentially helping with food reactivity, because if the food is super well-digested and broken down because of adequate acid load in the stomach and then digestive enzymes, then we have the appropriate things hitting the gut lining instead of intact proteins that can cause a response.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So that would be some stuff I would tinker with, like betaine hydrochloride capsules, apple cider vinegar capsules, maybe some sort of pancreatin enzyme that you throw down with the meal. Also, doing a 15 minute, 10 minute meditation post-meal I think could be huge. Any way that we can get into that parasympathetic state and kind of activate the vagal nerve so that we&#8217;re getting blood flow and enervation to the GI tract and so that we&#8217;re in that digest and rest mode could actually be helpful. It&#8217;s interesting when you&#8217;re used to stimulants and coffee and all that stuff. That&#8217;s one type of energy. But being restful and not stressed is interestingly, and it&#8217;s energetic too, but it&#8217;s very different than like, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. So I guess the thoughts that I would have, try doing some sort of a meditation practice, post-lunch if you can, if you can fit that in, even doing five minutes of-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Well, not even post-lunch, but if you got into a routine where you did it in the morning and in the afternoon, the morning sit might help with the post-lunch fatigue.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Later. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Because if she&#8217;s already tired, I could see her starting to sit and just like nodding off.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Nodding off. Could be, could be. But I would definitely noodle on some sort of a meditation practice, getting plugged into that, and then additionally the digestive support. And then beyond that. I got nothing beyond that. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Let us know, Laura, though. Like if you try the digestive support and it works, then let us know. If it doesn&#8217;t work then let us know, and maybe Robb will, something else will joggle in his mind.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Do some additional noodling, yeah. And you know, she mentioned the T3 was on the low end of normal. This is kind of looking at cholesterol to some degree, but the way that thyroid is generally assessed, they should be looking at T3, T4, reverse T3, thyroid uptake, TSH, and you really need the whole picture that you&#8217;re looking at with that. Plus we still need to then just ask the question, &#8220;Okay, do we see any clinical signs of problems?&#8221; And definitely thyroid is really important for basic metabolic rate. The fact that she mentioned cold multiple times, and she actually gets cold after a meal?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Normally you get hot after a meal, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> If anything, you should get warm after a meal. So that thyroid piece is something that it would be worth nosing around a little bit if you-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> If they didn&#8217;t do the full thyroid.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, and virtually nobody does. If you little bit of googling on functional medicine thyroid panel, then you&#8217;ll see the full suite that you should get on that. Chris Kresser has talked about it. Chris Masterjohn has talked about it. I think that we&#8217;ve posted on that previously. But that&#8217;s the only other thing that&#8217;s kind of rattling back there is potential low, legitimate low thyroid for you, even if you&#8217;re within normal ranges. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is from Medi. He says, it&#8217;s on balding, and he says, &#8220;Hello. What is your advice for a 28-year-old male having male pattern baldness? Is it really genetic destiny, or is there any way of living, eating, exercising, sleeping, et cetera that can help me keep my hair? Please help. I don&#8217;t know where to turn. Do you guys recommend any good sources for male pattern baldness information? I read Mark Sisson&#8217;s article and I don&#8217;t think I suffer from any of the conditions he mentions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. So this is one of the things that we really don&#8217;t see in pre-agricultural societies. I think that there&#8217;s a genetic predisposition here and it relates to the conversion of testosterone and DHT, dihydrotestosterone, and this can kind of overwhelm the receptors and the hair follicles, particularly in this area, and that plus a kind of overly elevated insulin environment seems to be kind of the synergy that produces it. So a lower insulin load could be certainly helpful. And then there have been some products, I&#8217;m blanking&#8230; Like the basic Rogaine-type stuff where people will apply something to the scalp. Those things really work. They work remarkably well for most people. Tend to have pretty minimal side effects because you&#8217;re not taking these substances internally. You do get some internal activity, but because it&#8217;s topical you don&#8217;t get as much. But the two thoughts are to look into something like these Rogaine-type products and then also making sure the insulin load is properly addressed. And then sleep and exercise and all the other things that help you deal with that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I have a friend who swears also by scalp massage and handstands to increase the blood flow. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any science behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> What friend is this? You don&#8217;t have to name the name, but&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Somebody that I see when I go to my Austin stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So I don&#8217;t know if there is something to that but it&#8217;s worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I&#8217;ll put that one on very much the anecdotal, not a lot of&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> But hey, doing handstands are good for you.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Handstands are good for you. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And scalp massages feels good.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> There you go. Reduce cortisol and maybe everything works out. So yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Anything else on that one?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Nope. Nope. I don&#8217;t want to beat that one any more. Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. All right. Our next question is from Kevin, portion sizes like Eddie the strongman.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;Hi. Can you give a little help in the way of portion sizes? I have been eating Paleo, low carb, grain-dairy-legume free for about a year and I feel like I&#8217;ve just recently stopped craving sugar and it feels liberating. I&#8217;m extremely active due to my work. I&#8217;m 5&#8217;9&#8221;, 145 pounds, lean male. In order to feel full, my meals, three or four a day, are absolutely giant. Usually I have focused on about eight to 10 ounces of protein per meal and fill the rest with giant vegetable portions.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;Recently, due to all that vegetable bloating the heck out of my belly, I&#8217;ve switched to more like 16 to 20 ounces of protein and a bit less veggies to cut down on the bloating. This feels better but it seems like a ton and I was wondering how this compares to others. Basically for every meal recently I throw 16 to 20 ounces of protein in a 10 and a half inch or 12 inch cast iron skillet, cook the protein with a fat and then fill the pan to the top with veggies. I thoroughly enjoy this, but when I explained to some folks I put down 16 or so ounces of beef, pork, fish, chicken, they look at me like I will have colon cancer within the calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;I admit I am too darn active, but I have no choice due to work then play. Light details, but I work in the mountains above 8,000 feet and I&#8217;m self powered everywhere I go with a large pack. Sleep is decent, as I work emergency services and sometimes we&#8217;ll be up all night working, but not the norm. We get tons of sun, weight is good I think, blood work appears good. Any suggestions on these portion sizes? I feel like I&#8217;m going to eat myself into bankruptcy, but need to feed the beast to keep my energy up. I tinker on-off with safe starches, but I feel like these make me more hungry and I&#8217;m more satisfied with the higher protein. I&#8217;ve also played with Carb Nite-like refeeds per John Key for when I&#8217;m running a touch lightweight or low on energy, which gives me a bit of a recharge, but I&#8217;m still avoiding grains, dairy, and legumes during the refeed.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I generally use fat for flavor per your suggestion, as if I go big on fat, it makes me kind of nauseous and I get less than ideal bowel movements. Although it has been a year on Paleo coming off of 15 years of vegetarianism, I feel like I&#8217;ve yet to find the optimal balance and I&#8217;m constantly tinkering. My body comp has changed drastically as I&#8217;ve noticed I now have muscles and carry about three to five extra pounds that I believe is muscle. Help me please. I very much enjoy your work. You are a good person.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, I mean the main question here is, is he eating too much protein and is he going to get the cancers from it and all that stuff. I did a talk on will low carb diets shorten your life, and as part of that I dig into this thing called the mid-Victorian diet and it&#8217;s really interesting because it looks at people living in the UK, the mid-Victorian era, early 1800s. Food quality was pretty low, health was poor. As food distribution networks get better established and some improvements in animal husbandry and farming practices occur, people eat more fish, people eat a lot more protein from ruminants in particular and then more fruit. And not surprisingly, there&#8217;s about an 80 year period there that this occurs, and people get taller, they get healthier, their average lifespan is as good as what it is today, or I do believe, even better. And this is pre-antibiotics, pre-surgery, all this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And then they start industrializing their food system and everybody gets, like there&#8217;s six inches of height loss, the lifespan plummets until 1940, 1950 do we start seeing a food system that&#8217;s able to feed people adequately to start outdoing some of that stuff. So these folks were very, very active. The males on average ate about 4,500 to 5,000 calories a day. They had an activity level that supported that. The women were very, very active, too. Similar caloric intake to a smaller body frame. And these people were not succumbing to the diseases of, you know, western degenerative disease, because they ate a largely whole unprocessed diet. They got adequate protein, which was quite a lot of protein, at least a gram of protein per pound of body weight was kind of the norm for these folks, and good nutrient density. So on the one hand, there&#8217;s nothing compelling about this that has me worried about the cancer and you know, what is it from Deadpool, El Cancer? How do you say cancer in Spanish? El cancer?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So I&#8217;m just not, you know&#8230; And then part of the question too is like, okay, what else are you going to do? You&#8217;ve tinkered with eating more starchy type things and you don&#8217;t feel as good and you actually get more hungry, which is kind of the thing that I&#8217;ve experienced and is this kind of roller coaster I&#8217;m always on, and it was kind of the magic of the first time I went low carb. I wasn&#8217;t always hungry. And I know that for some people, like if you get real geeked out on the endocrinology, insulin should be anorexigenic. It should make you full. And I think in normal people, like normal human physiology, that should be true. But not that many of us are normal. There&#8217;s different elements of gut dysbiosis, different elements of kind of broken at. And so it sounds like what Kevin is doing is working. I appreciate that it&#8217;s probably not the cheapest way to eat, but you&#8217;re also investing in your health and your longterm physicality.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And he is so incredibly active, like if his activity level dropped&#8230; But it sounds like it can&#8217;t because that&#8217;s his work. He probably would drop that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right. And again, I&#8217;ve experienced the same thing where if I add too much outside fat, I get the trots, also. That you have some support helps that, for sure. Betaine hydrochloride, the apple cider vinegar caps. It sounds like just fat absorption may be a real issue. So doing something like ox bile, which helps you to emulsify and absorb those fats. And then tinkering with, like I noticed that starches I don&#8217;t do&#8230; Not well with, like I, so-so, but real small amounts, but like berries and melons, to the degree I can tolerate things, berries, melons, mangoes, papaya. Oddly enough, the high-glycemic load tropical fruits actually do comparatively okay on, it tends to not give me massive GI problems and I tend to not have as much of the blood sugar highs and lows, to the degree that I&#8217;d stick those in the rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our last question is on creatine and cold sores. This question is from Chris. &#8220;Hey Robb and Nicki. I&#8217;m a longtime listener and a fan of both formats, but super glad that you guys decided to bring back the Q and A&#8217;s. Each week I look forward to listening to your Jedi-like Paleo wisdom. But enough about you. Let&#8217;s talk about me. The vane of my existence since my late teens.&#8221; The vein of&#8230; The bane of my existence.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Should be bane. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. &#8220;Since my late teens has been the occasional cold sore. I&#8217;ve been Paleo cyclic ketogenic for about four years now, which has decreased the occurrence from about four to five times a year to only once or twice a year. Still, I absolutely dread the day that one of those little suckers shows up, and I do everything in my power to prevent that from happening. Since arginine seems to be an antagonist to the virus, I do my best to avoid it at all costs and supplement with L glycine as well.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;This brings me to my question, which pertains to creatine. I have been thinking about starting to supplement with creatine, but when doing research, I realized that is actually made up of the three specific amino acids methionine, glycine, and yep, arginine. Now I&#8217;m worried that supplementing with creatine will cause a dreaded outbreak. Is this accurate or am I over-analyzing? Would supplementing with lysine at the same time prevent arginine dominance in the cells or is that nonsense? Any other tips on prevention? I&#8217;ve scoured the interwebs for an answer to no avail and would appreciate your input, Paleo Wan Kenobi. Thank you for what you do and keep up the good work.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I&#8217;m perplexed by this. Do you want to do a little Google searching in here, wife?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> What do you want me to Google? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Creatine structure. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that creatine is made up of those&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Want me to click on-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, creatine structure. Because it&#8217;s a fairly simple, it&#8217;s all the phosphate backbone. Where&#8217;s the backbone to attach phosphates? I don&#8217;t get where the notion that creatine is containing arginine and this other, well, arginine in particular. So I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s an issue at all. One, he&#8217;s doing great management using the lysine. You can use lysine, both topical creams that I&#8217;m blanking on the name of the outfit, but they have a lysine cream that you can use, and then just taking lysine prophylactically with meals is a great idea. I don&#8217;t think that the arginine is going to be remotely an issue in the case with creatine, because&#8230; Maybe he&#8217;s looked at some formulas that have these other amino acids in the mix, but that is not the backbone of creatine. So, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Do cold sores happen when you&#8217;re more rundown?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Absolutely do. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Isn&#8217;t that when you&#8217;re kind of like-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. They absolutely do.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So maybe it&#8217;s like trying to manage, clearly, sleep and all these other lifestyle factors to keep you more&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I mean the more immunocompromised you are, the more likely you are&#8230; And it&#8217;s one of those signs of things kind of going sideways. Arginine can definitely be a growth promoter, whereas lysine tends to be a growth inhibitor on the cold sore viruses. This is not, but to your point, it&#8217;s similar to folks that, they get shingles occasionally. Like somebody will get super rundown, they get mono and then on the tail end of mono they end up with shingles because they&#8217;re very immune-compromised and these viruses can sense when the immune system is somewhat compromised and they will ramp up viral replication cause they&#8217;ve got a little window of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Might be interesting, Chris, if you kind of pay attention, the next time you get one, what would the two weeks leading up to that looking like? Were you super stressed and have tons of, kind of, stuff going on in your life? And then at least you have that baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That baseline. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki</strong>: And then if you feel yourself kind of going into a mode like that, you can kind of try to take a step back if it&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> For sure. And yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Do some self care.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. But as far as the baseline, like I don&#8217;t see, unless I&#8217;m totally failing my, if I need my biochemist card revoked, I don&#8217;t see how arginine is a player in the structure of creatine.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. I think that was our last question for the-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Cool. Okay. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I don&#8217;t think so. We&#8217;re trying to&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Trying to bank some of these.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Stock some of these up just because summer is coming, believe it or not, and our kids are going to be out of school, so it&#8217;s good-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, like Game of Thrones, winter is coming and chaos ensues.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> For us it&#8217;s summer is coming. So we want to try to make sure we don&#8217;t leave you guys high and dry over the summer. So we&#8217;re going to&#8230; And it definitely will be a little more challenging with the kids home.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. And we&#8217;re going to be moving.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We&#8217;re going to be moving.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So we will be attempting to bank these, but keep sending in questions. We will get to those.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. You can submit those at the contact page on robbwolf.com.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And most of the activity I&#8217;m doing online currently is @dasrobbwolf on Instagram. We have some interesting stuff cooking now. We&#8217;ll let you guys know about that more as that rolls out. So yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. And as always, our show sponsor this week is drink Elements. All of your electrolyte needs with none of the dodgy stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Oh, and to that point, just saw it this morning, literally haven&#8217;t even read the paper yet, but the, I guess the headline with the actual scientific paper is, &#8220;How much sodium are you consuming&#8230; Probably not enough.&#8221; And just in the very quick glance that I looked at on that, it said that folks should be getting at least three to five grams of sodium per day. There&#8217;s probably some outliers, some exceptions around there, but this scores up very nicely with what we saw from the Type 2 diabetic heart patients and the U curve in that population with the low ebb of morbidity, mortality being at five grams of intake per day. So, we&#8217;re not crazy, apparently, recommending supplemental sodium. And from the results that people have been getting, it seems like it&#8217;s working pretty well for people.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right guys. See you next time.</p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p><b> 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/2R7uNaA70ac">Enzymes and IBS? </a></b>[3:32]</p>
<p>Ken says:</p>
<p>Talk to us about enzymes Robb. I&#8217;ve played with alot of different things over the years to help with IBS issues. For a long time I was devoted to probiotics but I never found any real consistent results with them. I took a stool test a year or so ago and discovered that literally none of the strains of probiotics I had so diligently taken (and paid for) were significantly present. Along the way anti fungals and anti parasitic medication (Dr Rx&#8217;d) helped calm the fire down below but it was enzymes that seem to seem to have made the final difference for me. Not only is the fire largely out I&#8217;ve really not had to keep up with taking enzymes like I did with probiotics. To be fair to probiotics they seem to help in the moment but I get the sense you have to take them daily which does not seem to be the case with enzymes. I should mention I know several people that have had the same experience with probiotics and enzymes. My question then is what is the mechanism at work? I get that enzymes help break down foods but why would that help with IBS symptoms and furthermore why would those symptoms be largely gone after only 6 months or so of using them but not taking them daily even?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/DCJ__w-OWos">Squat Pooping and Toilet Training </a></b>[10:42]</p>
<p>Terrence says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb and Nicki!</p>
<p>Loving the new Q&amp;A format! You have done such a great job educating the public on what to put in one end of their bodies that I want to take a moment to talk about how to get the most out of what comes out the other end!</p>
<p>I am a first-time dad of a now 16-month-old, so that means we&#8217;re starting to approach potty training. As we all know, the &#8220;natural, paleo way&#8221; of pooping is getting into that deep squat and letting fly. It&#8217;s so obvious to me that this is the way we&#8217;re meant to poop. I see it every morning: my little girl suddenly stops playing with her toys and drops into that ass-to-grass squat that my jiujitsu hips will never do again. By the time that thousand-yard stare creeps into her eyes, I&#8217;ve already got one hand on my SLS-free baby wipes.</p>
<p>Every parent has seen that, and yet every parent in this hemisphere insists on trying to get their kid going from this squat position to sitting on a porcelain platform with his/her feet dangling. The toddler naturally resists with a, &#8220;what the hell do you expect me to do from here?&#8221; look. Frustration ensues, but poop doesn&#8217;t. It seems like transitioning our toddlers from diapers to seated toilets is yet another mismatch of nature in our modern civilization.</p>
<p>For adults, it&#8217;s easy to make a homemade platform or buy a Squatty Potty / similar product. But what&#8217;s the plan for tots? I&#8217;ve considered setting up a kitty litter box in the bathroom. The mother-in-law is almost certainly going to lose her shit (heh heh) but maybe that&#8217;s the price of being the world&#8217;s #2 Dad!</p>
<p>Would love to hear your Paleo Poop Solution for how we are Wired to Shit.</p>

<p><b> 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/3KUuFNYiGT4">Travel Eating Tips? </a></b>[14:30]</p>
<p>Luiza says:</p>
<p>Got your masterclass and it was paramount for the achievement of the keto sunset. 8 weeks in, 15 lbs down and I feel amazing!</p>
<p>However I am quite a foodie and will be heading to Paris for 10 days in June to vacation with my brother and dad. I will be staying at a hotel and definitely don’t wanna miss out on real French croissants or pastries&#8230; I also am from Brazil and while I can tell the benefits of keto long term, I would not be able to go visit and skip out of eating fruits, which is most of my diet while I’m down there.</p>
<p>so question: Should I still try my best to keep up with calories/macro count while traveling and/or supplement with exogenous ketones (do they even work?) or should I not worry about it until I get back home? Am I gonna feel absolutely awful while getting back on carbs? On that note, maybe I should re-introduce carbs before I even go?</p>
<p>Appreciate your guidance on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/cmZWV4mctn8">BJJ + Recurring Staph Infections </a></b>[18:39]</p>
<p>Sam says:</p>
<p>Dear Robb + Nicki,</p>
<p>Over the last 12 year period, I&#8217;ve made numerous attempts to train BJJ–each attempt ending in a staph infection. My first time was about 12 years ago, where I got a good year of training in. This was punctuated by a pretty bad staph infection that flared back up a few more times shortly after. 8 years later, I went for it again&#8230;this time getting a staph infection after one week of training. Most recently, I got 6 months in before getting another. As you can imagine, every doctor I&#8217;ve ever talked to thinks I just need more antibiotics, or that I have some secret colony of staph living in my nose. This approach has obviously not been successful for me. It also fails to address why I only get them while training, and never in the periods in between. While hygiene may have been to blame the first time, I was pretty careful the last two times, even if it wasn&#8217;t 100% perfect. I had a funky sleep schedule before my most recent occurrence, which I think may have contributed. Some more details for you&#8230;I&#8217;m 33, in good shape, otherwise healthy, eat well, and sleep well. I&#8217;ve always lifted weights outside of BJJ but nothing crazy in terms of volume. My question for you is: If this was happening to you, where would you start? What would you be looking at? I have considered seeing a functional medicine practitioner as I&#8217;ve wondered if there are some bigger picture immune issues at play. I appreciate any thoughts you have on this– I don&#8217;t want my BJJ career to be over so soon. Thanks!</p>

<p><b> 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/IpW_1XcKfgs">Adult Autism &#8211; Should I Go Keto? </a></b>[23:51]</p>
<p>Alex says:</p>
<p>Hi Nicki and Robb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 29 and was diagnosed as on the autism spectrum just two years ago. This would have been considered as asperger&#8217;s in the past. I&#8217;ve been primarily paleo (ice cream is really good) for the better part of six years, but after running my DNA through Found My Fitness, I&#8217;m wanting to address my dietary choices from a more personalized approach, including finding the most optimal choices to address some of the occasional stressors I feel associated with being on the spectrum &#8211; anxiety, depression, and general cognitive/mood disregulation.</p>
<p>The most researched dietary intervention seems to be a gluten free, dairy free diet, with a few studies looking into keto. However, each study I&#8217;ve seen is only looking at kids as the subjects and typically with more severe symptoms than what I experience. Keto seems to be a promising approach, but is there any reason why this would be different for an adult? I tried keto for about a month a year ago but immediately found my cognitive performance drop. While I know my macro amounts were appropriate (used ketogains calculator), I know now that I didn&#8217;t incorporate the electrolyte component. Could this account for my initial struggles with it? Is there anything else someone on the spectrum should consider when attempting keto? Supplements, macro ratios, etc.? I&#8217;ll include more details about me below, but thank you for your time in reading question and all of your work.</p>

<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Hey, Hubs</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Welcome back, wife. What&#8217;s new? What&#8217;s exciting? We&#8217;re living in the Arctic of Reno</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I know. It&#8217;s been a really, really long, drawn-out spring going into summer. It&#8217;s cold.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> The White King is dead. Winter should be ending, but it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Winter is still here.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yup. Did you want to fill people in on anything, or do you just want to jump in?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> If you want, sure, what we&#8217;re thinking of doing.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Sure. Well, no, you do it.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Well, we have decided that we are going to be moving to Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> You gonna be oblique about where so nobody can find us? We had a crazy story. Zoe was only a couple of days old&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I don&#8217;t know what crazy story you&#8217;re telling.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;that, when the people showed up at our front door?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Oh. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. So, a little bit of background, and I&#8217;m sorry, if you don&#8217;t give two shits about this, just fast forward a little. A really close friend of ours had just had this super gnarly identity theft thing go on where somebody found out that they were out of town, they forwarded their mail&#8230; It was super, super messed up-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;and so we were kind of a little on edge from that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So, that was one week before, and then we had Zoe. She was super young. I was, like, nursing in the back room.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> This was day four or five and we were completely sleep deprived, like, out of your head and you&#8217;re legitimately insane at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Uh-huh (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And, somebody had pinged Squatchy, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, I want to send Robb one of these exercise mobility ball things or something like that, and so Squatchy had given them our home address, and, lo and behold, somebody knocks on the door-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> and I show up at the door just disheveled and exhausted, and there are these people I&#8217;ve never met before with this little rubber ball. They&#8217;re like-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, we had a wedding to go to and so we were driving through, so we thought we would just personally deliver it.&#8221; (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Robb: </strong>And so, after that, we got a P.O. box. And, it&#8217;s not that we hide our location, but I&#8217;ve had a few, kind of wacky threats from the crazy vegans and stuff like that. We have kids and so, yeah. So, we&#8217;ll be&#8230; it&#8217;s central Texas. Yeah, we&#8217;re looking at central Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Hill country Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Hill country Texas.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> But, not Austin.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But, not Austin. Yeah. All the cool kids can go there. We&#8217;re going somewhere else. So, anyway, yeah, we&#8217;re looking at moving so the podcast may be a little hit and miss. We&#8217;re trying to bank some of these-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, but-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;so that we stay on top of that but, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah. So.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That&#8217;s our preamble on that, or our pre-ramble.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Pre-ramble. All right. We&#8217;ll jump in then.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So our first question is on enzymes and IBS from Ken, and he says, &#8220;Robb, talk to us about enzymes. I&#8217;ve played with a lot of different things over the years to help with IBS issues and, for a long time, I was devoted to probiotics, but I never found any real, consistent results with them. I took a stool test a year or so ago and discovered that literally none of the strains of probiotics I had so diligently taken and paid for were significantly present. Along the way, anti-fungals and anti-parasitic medication, doctor-prescribed, helped calm the fire down below, but it was enzymes that seemed to have made the final difference for me.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Not only is the fire largely out, I&#8217;ve really not had to keep up with taking enzymes like I did with probiotics. To be fair to probiotics, they seem to help in the moment, but I get the sense you have to take them daily, which does not seem to be the case with enzymes. I should mention I know several people that have had the same experience with probiotics and enzymes, and my question is, what is the mechanism at work? I get that enzymes help break down foods, but why would that help with IBS symptoms and, furthermore, why would those symptoms be largely gone after only six months or so of using them, but not taking them even daily?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting stuff. When I was at the UCSF conference that Akil Palanisamy puts on each year, really amazing event. Doctor Datis Kharrazian was there, and this guy is so smart. Chiro and also a Ph.D in Immunology, I think, from Harvard, so kind of&#8230; D.C., Ph.D guy, and he&#8217;s a real, legit gut health expert, and really on the&#8230; how do you fix things clinically. And, he did an amazing breakdown of this whole story, and he relies heavily on things like betaine hydrochloride, apple cider vinegar, which I have shifted to using capsules because, when I would do the apple cider vinegar shots, it was dissolving my teeth, which it has a tendency to do, and butyrate.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, what&#8217;s going on on that in kind of a multi-factorial story is that the enzymes in improving the acid content of the stomach while you&#8217;re eating food&#8230; if you break everything down into its constituent parts, and we&#8217;re really concerned about the proteins in this story, and proteins, whether it&#8217;s from animal sources or plant sources, if they hit the gut lining as single amino acids or dipeptides, which is about the ideal scenario, there&#8217;s really not immunogenic substance, then. There&#8217;s not the problematic proteins that can irritate the gut and cause the motility issues that kind of typify IBS. And then, he recommended the butyrate because the butyrate tends to help fix the gap junction issues within the gut in kind of a primary indirect fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, when a healthy gut, assuming that an individual is eating some fermented, fermentable fiber and all that type of stuff, would get butyrate and propionate and malonate and these different short-chain fats, that improve gap junction function, and then, in theory, a healthy gut, people are robustly digesting all of their food, including the proteins, and also the carbohydrates that should be digested early in the process versus, you know, if we have poor digestion, those carbohydrates can make their way intact into later portions of the digestion, which is kind of where SIBO and all that stuff pops up.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, that&#8217;s kind of the mechanism there, and it makes a lot of sense, and what&#8217;s interesting about that, it&#8217;s a little bit reminiscent&#8230; the gut health topic and the microbiome topic is really interesting, and I think when we&#8217;ve talked about this a couple of times before, but clearly the gut microbiome and gut health is critical. But, we don&#8217;t really know yet, I think in general, what to do about it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> About fifty percent&#8230; Most of the studies you look at, Doctor Ruscio has talked about this&#8230; a hundred people take a probiotic formula, about half of the people show improvements, half the people don&#8217;t. Some of the don&#8217;ts actually get worse. So, it&#8217;s very hit and miss in that regard, and also the probiotics generally are not intended to be repopulating the gut. They&#8217;re actually intended to kind of tune the immune system, although some work from the Sonnenberg Lab suggests that the process of putting these gut microbes from probiotics through this system actually creates a more amenable environment for you to get other organisms from the environment that should be taking up residence there, and&#8230; really interesting stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But, the point being that&#8230; if we look at people who have had different forms of ileostomies, like, basically having their intestines, to varying degrees removed, these people don&#8217;t live shorter, worser lives than people with all of that real estate. And this is despite whatever injury or illness caused that scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, on the one had, clearly the gut microbiome and gut health is really important, but it seems, in my mind&#8230; my kind of take on this, is it&#8217;s really, really important to either function well or, if pathology has occurred, then we need to somehow address the pathology, because, clearly, just removing that real estate, it makes all the notion of, well, fiber is critical to health and all this stuff. It really kind of casts an interesting light on it, so, in the scenario of really augmenting frontal digestion with enzymes and potentially, again, apple cider vinegar or some other acid sources, that would appear to really fix a lot of problems because we&#8217;re breaking the food down and there isn&#8217;t the large proteins that are potentially immunogenically stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on both on the probiotics side and, most likely, on the enzyme side. It is intriguing to me that you can get by with this with intermittent use instead of needing to be really consistent. But also, even though the IBS had gone on apparently for some significant period of time, he maybe only needs to kind of pulse that whole process. Because it is interesting, too, once the gut heals, then cholecystokinin release is more normalized, and acid secretions are more normalized. We know that H. pylori suppresses acid production, ironically, even though it&#8217;s associated with peptic ulcers, but it tends to suppress acid production in the stomach to foster a more amenable environment for the H. pylori. So, sometimes if we move out the&#8230; if we change the gut microbiome in a favorable way, then it just actually gets a little bit of a feed forward mechanism going and it just generally functions better. So, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right. Our next question is from Terrence on squat pooping and toilet training. Terrence says, &#8220;Hey Robb and Nicki, loving the new Q and A format. You&#8217;ve done such a great job educating the public on what to put in one end of their bodies that I want to take a moment to talk about how to get the most out of what comes out the other end.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I&#8217;m a first-time dad of a now-sixteen-month-old, so that means we&#8217;re starting to approach potty training. As we all know, the natural Paleo way of pooping is getting into that deep squat and letting fly. So obvious to me that this is the way we&#8217;re meant to poop. I see it every morning: my little girl suddenly stops playing with her toys and drops into that ass-to-grass squat that my jiu jitsu hips will never do again. By the time that thousand-yard stare creeps into her eyes, I&#8217;ve already got one hand on my SLS-free baby wipes. (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Every parent has seen that and yet every parent in this hemisphere insists on trying to get their kid going from this squat position to sitting on a porcelain platform with his or her feet dangling. The toddler naturally resists with a, &#8216;What the hell do you expect me to do from here?&#8217; look, and frustration ensues, but poop doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Seems like transitioning your toddlers from diapers to seated toilets is yet another mismatch of nature in our modern civilization. For adults, it&#8217;s easy to make a homemade platform, or buy a Squatty Potty, or similar product, but what&#8217;s the plan for tots? I&#8217;ve considered setting up a kitty litter box in the bathroom. (laughs) Mother-in-law is almost certainly going to lose her shit, (laughs) but maybe that&#8217;s the price of being the World&#8217;s Number Two Dad.&#8221; (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Terrence, that&#8217;s hilarious. &#8220;Would love to hear your Paleo poop solution for how we are wired to shit.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Terrence definitely gets Best Question of the Podcast History Award.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> He gets&#8230; yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I don&#8217;t know, I mean&#8230; the first thought that pops in my mind is, &#8220;This is a great product opportunity for Terrence to get in and try to address.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You know what&#8217;s interesting is other countries have&#8230; you do squat.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I remember traveling to Turkey when I was nineteen, and even Italy, I think, they have some toilets like this, where it&#8217;s a hole in the ground, it&#8217;s porcelain, then there&#8217;s a little spot for your feet, but you actually squat. And, it flushes, but you&#8217;re not sitting on anything.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I&#8217;m sure you can order these toilets and have them installed in your home. [laughs]</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right. Can we do that with our new house?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> We can look into it.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Look into that. Yeah, I mean, we saw this same phenomena go down, and there is pretty clear literature suggesting that pooping not in a squat&#8230; you get a little bit of, like, fecal backflow because we&#8217;re supposed to have a valsalva maneuver, and&#8230; so, yeah, this is another one of the things that&#8230; you know, it&#8217;s so interesting, some of the articles on this, is, suggests that a lot of what we characterize as kind of normal GI dysfunction is a consequence of the way that we&#8217;re pooping, but that&#8217;s just so endemic that it&#8217;s kind of a problem hidden in plain sight. The researchers generally never even ask the question, &#8220;Well, if I change my position and was in a more, you know, I guess it&#8217;s not orthopedically, like, poop-opedically aligned position that, you know, this stuff would be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But, yeah, I&#8217;ve wanted the pit toilet for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s just a square, porcelain thing-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And it still flushes and does all that stuff, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8230;that sits in the ground with a hole, just like a normal toilet bowl hole, with little grooves for your shoes, and you just squat, and it has a flush.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Well, let&#8217;s look into that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> (laughs) Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> (laughs) Terrence, we&#8217;ll keep you posted if we find one of those in the new digs, we&#8217;ll send you info on it. But, really good question, and it&#8217;s interesting, and this is another one of these things that we get our kids started off not on the right foot with a lot of stuff. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is from Luiza on falling off the wagon. She says, &#8220;I got your masterclass and it was paramount for the achievement of the keto sunset. Eight weeks in, fifteen pounds down, and I feel amazing. However, I&#8217;m quite a foodie, and will be heading to Paris for ten days in June to vacation with my brother and dad. I will be staying at a hotel and definitely don&#8217;t want to miss out on real French croissants or pastries. I also am from Brazil, and while I can tell the benefits of keto long-term, I would not be able to go visit and skip out on eating fruit, which is most of my diet while I&#8217;m down there.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So, my question: should I still try my best to keep up with the calories and macro count while traveling, and/or supplement with exogenous ketones? Do they even work? Or, should I not worry about it until I get back home? And, am I going to feel absolutely awful while getting back on carbs? On that note, maybe I should reintroduce carbs before I go. I appreciate your guidance on the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, maybe we&#8217;ll start from the back and then work forward. Are you going to feel awful going back on carbs? I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Depends on-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;it just depends, person-to-person. I don&#8217;t know, I go back and forth on this. On the one hand, I guess a really minimal tweak to what you&#8217;re doing and still being able to enjoy all that you have to experience there, try to make sure you hit your protein minimum. That just seems to be so important for not overeating, whether we&#8217;re on a low-carb or a low-fat diet. So, by hook or by crook, just make sure that you get your protein in. If you&#8217;re in Brazil, then eat all the fruit, but make sure that you&#8217;re getting plenty of protein with the fruit. When you&#8217;re eating your croissant, make sure that you don&#8217;t forgo the eggs and-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Sausage and whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;sausage and all that type of stuff. And, a little bit of portion control&#8230; I mean, the challenge, or the benefit, of keto is that we&#8217;re removing the carb-fat combo, and that&#8217;s where it becomes challenging for people to maintain normal appetite control. Again, adequate protein is really going to help with that, but&#8230; So-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So, in Brazil, should she do protein and fruit, and skip any additional fat?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And in Paris, she could do protein and don&#8217;t put butter on her French croissants and pastries.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Maybe a little bit, but yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, try to-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Just don&#8217;t go crazy on it. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8230;I think there&#8217;s a lot of butter in them already-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Right.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8230;when they make them, but trying to minimize the fat if she&#8217;s going to increase her carbs.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, yeah, to some degree. And, as to the exogenous ketones, exogenous ketones are great, but the point isn&#8217;t necessarily to take a ketone supplement to paper over other dietary concerns, unless we&#8217;re really tackling that from a neurodegenerative perspective, or something like that. So, I mean, I don&#8217;t really see the exogenous ketones being a huge boon in this scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> If you like them, some people do notice that they do get some appetite regulation by dropping in a scoop of the exogenous ketones or the MCTs. There&#8217;s one study that suggests a carb-rich breakfast plus MCTs caused people to then&#8230; and also, I&#8217;ve got to say they ate adequate protein in this, too, so it wasn&#8217;t just carbs and MCT. It was a good whack of protein, some standard carb intake, but then adding MCT in, what they noticed over time, was that these folks tended to eat fewer calories overall throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Hm.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And Chris Masterjohn did a nice unpacking of this, and so&#8230; That might work that similarly with the exogenous ketones. We don&#8217;t have a study on that yet. There is one reasonably well-performed study that suggests that MCT powder or MCT oil does that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Well, have fun, Luiza. That sounds like a really fun summer.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I wouldn&#8217;t mind that. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is from Sam on BJJ and recurring staph infections.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;Dear Robb and Nicki, over the last twelve-year period, I&#8217;ve made numerous attempts to train BJJ, each attempt ending in a staph infection. My first time was about twelve years ago, where I got a good year of training in, which was punctuated by a pretty bad staph infection that flared back up a few more times shortly after. Eight years later, I went for it again, this time getting a staph infection after one week of training. Most recently, I got six months in before getting another. As you can imagine, every doctor I have talked to thinks I just need more antibiotics, or that I have some secret colony of staph living in my nose.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> This approach has obviously not been successful for me. It also fails to address why I only get them while training and never in the periods in between. While hygiene may have been to blame the first time, I was pretty careful the last two times, even if I wasn&#8217;t 100% perfect. I had a funky sleep schedule before my most recent occurrence, which I think may have contributed.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Some more details for you: I&#8217;m 33, in good shape, otherwise healthy, eat well, sleep well. I&#8217;ve always lifted weights outside of BJJ, but nothing crazy in terms of volume. My question for you is, if this was happening to you, where would you start? What would you be looking at? I&#8217;ve considered seeing a functional medicine practitioner, as I&#8217;ve wondered if there are some bigger picture immune issues at play, and I appreciate any thoughts you have on this. I don&#8217;t want my BJJ career to be over so soon.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah. Gosh, where would we jump into this? Getting a functional medicine assessment wouldn&#8217;t be the worst thing in the world, to see if there is something kind of off with HPTA axis, cortisol, which could be suppressing immune function&#8230; Definitely the hygiene of the gym that you&#8217;re in is a big factor. The places that we&#8217;ve gone to, they&#8217;re pretty on it. They spray the mats down in between classes, and they&#8217;re definitely on top of that. So, that maintenance is important. What is the name of the soap that Darien sells?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Oh&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> There&#8217;s, like, a-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> It&#8217;s Defense? Defense? Maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, Defense Soap. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I&#8217;ll find it for sure and we can put a link in the show notes.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, but I think it has tea tree oil and some other antimicrobials, and a lot of people swear by that. This is also why, even though my jiu jitsu game, I&#8217;m not fabric-dependent, I&#8217;m not hanging onto the gi. I tend to wear a rash guard, and then a gi. I don&#8217;t usually wear sprats also, but you could do that. But, taking all that stuff, then you just have minimal surface area exposed.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, yeah, I mean, the boxes to tick, see if there&#8217;s anything that could be obvious with regards to immune function and something being amiss there. Definitely lean on the facility owners to clean the mats thoroughly. I would recommend wearing a rash guard, possibly sprats and a gi-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki</strong>: Wash the gi every single-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;and launder those aggressively each time.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8230;yeah, every single time. If you get off the mat to go to the bathroom, put shoes on and walk.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Everybody in the gym should be wearing shoes into the bathroom, on and off the mat.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, they should be bringing sandals to go in. It&#8217;s so gross when you see people sprint to the bathroom. The guy&#8217;s always in&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Barefoot.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;barefoot, and then they come back on, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Listen, knucklehead&#8230;&#8221; But, those are the things. Anything else? Yeah, laundering the, your&#8230; whatever you wear thoroughly, and then the Defense Soap, maybe, post-training would be the things that I would look at.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Can the sleep thing&#8230; I mean, if you&#8217;re super sleep-deprived and stuff-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Definitely, I mean, sleep-deprived. And, one other thought with this is, if you&#8217;re going really hard rolling, it&#8217;s like a CrossFit workout or something. People can turn these sessions into a near-death experience, which can kind of crush your immune response. And so, you may need to look at the intensity that you&#8217;re training, and it&#8217;s hard for people to do.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> In the beginning, they just are battling for survival, and the only thing that you can rely on is strength and cardio and power output and everything, but that will knacker you, and it definitely impacts immune response. Yeah, it can kind of dig a hole. So, I would definitely consider, you know, how hard are you going and figure out ways of dialing that back. I would check out Henry Aiken&#8217;s Hidden Jiu Jitsu course. He has a specific module in his course when he had a gig in Bali, and he actually has a block of, like, fifteen videos that shows him rolling with the people that attended the event, and Henry just, he looks like he&#8217;s almost unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Now, granted, he&#8217;s got twenty-plus years of jiu jitsu experience, but even though I&#8217;m nowhere near where Henry is, my rolling looks way more like that than what you see in the competition videos, where people are super rigid and they&#8217;re just go-go-go&#8230; and, so, and that&#8217;s part of the reason why I&#8217;ve been able to train pretty consistently, and I try to figure out how my forty to sixty percent effort can continue to beat or make improvements on everybody else&#8217;s ninety-five percent effort. So, that would be another piece to look at.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see, our last question today is from Alex, an adult on the autism spectrum: should I go keto?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8220;Hi, Nicki and Robb. I&#8217;m twenty-nine and I was diagnosed as on the autism spectrum just two years ago. This would have been considered as Asperger&#8217;s in the past. I&#8217;ve been primarily Paleo, ice cream is really good-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> &#8230;for the better part of six years, but after running my DNA through FoundMyFitness, I&#8217;m wanting to address my dietary choices from a more personalized approach, including finding the most optimal choices to address some of the occasional stressors I feel associated with being on the Spectrum: anxiety, depression, and general cognitive and mood dysregulation.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> The most researched dietary intervention seems to be a gluten-free, dairy-free diet with a few studies looking into keto. However, each study I&#8217;ve seen is only looking at kids as the subjects, and typically with more severe symptoms than what I experience. Keto seems to be a promising approach, but is there any reason why this would be different for an adult?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I tried keto for about a month a year ago, but immediately found my cognitive performance drop. While I know my macro amounts were appropriate, I used the Ketogains Calculator, I now know that I didn&#8217;t incorporate the electrolyte component. Could this account for my initial struggles with it, and is there anything else someone on the Spectrum should consider while attempting keto? Supplements, macro ratios, et cetera. I&#8217;ll include more details about me below, but thank you for your time in reading the question, and all of your work.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And, details: age, height, weight, CrossFit-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative), sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;decent sleep, and then he mentions some of his polymorphisms from the FoundMyFitness stuff. It&#8217;s interesting, there shouldn&#8217;t&#8230; if one is going to benefit from keto for a neurological situation. I don&#8217;t see that there would be any difference between kids and adults. It is, that said, it is interesting many children who go on a ketogenic diet for, say, epilepsy, they don&#8217;t need to stay on it for life. They&#8217;re able to get off of it at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, there is something that changes there. So, I don&#8217;t know if the flip side could apply, that maybe there was a window in childhood where this could have worked and now it&#8217;s not going to. That doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me, but it&#8230; yeah, I don&#8217;t know. But, definitely not everybody experiences cognitive improvement on a ketogenic diet. But, the lack of adequate electrolytes, in particular, sodium, is just jaw-dropping, make-or-break deal. So, if you were going to get back in and try this again, I would definitely check out LMNT, get, go&#8230; even if you just go to the drinkLMNT.com page, and then check out the How to Make Your Own Keto At Home Electrolyte Drink. One or the other, do that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Start supplementing, if you do Kettle &amp; Fire Bone Broth, put some salt in that, significant amount.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> You really have to be on point with all that. You could also try using a little bit of MCTs or exogenous ketones in this scenario, because if we really are talking about a brain metabolism story, potentially some gut dysbiosis, those things may help in this whole process.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Additionally, on the supplements, a really rich form of DHA, EPA, DHA, but leaning heaving on the DHA, if you just eat a lot of fish. I&#8217;m wearing Wild Planet, these guys are amazing, getting fish from these guys or something similar. Sardines, mackerel, salmon-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;would be really beneficial, or you could supplement with a DHA-rich fish oil or krill oil formula.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Thanks, Alex. Hubs, that was our five questions for this week.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Cool, cool. Somebody commented that they felt like we were rushed going through these, which I don&#8217;t know-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Oh, I didn&#8217;t see that comment.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;that we&#8217;re rushed, but, yeah, it was a private message, compared to the Greg Everett days-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;where we would just wax on and on and on.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> You had no kids and no&#8230; (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We had no kids and, also&#8230; I try to be as thorough as I can, but also concise because people have a shortened attention span these days-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;and so, try not to wax on too long, but trying to strike a balance between being both thorough and concise.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So, there you have it.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We&#8217;ll talk to y&#8217;all soon. Oh, thanks for the-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no. If you have questions, you can submit them, robbwolf.com contact page. What else?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Drink LMNT sponsored this podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yep. Sponsored this LMNT</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Drink Element, and even though we&#8217;re not-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Coming into a summer, too, so, if you&#8217;re in a hot climate in particular, you&#8217;re going to want to be supplementing with electrolytes. If you&#8217;re active, and you were saying something-</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And, love the Wild Planet guys. So, they&#8217;re a podcast sponsor this week, too. (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> They&#8217;re really amazing people. They&#8230; So, the back of this shirt says something like, &#8220;When you&#8230; would your tuna&#8230; How was your tuna caught? One line, one fish, one process.&#8221; They really are committed to sustainable fishing practices-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;and they&#8217;ve been beating this drum for a long time, so big shout out to the Wild Plant people. They&#8217;re wonderful folks doing some very cool work. In addition to the fish, they&#8217;re also doing some meat and chicken options-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Oh, I didn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> &#8230;in like the vacu-seal packs and stuff like that, but they&#8217;re, like, organic and blessed by the Dalai Lama and all that stuff. But, really cool people, so, check out both of our sponsors, DrinkLMNT and also Wild Planet.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Thanks, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Take care. Buh-bye</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ketogenic diet is an effective, natural way to burn fat and achieve healthy body weight. </span><span class="s1">This way of eating (best summarized as a low carbohydrate, high healthful fat, and moderate protein nutritional approach) has even proven to prevent and manage of a variety of chronic diseases. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, oftentimes when people start looking into going keto, they can be dissuaded by the “keto flu”—a particularly ominous sounding side effect of the diet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The keto flu is a constellation of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, and muscle cramps, which are a direct result of reducing carbohydrates and transitioning your body’s primary fuel source from glucose to ketones. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Want to learn more about keto flu? </span><a href="https://robbwolf.com/2019/06/05/the-keto-flu-symptoms-remedies-and-how-to-avoid-it/"><span class="s1">Go here to read my full article on the keto flu—including symptoms, remedies, and how to avoid it</span></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most painful manifestations of the keto flu is muscle cramps, which can hit out of nowhere and even wake you up from a deep sleep. Some people push through only for the keto flu to make the first three to five days of the transition SO challenging that they throw their hands in the air and quit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though leg cramps are a <em>perfectly normal</em> reaction for a body transitioning into ketosis, there are a number of steps you can take to prevent their onset or, at a minimum, mitigate their severity. </span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Electrolytes: The Missing Link</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a number of chemical structures in the human body that are classified as electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, and phosphate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electrolytes play a vital role in human physiology, as they conduct electricity from one point in the body to another. This conveyance of electricity allows muscles to contract, synapses to fire, and damaged tissue to regenerate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Electrolytes are so important that their imbalance can lead to death: hyponatremia describes the condition in which sodium is significantly decreased in the body, and can ultimately lead to heart attacks, while potassium can actually be used to stop the human heart, as is the <i>modus operandi </i>for executions by lethal injection.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While all electrolytes play their own important role in the body’s functioning, the three we are primarily concerned with today are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1">Sodium</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Potassium</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Magnesium </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="s1">These three electrolytes need to be consumed in a specific ratio to one another to ensure you maintain electrolyte balance. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">Every day, in addition to what you take in from dietary sources, you should be consuming 5,000mg of sodium; 1,000mg of potassium, ideally in the form of potassium chloride or potassium sulfate; and 300mg of magnesium.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Drinking Water is Not Going to Help You!</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s one thing that always shocks people when I discuss the topic of leg cramps and the ketogenic diet: <i>drinking water is not enough to kick the keto flu</i>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, overconsumption of water can actually exacerbate electrolyte imbalance even further. The only truly effective way to control leg cramps on the ketogenic diet is to properly supplement lost electrolytes as you transition into ketosis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Short of emergency situations, virtually no one dies from a lack of hydration. However, hyponatremia, the condition in which your body is so depleted of sodium that it can’t function, is a major killer, and one driver of sodium depletion is overhydration with water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea that water will help relieve muscle cramps is a long-standing misconception; most people have no idea that water can often times make cramping worse! </span><span class="s1">A 2019 study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899546?fbclid=IwAR14vIO7Za8yDTJD67QSSSIcxo5-aZ8EneVeRWEeG_zN2dD3W3mA0YPWKmU"><span class="s2">published</span></a> in the journal <i>BMJ Open Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine </i>found that water consumption following intense exercise actually <i>increased</i> the muscles’ susceptibility to cramping, whereas an electrolyte replacement mixture decreased it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is thought that water on its own actually exacerbate the exercise-induced electrolyte imbalance by further diluting what few electrolytes are left. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">How Can You Prevent Leg Cramps on Keto?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As mentioned above, water alone will not relieve keto leg cramps because it only further exacerbates the electrolyte imbalance caused by the ketogenic diet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get relief from keto leg cramps, get your electrolytes on point! Specifically, this means ensuring you get adequate levels of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. To that end, here are some simple ways to increase your intake of electrolytes on the ketogenic diet and fight off leg cramps:</span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">1. Salt Your Food</span><span class="s3"><b><br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most foods on the ketogenic diet do not contain naturally-occurring sodium at adequate levels, so it is critically important for you to salt your food. Even if it is gustatorily challenging to salt a salad, I’d really encourage you to try it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Ironically, many people are able to hit our recommended levels of sodium intake and avoid cramping because the processed foods we typically consume contain so much sodium. Transitioning away from these processed and preserved foods towards whole foods is absolutely the right move, but we have to keep in mind that this will reduce the amount of sodium we get through our diet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So salt it! Any kind of salt will do&#8230;I don&#8217;t recommend one kind of salt (Himalayan pink, Hawaiian black, etc.) over the other. However, if you have a personal preference for one type of salt, that’s no problem! Just make sure you’re getting adequate salt into your diet to replace that which you’re no longer consuming through processed foods. </span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">2. Consume Bone Broth</span><span class="s3"><b><br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve probably heard about the scientific research surrounding bone broth before and are familiar with its status as a nutrient-packed superfood; it is commonly promoted based on its benefits for the gut, joints, skin, and overall health. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bone broth is made by simmering the bones and connective tissues of an animal for ten to twenty hours, which is what separates it from the standard broth or stock found in most grocery stores which is only simmered for a few hours tops. Cooking this concoction for such a long time allows the liquid to absorb all of the collagen, glutamine, and other minerals that give bone broth its nutrient density. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While bone broth is a decent source of sodium on its own, it’s very easy to add some salt, a bouillon cube, or Raw Unflavored LMNT to really turn it into a keto cramp-ending treat.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">3. Mix Up Electrolyte Homebrews</span><span class="s3"><b><br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing that I stress all the time is that you should </span><span class="s4">never</span><span class="s1"> retreat to the sugary sports drinks of your youth to combat keto leg cramps. All of the mainstream “electrolyte-replacement” products on the market offer wholly insufficient levels of the electrolytes and are very high in sugar. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The overload of electrolyte-less sugar you consume with these beverages will only spike insulin levels and impede your ability to transition into ketogenesis. Despite the worldwide catchy marketing campaigns and sponsorships of virtually every visible sporting event, these drinks should be avoided&#8211;honestly, whether you adhere to a ketogenic diet or not.</span></p>
<h4><span class="s1">4. Stay Salty with LMNT Recharge</span><span class="s3"><b><br />
</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dearth of quality electrolyte replacement beverages on the market drove me to spend countless hours mixing up homemade concoctions with ingredients from my own pantry. After a ton of trial and error, I was able to nail down a few <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0052/6434/3074/files/9_Simple_Electrolyte_Homebrew_Recipes_-_Elemental_Labs.pdf"><span class="s2">great do-it-yourself drink recipes</span></a> for anyone who is inclined to mix up their own cramp-killing concoctions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’d like to dive into some of my favorites, you can see a list of my best recipes <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0052/6434/3074/files/9_Simple_Electrolyte_Homebrew_Recipes_-_Elemental_Labs.pdf"><span class="s2">here</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Additionally, after years of tinkering with these homebrew recipes—some of which were way off the mark—and waiting for someone to come up with a product that wasn’t full of sugar, I decided to take the matter into my own hands&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve worked hard to develop LMNT Recharge, a new product that is precisely formulated to replenish the electrolytes your body will purge in the adoption phase of the ketogenic diet. If I can so say myself, it’s quite a tasty powdered mix full of everything you need&#8211;sodium, potassium, and magnesium&#8211;and nothing you don&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><a href="https://www.drinklmnt.com/ingredients?utm_source=RobbWolf&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=LMNTCONTENT">You can learn more about the ingredients here.</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I often hear people who have tried and abandoned the ketogenic diet say that the keto flu—specifically the leg cramps—is what drove them away from the diet. It’s an easy process to understand: you start a diet and instantly feel awful instead of feeling energized and wonderful and quickly thereafter decide that the diet just isn’t for you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is my hope that a better understanding of the keto flu will help new adherents stick out the initial adoption phase—armed with all the electrolytes their body needs to push back the keto flu—and reap its long-term benefits. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our bodies have everything they need to fuel themselves with ketones, but years of carbohydrate addiction has allowed them to “forget” how to burn fat for fuel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All our bodies need is a little bit of time to relearn this natural process, and knowing how to handle the keto flu enables you to give your body the time to adjust without succumbing to cramps, brain fog, and exhaustion.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/MdsVWCMUflg">ATP Supplements? </a></b>[1:35]</p>
<p>Gordon says:</p>
<p>Do you deal with or see anybody taking the new ATP supplements ( Peak ATP)? &nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen them as a pre workout supplement and also for use with chronic fatigue patients ( they also use NADH as ATP precursor ) &nbsp;Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2.<a href="https://youtu.be/gMMI0YpmB5k"> Multivitamin: Powder Or Pill? </a></b>[4:16]</p>
<p>Michael says:</p>
<p>If a person chooses to have a multivitamin, is it better in pill form, or powder (drink with water)?</p>
<p>I ask because fat Soluble vitamins are absorbed in the presence of fat. It would seem drinking a powder in, for example, a litre of water over several hours might mean that the vitamins may not be absorbed as well (no fatty meals in between to help absorb said vitamins)</p>
<p>Where a pill could be taken with a meal or with a little fat?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIpeltBmEHs">Individualizing Your Diet </a></b>[10:09]</p>
<p>Nathan says:</p>
<p>I have watched the change in dietary recommendations over the years and have tried Paleo, Keto and higher carb diets. I have seen really good results on low carb diets but they seem hard to sustain due to high activity at work.</p>
<p>I have also heard Robb say he has had good results eating beans/legumes. I am considering trying to eat a diet that focuses on whole foods rather than macros.</p>
<p>My question related to this is, &#8220;Have you found that the quality of food is more important than the macronutrients for overall health?&#8221; Not that macros aren&#8217;t important but you can manipulate the macros to a Keto style diet with low quality food but it seems that would be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Andrew says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb,</p>
<p>I have a question on a point you made in the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">Keto Masterclass</a>, Module 4.</p>
<p>You said that collagen (specifically collagen protein powders) are great supplements and can have many benefits, but that the protein content should not count towards your daily protein intake. I have been making and eating a collagen concoction (Great Lakes Collagen Hydrolysate) for years as a meal (2nd) in between lunch (1st) and dinner (3rd) that I have been counting as a third of my protein intake.</p>
<p>I understand that collagen protein is not the same as animal protein, but can you expand on this a bit. I remember reading something along the lines of it lacking completeness, not having optimal ratios of amino acids and having some that are unessential, but have I really been short-changing myself on protein and should I replace this with animal protein?</p>

<p><b>5. <a href="https://youtu.be/lmbwHapbUVo">Body Refuses Ketosis in High Stress Job </a></b>[23:16]</p>
<p>Jenika says:</p>
<p>Hello Robb, I have a question regarding the body naturally kicking itself out of ketosis in high stress work environments.</p>
<p>I have been a fat burner now for over a year and have been immensely successful. I have lost 15 pounds, gained muscle, rid myself of candida, my vision has improved, my alopecia hair loss has gone away. I feel like i am functioning the way I should. I also run faster, jump higher, and train better than I ever have in my life. I am 29 years old.</p>
<p>I work as a Stewardess on private luxury yachts. So I live and work onboard. With no guests onboard I maintain a healthy balanced routine. When we have guests onboard I am working 14-16 hour days on my feet running around and up and down stairs constantly. This can go from 1 week up to 5 weeks with no days off. I certainly don&#8217;t exercise during this time apart from light stretching and Nidra yoga.</p>
<p>It is a high stress environment both mentally and physically. It seems that my body just refuses to stay in ketosis despite my dietary efforts. I crave fruit, gain weight, gain water weight, and don&#8217;t feel satiated ever. &nbsp;I am assuming this is because my body goes into fight or flight mode.</p>
<p>My question is if there is anything I can do to trick the system into staying into ketosis? Or should I just give into the body&#8217;s desire for glucose and introduce fruit and perhaps sweet potato into the diet and lower my fat intake. I guess I don&#8217;t want to be pumping myself full of fat if my body doesn&#8217;t want to use it for fuel.</p>
<p>This is a constant occurrence in my job (given I haven&#8217;t worked full time in the last 8 months). I am potentially going into a busy mediterranean season and would like to maintain my physique and be gentle to my body considering the circumstances.</p>
<p>Any insight you might have would be hugely appreciated. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,</p>

<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Top of the morning wife.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So apparently we&#8217;ve entered our goth phase.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Because we&#8217;re wearing black?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We&#8217;re all in black, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I don&#8217;t think that means anything, other than we have a lot of black.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So it&#8217;s correlation, not causation, or something like that? We&#8217;re getting along great today, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Robb almost tripped and spilled my coffee all over me, it was a near ginormous disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Just catastrophic. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d call it ginormous, catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Burning your wife with hot coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> That&#8217;s catastrophic, not ginormous.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Shall we sashay from there.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Let&#8217;s jump right into our first question, this week, from Gordon on ATP. He says, do you deal with or see anybody taking the new ATP supplements, Peak ATP. I have seen them a pre workout supplement and also for use with chronic fatigue patients. They also use NADH as an ATP precursor, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, man there&#8217;s a lot of interesting stuff around this. So different metabolic issues that folks develop like the shifting of the NADH ratios is kind of indicative of kind of the cellular machinery, almost kind of like grinding down. Like they&#8217;re not producing the same levels of energy that they once did. Interestingly, ketogenic diets seem to help that. Fasting to some degree seems to help kind of reset that whole process. Chris Master John, has a great piece talking about how you don&#8217;t necessarily want to just throw some of these NAD products down the pie hole because it&#8217;s all part of an overall process in just supplementing one particular item doesn&#8217;t always address things.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> There&#8217;s not a ton of research. Like I poked around examine.com, a couple of other places trying to get a sense of if they&#8217;ve really vetted this stuff out. There&#8217;s not a ton of material on that. And so in this kind of like precursor, energy story, I would still kind of default to just cheap, good, well researched creatine monohydrate as a beneficial item to use. Even if somebody&#8217;s a non responder, where they don&#8217;t really get the performance boost with creatine monohydrate. There&#8217;s great examples of it improving, lipid levels, of it being neuro protective under hypoxic scenarios. So I could be really comfortable recommending something like creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Some of this other stuff, like the PKTP is basically, they&#8217;re providing ATP, and I just don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s really going to help that much. I don&#8217;t know if the ATP survives going through the gut and then gets put back together on the other side of the gut lumen, does all that stuff get used by microbes in the gut? There&#8217;s just a lot of different layers to that. So I have very little experience with it. I think it&#8217;s very early in the story. I think that people are largely chasing symptoms trying to address symptoms instead of underlying issue.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s see our next question is from Micheal on multivitamins. He&#8217;s asking, powder or pill? Micheal says, &#8220;If a person chooses to have a multivitamin, is it better in pill form of powder? To drink with water? I ask because fat soluble vitamins are absorbed in the presence of fat? And it would seem drinking a powder, for example, in a liter of water, over several hours, might mean that the vitamins might not be absorbed as well? No fatty meals in between to help absorb said vitamins. Where a pill could be taken with a meal or with a little fat.&#8221; Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, I think, there&#8217;s some &#8230; again quite a few things to consider there. Loren Cordain had an interesting paper, that I don&#8217;t know that he ever finished, or what happened with it. But he was actually working with some mathematicians trying to catalog every food imaginable, basically whole foods, in kind of like a 3D mapping of the amounts and distribution of vitamins and minerals in these foods. And so it would be like a 3D grid, and vitamin D in liver would be real big, and vitamin A in liver would be really big. But all these things kind of get mapped out. And what the preliminary work suggested that there was this kind of distribution within food, that is just really not well represented within supplements. Supplements tend to have far more of various things like B vitamins. They tend to occur in ratios that are not physiologically represented within food, again. And there was some thought around, in particular, these vitamins involved, the B vitamins in particular, specifically in the methylation pathways, there was some concern there that doing super physiological doses of vitamins that turn on and off methylation pathways could be problematic. These are some of the things that maybe are negative influences of cancer. So now, that&#8217;s a piece.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And then another piece of this story, is that although people are maybe overly geeked out fasting currently, I think that there&#8217;s a little bit of hype associated with that. If we could just figure out how to not over eat, eat two or three meals per day, that&#8217;s probably doing pretty well. But one of the key features of just not eating all the time, of not snacking all the time, of not drinking sugary beverages all the time, is that there are periods of rest for our whole system, the digestion, our vascular bed, all that type of stuff. So that&#8217;s kind of problematic in my mind from the prospective of drinking a vitamin concoction.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I think that Micheal&#8217;s spot on with the notion that there are some fat soluble vitamins that need some fat to be well absorbed. There is a company called New Chapter that has a &#8230; What they end up doing is they give, it&#8217;s kind of funny, the end up giving synthetic vitamins, because this is basically where most these things come from. Feed them to different yeast strains, then these things get kind of biocomplexed into the structures that we would see within food. And then they&#8217;ve created supplements that are really right at that kind of RDA recommendation, which there&#8217;s all kinds of hoopla around recommended daily allowance. And I know they changed it, like the minimum daily. I forget what they changed it to.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But the basic idea is, that they&#8217;re not off the charts, super high. In theory, they may be represent a little bit more what we would see with food. And so if I were to pick one or the other, and I would really ask the question, why do you need a multivitamin? The research, and it&#8217;s mainly epidemiological, but people taking multivitamins don&#8217;t live particularly longer, they don&#8217;t live longer than anybody else. There&#8217;s some suggestion they may not do as well as people not taking multivitamins. And this is within the healthy user bias scenario which in theory, people taking vitamins are overall more health conscious and whatnot. There was some really interesting stuff, people were taking. I forget if it was vitamin E or beta carotene supplements, or maybe a combination, but they were smokers. So they noticed from epidemiology people who ate a vitamin E rich diet with carotenoids tended to have fewer problems if they were smokers.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So they supplemented the stuff, and they had to stop the trial because these people started developing cancer at much higher rates than what they saw from the baseline. So you I&#8217;m a big fan of the right types of supplements under the right circumstances, but a lot of these trying to replace poor diet with supplements, it&#8217;s a tough thing. And people will probably rightfully point out that our soils are depleted, and food is harvested early, so it&#8217;s not as nutrient dense. There&#8217;s a lot of different layers and nuance to all that stuff. So I can appreciate that there are maybe compelling reasons to supplement. But I think it&#8217;s something that folks want to be a little bit careful with too. I wouldn&#8217;t run willy nilly into this.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So first thing, I would try to find something light, the new chapter product where it&#8217;s not a super physiological dose of these different nutrients. And then I would definitely take it with a meal, so that at a minimum these vitamins and minerals that would otherwise only be consumed with food, because it should be coming from food, that it&#8217;s actually available with that.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Actually with food.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay, let&#8217;s see, our next question is from Nathan on individualizing your diet. I have watched the change in dietary recommendations over the years, and have tried paleo, keto, and higher carb diets. I&#8217;ve seen really good results on low carb diets, but they seem hard to sustain due to high activity at work. I&#8217;ve also heard Robb say he has good results eating beans and legumes. I am considering trying to eat a diet that focuses on whole foods rather than macros. My question related to this is, have you found that the quality of food is more important than the macronutrients for overall health? Not that macros aren&#8217;t important, but you can manipulate the macros to a keto style diet with low quality food, but it seems that would be counterproductive.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So he&#8217;s asking for overall health, not necessarily weight loss.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, so it was interesting, this is where the nuances is interesting. From a blood sugar regulation standpoint, things like lentils, things like soak them, sprout them, do all that stuff. I have pretty good blood sugar regulation with that. I feel pretty good in that regard, but I start getting kind of almost feels like rheumatoid arthritis or something. My joints hurt, my feet hurt. I get this weird deal in my toes, and I really tried to play with that stuff, and probably tinkered on and off with it for the better part of a year, year and a half. And it&#8217;s interesting because historically I focused mainly on the blood sugar regulation problems that I&#8217;ve had, which is why I tend to gravitate towards a lower carb way of eating, keto, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But some of these legumes like lentils in particular, I seem to do fine from a blood sugar regulation, but then I got kind of a systemic inflammatory response. So I think the question is individualizing your diet, and so this is where I think in general yeah, focusing on whole foods at a three thousand foot level.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Whether you&#8217;re following a macro prescription or not.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Try to get whole foods.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, but then we have people that have oxalate issues, and histamine issues, and I&#8217;ve been noodling on some pieces that I want to write, or maybe do a video blog around this stuff. We should in theory be able to eat just about anything. So I&#8217;m going to say two different stories here, and they&#8217;re going to be somewhat contradictory. So on the one hand, I kind of have this notion that healthy humans should be able to drop into just about any environment, eat just about anything from this kind of whole largely unprocessed food story, and they should be able to motor along and do pretty well. The counter point that I have to that, and I&#8217;m still trying to track this thing down. I know I&#8217;ve got the paper somewhere, but it&#8217;s a historical account of explorers, and kind of their dietary misery when they go to new places.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So these Europeans that ended up in the Caribbean, and in Florida, these folks just reported having horrible GI problems, and they couldn&#8217;t wait to get home to be able to eat the food that they were raised on. And it was really interesting, and I read this other paper man, like five, six years ago, and I do know I&#8217;ve got it somewhere, I just haven&#8217;t been able to find it. But these are kind of the two things, the dueling banjos here. So we look at the story around the Hudsa, which they eat like 100 grams of fiber a day. They have these oxalate metabolizing bacteria. They&#8217;re super healthy, they seem real robust. But then what&#8217;s interesting, and this is some of the stuff I want to talk about at a deeper level, it does appear as people start eating any amount of westernized foods, they start losing some of that gut microbiota diversity, and so they start being forced into a little bit more limited of food options.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And then that may ultimately end up with someone like me, or like Mikhaila Peterson, Jordan Peterson, where I&#8217;m not in as big a cul de sac as those guys are, but they&#8217;re in the one cut carnivore deal. And for them, the only way that they can eat, and be healthy, is basically carnivore diet. And not just carnivore diet, but they seem to have largely gravitated towards one or two specific cuts of meat. So this is where when we really do put on this individualization hat, and I guess you could argue that eating ribeyes is still like they&#8217;re eating a largely whole unprocessed diet. It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re eating protein powder or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But it&#8217;s interesting I think, that we can use these big picture guidelines, to kind of set some lane lines. But then this is where we need to have a ton of respect for what each individual needs. Like you and I have documented these differences ad nauseum, and it was funny, even before writing Wired to Eat, we would go out to some Mexican food. And I always would do something like a fajita platter, skip the tortillas, skip the beans and rice generally, get some extra guacamole and that would go fine. And you would have some beans, some rice, some tortillas. I&#8217;d ask you, &#8220;How do you feel after that?&#8221; You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; And then a couple of times I would try doing the same meal that you had, and I was smashed. And I felt like shit then.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> For a while.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And I felt like shit for a couple of days, whereas you were like, just totally shook it off. And that was some of the stuff that in addition to the Whitesman Institute research, and some of the personalized glycemic response really got me thinking about that. So there&#8217;s the individual glycemic response, there&#8217;s the potential immunogenic response to foods, which is the problem that I think I have with lentils in particular. I think that from a blood glucose regulation perspective, I do fine with them. But there&#8217;s something about the immunogenic element that I don&#8217;t do well with. And again, I know I&#8217;ve soaked them, I&#8217;ve sprouted them, I&#8217;ve had the Dali Lama bless them. I&#8217;ve fucking done everything with that, so I appreciate the suggestions. But I&#8217;ve done due diligence on trying to make that shit work. I would like to eat as varied a diet as I can.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> This is kind of a funny thing, that I do advocate paleo, low carb, keto type diets. It is definitely what has worked best for me. 15 years ago I was much more of the opinion that this was the way that everybody should eat. At this point I think that it&#8217;s a great starting point, and then we see what type of latitude there is with that. But I&#8217;ll completely honest, if I could wave a magic wand, and I could go out and eat a gluten containing pizza, or just not get poisoned from gluten cross contamination and stuff like that, I would be pretty fucking happy about that. So I still push and endeavor to try to get more variety in my diet, but I&#8217;ve honestly been finding that something kind of lower vegetable matter to the degree I&#8217;m doing. A plant material, it&#8217;s more like fruit and stuff like that. I seem to do better, and I know that&#8217;s all over the map. But it&#8217;s an interesting topic.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And so getting back to Nathan, are macros important versus whole foods? I would say in general focusing on the whole food piece of that is probably the most important. But again, if we have somebody, so whole food could be lots of sweet potato, and lots of yams, stuff like that. And for one person that may be great, and for another person it&#8217;s going to be a disaster, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. Our next question is on collagen from Andrew. Hey Robb, I have a question on a point you made in the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">keto masterclass</a> module four. You said that collagen, specifically collagen protein powders are great supplements, and could have many benefits, but that the protein content should not count towards your daily protein intake. I have been making and eating a collagen concoction, a great lakes collagen hydrolysate for years.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Hydrolysate.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Hydrolysate for years as a second meal in between lunch and dinner. And I&#8217;ve been counting as a third of my protein intake. I understand that collagen protein is not the same as animal protein, but can you expand on this a bit? I remember reading something along the lines of it lacking completeness, not having optimal ratios of amino acids, and having some that are unessential. But have I really been short changing myself on protein, and should I replace this with animal protein?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So collagen typically is animal protein. It&#8217;s just not rich in the branch chain amino acids, and the essential amino acids, particularly lucine which causes an anabolic response. Now there is an argument for getting more collagen rich protein sources, and this is where eating [inaudible 00:18:23] and things like chicarones, and bone broth, and stuff like that are valuable, because we have an issue with the amount of glycine. We&#8217;re probably deficient in glycine, and overly abundant in methionine. And methionine comes from more like muscle meats, elevated levels of methionine relative to glycine can be pro inflammatory, that can lead into homocystine production. So there&#8217;s good argument, and again Chris Master John does a really nice job of unpacking this stuff. He does a deep dive as only the Master John can do on this.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So I would do a little poking around collagen, Chris Master John, he just does an amazing job with that. But are you short changing yourself by basically a third. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re eating 150 grams of protein a day, and you&#8217;re doing a 50 gram wack of collagen based protein that day. The thing that I think you&#8217;re probably doing well, is that you&#8217;re probably getting a nice balance of glycine to methionine. That&#8217;s probably a good thing, so long as you&#8217;re &#8230; And again, not knowing how big Andrew is, if he&#8217;s 175 pounds like 100 grams of non-collagen based protein is probably at the low end of what&#8217;s going to be enough anabolic signaling for him to maintain muscle mass, have good recovery, and all that type of stuff. So I don&#8217;t know that this would necessarily be the worst idea in the world. But you definitely want to make sure that those other protein feedings are of adequate protein amounts so that you get that anabolic signaling, and all of that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So on the one hand I think that it&#8217;s probably good, because again that glycine methionine ratio is probably being addressed effectively. Sounds like a super fucking easy meal too, it&#8217;s pretty quick. Makes up some sort of pudding type thing, and jam that down, and it probably tastes great in five minutes and no dramas with that. And it probably doesn&#8217;t have a lot of other gnarly not good ingredients. But at the same time, particularly from an aging and longevity perspective, you want a couple of anabolic pulses a day. We don&#8217;t want to eat seven meals a day, and constantly titrate that stuff in. But at the same time, if you&#8217;re going to eat fewer protein rich meals, which technically the collagen really doesn&#8217;t tick that box because of the lack of anabolic signaling. Then the two pulses, the breakfast, and the late dinner pulse, need to be significant. And so that&#8217;s the way that I would kind of noodle on that stuff. I would just make sure that the breakfast and the dinner pulses are really on point.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> So would you say that ideally he changes this out to some actual animal protein for the mid day meal, and then uses this when he&#8217;s in a jam and needs a quick fix?</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We are the crazy people that recommend that folks eat, chew, real food. I would love to see something like a can of sardines or something like this. But again, this is where maybe within his overall lifestyle, this is just super easy, and it&#8217;s enjoyable. And again, because of is he eating offal or other bone broth sources? Is he getting other collagen sources? And so if not, that could be, in a lot of ways he&#8217;s doing a good job of getting that balance. I guess you could make an argument for maybe in addition to the collagen protein adding something like a whey protein isolate or something like that. Some sort of a protein source that does have those branch chain amino acids. Like if he wanted to fill that gap, so he&#8217;s still getting the balanced glycine methionine ratio from the collagen, but then maybe propping up the anabolic signaling from a different source.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay. All right, our last question this week is from Jenika. She says her body refuses ketosis in her high stress work environment. Hello Robb, I have a question regarding the body naturally kicking itself out of ketosis in high stress work environments. I have been a fat burner now for over a year, and have been immensely successful. I&#8217;ve lost 15 pounds, gained muscle, rid myself of candida. My vision has improved, my alopecia hair loss has gone away, and I feel like I&#8217;m functioning the way I should. I also run faster, jump higher, and train better than I ever have in my life, I&#8217;m 29 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I work as a stewardess on private luxury yachts, so I live and work onboard. With no guests onboard I maintain a healthy balanced routine. When we have guests onboard, I&#8217;m working 14 to 16 hour days on my feet, running around, up and down stairs constantly. This can go from one week up to five weeks with no days off. I certainly don&#8217;t exercise during this time apart from light stretching and [inaudible 00:23:20] yoga. It is a high stress environment both mentally and physically. It seems that my body just refuses to stay in ketosis despite my dietary efforts. I crave fruit, I gain weight, I gain water weight, and I don&#8217;t feel satiated ever. I&#8217;m assuming this is because my body goes into fight or flight mode.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> My question is if there is anything I can do to trick the system into staying in ketosis, or should I just give into the body&#8217;s desire for glucose, and introduce fruit and perhaps sweet potato into the diet, and lower my fat intake? I guess I don&#8217;t want to be pumping myself full of fat if my body doesn&#8217;t want to use it for fuel. This is a constant occurrence in my job, given I haven&#8217;t worked full time in the last eight months, and I&#8217;m potentially going into a busy Mediterranean season and would like to maintain my physique and be gentle to my body considering the circumstances. Any insight you have is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Any thoughts on this?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> I&#8217;m noodling, and so I&#8217;m assuming, luxury yacht, she mentioned Mediterranean, or was it Mediterranean?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Mediterranean.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah, so probably going to be warm, probably humid, super high activity, low carb.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Need sodium.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Need sodium, yeah. So I&#8217;m curious Jenika, this is a great question. What you suggest here of just swapping out some fruit and sweet potatoes, and decreasing the fat, that&#8217;s totally doable, and honestly when I travel, particularly when we get more equatorial, that&#8217;s largely what I do unless I&#8217;ve got a stash of avocados. It&#8217;s just not as easy for me to keep the protein sources tend to be leaner, and so it&#8217;s just kind of easier to loosen that stuff up. And so that seems a natural place to go with that. But I guarantee you that inadequate sodium under any of these circumstances, is going to be a nasty problem.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> And so of course we will plug element in that scenario, but if you need something like chicken bullion, you need some pretty aggressive sodium supplementation. So given your activity, and assuming, even though I&#8217;m sure that the ships are air conditioned to some degree, I suspect that you&#8217;re going to be in warm, humid environments, and you&#8217;re go, go, go all the time. And so what&#8217;s interesting is you&#8217;re describing even some water retention and what not. But if you get into that hyponatremic state, what I would be really curious about, is do you have any problems going from seated to standing, and getting a little bit kind of-</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Kind of dizzy going up and down stairs, particularly the up, not so much the down. If there&#8217;s anything like that, as a baseline if you&#8217;re wanting to maintain a little bit more of the keto side of things, I would try to get that minimum of five grams of sodium a day, and get the bulk of your nutrition from whole unprocessed foods, and hopefully we&#8217;re really addressing the potassium and magnesium for the most part in that regard. I had one other thought. I would tinker with that, and then if it&#8217;s not working, then adjust the carbs a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> But you probably still need some more sodium. It&#8217;s interesting, again going back to American Council of Sports Medicine guidelines, active people in hot humid environments, their recommendation is 7 to 10 grams of sodium a day. And this is for a population that they&#8217;re assuming is eating like 800 grams of carbs a day. So if you&#8217;re eating significantly less than that, even if you go full on [inaudible 00:26:55] paleo, you&#8217;re not going to eat that many carbs. So I suspect that inadequate sodium is probably a big factor in this one, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> And then given the stress levels, it might be if you&#8217;re not already maybe considering something like a meditation practice. Just because it just can help.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> She&#8217;s so busy though, that&#8217;s going to be a tough one.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah, 14 to 16 hour days, so she&#8217;s barely getting eight hours of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yeah I haven&#8217;t done this, but I&#8217;ve done something similar to this. Where I was taking care of some super hoity toity people in sailing environments. And they&#8217;re fucking demanding, and they&#8217;re billionaire babies basically. And so right here, right now, all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> But maybe just when you&#8217;re drifting off to sleep, right when you first wake up, she can fit in a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Try to.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> She could try to fit in a little bit, I think it would help.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Or you have some GI distress.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Meditate on the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Yep. But that is a great recommendation. A podcast or two back, we mentioned the meditation stuff that we&#8217;ve been doing. And it&#8217;s been hugely helpful for us, you want to plug that again?</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Yeah it&#8217;s Emily Fletcher&#8217;s book, Stress Less, Accomplish More.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> No financial ties, just recommending it because it fucking works.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> It worked for us, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> So yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Okay, I think that was our last question for this week.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay, cool. You&#8217;re looking good goth, I like it, I like this. Maybe we&#8217;ll do some black eye shadow and stuff next time and really go for it.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Oh babe, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> Let&#8217;s see, as always if you guys have questions submit them at robbwolf.com to the contact page. We love answering your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Robb:</strong> We probably enjoy answering them more than you guys enjoy listening to them, but we do appreciate you or we wouldn&#8217;t be doing this. You guys ask great questions, and we continue to learn all the time from what you guys are trying to discover, so thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Nicki:</strong> All right, we&#8217;ll see you next time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trouble sleeping? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe you’re traveling and need to readjust to a new timezone or just are desperate to fall/stay asleep… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m sure you’ve tried melatonin or at least it’s come across during your research for ‘natural’ sleep supplements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But is taking an important neurotransmitter (melatonin) just going to perpetuate the struggle for your body to naturally initiate sleep? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Watch this video where I talk about the research on melatonin as well as my personal thoughts on it (or scroll down for the transcript):</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Thoughts On Melatonin?" width="740" height="555" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxIN8BC-5mY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want to try the microdose of melatonin (plus a lot of other natural sleep initiators), <a href="http://www.docparsley.com/robbwolf/">you can buy Doc Parsley’s Sleep Remedy here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Full Transcript:</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Nicki:</strong> So Robb, what are your thoughts on melatonin?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Robb:</strong> Oh man, that&#8217;s a goodie. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You know it&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve had some reservations around melatonin in the past, I mean you&#8217;re taking an important neurotransmitter that&#8217;s involved in the initiation of sleep, you know is there a possibility of down-regulating normal production? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the research on it is interesting, it suggests that it probably doesn&#8217;t down-regulate normal production, so you can use it and go off of it, and there&#8217;s typically not sleep latency problems and whatnot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I&#8217;ve definitely used it quite a bit with traveling, and I find it really helpful to kind of help to set up a new circadian environment, if you travel three or more time zones then it becomes more and more important to do that. Doing a little bit of fasting, getting out in the morning sun, really trying to sleep as close to the new timezone as you can is important, and melatonin can help set that up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But I&#8217;ve also noticed that if I, the kind of cool thing about melatonin is it&#8217;ll, for me, I&#8217;ll take a milligram-and-a-half to two milligrams, and it puts me out really quick. And that&#8217;s cool on the one hand, but what I&#8217;ve noticed is if I get kind of serial usage, I&#8217;ll use it multiple days in a row, I start getting depressed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think I end up in this almost kind of dopamine-deficient kind of brain state, I&#8217;m really lethargic, really tired in the morning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And there&#8217;s a decent amount of information in the literature that suggests that, for some people with different types of depression or tendency towards depression, Seasonal Affective Disorder and stuff like that, it can be a little bit of a double-edged sword. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> So if you have sleep problems I think that the first place to look, as much as possible, is trying to plug all the gaps in the circadian biology story, the circadian rhythm, getting outside early, getting sun on your person, getting sun in your eyes and all that, and then kind of somewhat sparingly using melatonin. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Also, <a href="http://www.docparsley.com/robbwolf/">Dr. Kirk Parsley put together the Sleep Remedy product</a>, which is cool in that it&#8217;s 200 micrograms of melatonin, so it&#8217;s a very small dose. And usually the sublingual tablets come in milligram doses, so you&#8217;re talking about a significantly higher level of melatonin entering the system potentially than what we would have under physiological conditions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So if you can find something that is a physiological dose, like that 200 micrograms, that might be more tenable over long-term usage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I would just definitely keep an eye on depressed feelings in the morning, and lethargy, and that type of thing. </span></p>

<p><b>1. <a href="https://youtu.be/mBBnoTy21wc">Ancestral Case For Salt Supplementation? </a></b>[0:53]<span id="more-20861"></span></p>
<p>Dan says:</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve recently been talking a lot about salt and electrolyte supplementation and I like to look at things in an ancestral context. &nbsp;Did pre-agricultural peoples supplement with salt somehow? I do know that the Hopi Indians in northern Arizona had a ceremonial &#8220;Salt Trail&#8221; into the Grand Canyon and I assume that they were able to retrieve salt from geologic deposits, but the amount of salt that feels optimal for me seems like it would be hard to attain in prehistoric times in many parts of the world. &nbsp;Are there other examples of this besides the Hopi?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5GGjn04lts">Resistant Starch On Keto? </a></b>[11:48]</p>
<p>Bethany says:</p>
<p>Hi there! I&#8217;m about 2 and a half weeks in to a ketogenic diet (following the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">Keto Masterclass</a>) and feeling pretty good. I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to add in some resistant starch for overall gut health without pushing carb levels too high. I think I would try tapioca starch first &#8211; I live in Asia and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s most readily available. According to nutrition facts online, a 1 oz. serving of tapioca starch has 6 grams of carbs. Would this number contribute at all to my overall carb count for the day, or does this factor out because of the fact that most of it is resistant to digestion? Hope my question makes sense. Thanks for your time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZoPPJkGWajU">Optimal Fructosamine Range? </a></b>[16:39]</p>
<p>Steven says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard you recommend checking fructosamine to help triangulate glycation and see what&#8217;s happening with blood sugar, but I can&#8217;t seem to find any references for an optimal fructosamine range.</p>
<p>I recently did some blood work and had a fasting glucose of 80 (mg/dL), A1c of 5.6, and fructosamine of 250 (umol/L). I have been experimenting with a glucometer recently and my average blood glucose based on dozens of readings during carb testing is in the upper 90&#8217;s, so I am thinking my A1c looks artificially high due to red blood cells living longer. Curious what you think of this, and what I can take away from the fructosamine value of 250.</p>
<p>For context: I am a 29-year-old male, 160 lbs, between 10-12% bodyfat and have been eating a mostly low-carb paleo diet for the past year, recently gravitating closer to carnivore.</p>
<p>I appreciate you and Nicki and all the work that you do!</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Steven</p>

<p><b>4</b><b>.</b><a href="https://youtu.be/3lf9WlUz4-w"><b> Finding Time For Writing a Book? </b></a>[22:34]</p>
<p>Thuy says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan. Thanks for your life&#8217;s work that filters out the vast ocean of information out there for a smarter living. I&#8217;m so glad you are doing what you do reminding me to sit back to look at the big picture of everything in life. In your last few podcasts, you mentioned that you are again working on publishing more books. Congrats and I can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to write my first book. It has been such a slow process. It has been 4 months and I&#8217;m able to get in about 6000 words or so. Holy cow it is such like a text book but I&#8217;ve got to start from somewhere! The book has a mix of East meets West medicines for those undergoing cancer treatments. Needless to say, the topic is not easy and there is so much development out there every week that it is hard to keep up. I&#8217;m a full-time oncology pharmacist. My husband also has a full-time job and soon will go back to school while working for the next 2 years. We have four kids ages 5, 7, 9 and 10 so their activities are endless Mondays through Sundays on top of their normal school work, church, and of course we have to add Vietnamese school in there because all others are not enough! I started out with trying to get a few words in during my lunch hour, but it seems that it takes me a good 15-20 min to get into a good writing mode but then I have to go back to work before I get much further into the book. If my kids have a long 1-2 hour activity, I can get more done then while waiting for them but I then I feel guilty for not paying attention to them. I also exercise daily, either before work or during lunch, whichever works out for the day. The past 2 months, I&#8217;ve been exercising during lunch rather than working on my book because I feel my brain needs a break from thinking all day long. Then I find myself slacking off for whatever excuse because, honestly, I&#8217;m just exhausted mentally and physically. So that&#8217;s my background story.</p>
<p>My question simply put, how do you do it? I feel the need to write this book because I know it will help so many people going through cancer treatments particularly clarifying the effectiveness/safety on herbal products and the big hot marijuana, so it&#8217;s almost like a calling; leaving a mark on this earth before I die. There is a war inside me between fulfilling this calling vs taking care of my health (recently discovered I have Hashimoto&#8217;s &#8211; oh boy that&#8217;s for another day) vs being a good mother, wife, sister (brother has Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis; also another story for another day), daughter. At first I set out a goal to finish this book in 2 years but maybe not until 5 years. Worst yet, it will never be finished. I&#8217;m starting to doubt myself that I can climb this Mount Everest of mine. Any suggestions will be great. Thanks for reading this.</p>

<p><b> 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/nJnUlmvW8IM">Advice For A New Clinician? </a></b>[38:38]</p>
<p>Matthew says:</p>
<p>Hello Robb and Nicki,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently become a newly minted nurse practitioner and am starting a job in an endocrinology clinic in a few weeks where I will be managing mostly type II diabetes and thyroid disorders. First, thank you for your work. 8 years ago you inspired my interest in fats, carbs, exercise, and all things hormonal and it is very unlikely I would have landed here without your influence. My mom read the &#8220;Paleo Solution&#8221; after I mentioned your name and effectively reversed her type II diabetes through diet, exercise, and a sprinkle of metformin (which she has since discontinued). The clinic I&#8217;ll be working in serves a population with low health and nutrition literacy that typically follow the standard american diet. As an example, one of my colleagues expressed that she would consider it a win if she could teach some of her patients that mountain dew is not actually considered juice (this is an extreme example, but you get the picture). &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been working as a bedside nurse for 6 years so I am well aware of the shortcomings of conventional medicine and the reluctance of patients to change long held behaviors. One of the reasons I&#8217;ve been drawn to diabetes care is that diabetes 2 is so amenable to diet and lifestyle change that ideally the pharmacological approach need only play a supplemental and transient role. My question is this: What would you consider effective strategy for fostering health literacy and behavior change in a population such as this? Also: What would you consider the lowest hanging fruit in terms of behavioral change to positively affect outcomes in diabetes?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, your work, and your example</p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s see. Our first question this week is from Dan on the ancestral case for salt supplementation. He says, you&#8217;ve recently been talking a lot about salt and electrolyte supplementation and I&#8217;d like to look at things in an ancestral context. Did pre agricultural people supplement with salt somehow? I do know that the Hopi Indians in Northern Arizona had a ceremonial salt trail into the Grand Canyon and I assume they were able to retrieve salt from geologic deposits but the amount of salt that feels optimal for me seems like it would be hard to attain in prehistoric times in many parts of the world. Are there other examples of this besides the Hopi?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Really good question and clearly, I like to frame things from an ancestral health perspective and this has been one of the challenging things to weave into the orthodox paleo-ite information that came out of Loren Cordain early on, which suggested that a very low sodium intake was what a true paleo diet would be represented by but what&#8217;s interesting is consistently, when we had people eat that way, they felt horrible and it wasn&#8217;t just for a brief period of time. If you started pushing the athletic activities out at all, then people really really suffered and then if you default back to the American Council of Sports Medicine guidelines, in general, for population at large, if somebody is exercising a lot, if it&#8217;s hot, if it&#8217;s humid, the ACSM guidelines, like the orthodox missionary style people, are recommending between 7 and 10 grams of sodium a day, which is close to 14 to 20 teaspoons of table salt a day. I mean it&#8217;s a remarkable amount. This is where it&#8217;s been hard to kind of square the ancestral health perspective with the clinical outcome, like what actually makes people look, feel, and perform better.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I started doing some digging and I guess in some ways you could make the case that this is trying to create a certain confirmation bias around what we&#8217;re up to. I mean we&#8217;re selling Element. We help people with ketogenic diets. They need to supplement salt. You could make the case that it&#8217;s self serving for us to construct a narrative around the fact that people need more sodium and it may in fact be true that people need more sodium, so I mean yeah, whatever with that but I started noodling on this and I did some poking around on the whole body sodium content of mammals at large, which is what I was able to track down and I found it with mountain goats and cattle and humans and what was interesting is, in general, mammals tend to have about four grams of sodium per kilogram of overall body weight, so this is distributed through the whole critter.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some of it is going to be disproportionately distributed and a higher concentration of sodium tends to be in the plasma and the extracellular areas, whereas inside cells, we tend to have a higher concentration of potassium and this is part of the whole biological process that&#8217;s life itself of creating a gradient of sodium being in higher concentrations outside of cells, potassium being in higher concentrations inside cells, and the normalization of that gradient is how we drive the electron transport system and it&#8217;s kind of nerve impulses, it&#8217;s the way that life works. We have more sodium outside of cells than in cells. The way that animals are typically slaughtered and processed in westernized societies, the animals are killed and then bled.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A major reservoir of the sodium is removed, right immediately at death and so when you look at the nutrition information on meat in general, it&#8217;s about one gram of sodium per kilogram of meat. We&#8217;ve got a spread there of one gram of sodium per kilogram of meat in processed finished food whereas we&#8217;ve got about four grams of sodium per kilogram of critter, that includes the hair and the skin and the nails and the bones and all that type of stuff, so I have been unable to track down information on what the sodium content of muscle meat and organs would be if all the stuff was allowed to equilibrate but it&#8217;s got to at least be double what we&#8217;re seeing and so that&#8217;s definitely going to be a source of sodium. Another piece to this story, and this is really controversial, particularly within kind of the more mainstream dietetics world, which is, what&#8217;s the answer for all health ails? What do you need to do? Drink more water.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Drink more water.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s always the fucking &#8230; Oh, drink more water. Just drink more water, that&#8217;s going to fix everything and I did a piece on that and it&#8217;s largely bullshit and it may in fact be counterproductive for what we see with regards to electrolyte status because the big problem that occurs when people are eating lower carb in general is that they start getting this downward spiral of diaeresis and a loss of sodium and then a loss of potassium and these things-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you&#8217;re drinking more water, they&#8217;re-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If they drink more water, it makes it even worse. Yeah and I&#8217;ll try to remember to get this paper put in the show notes but it looks at athletes that are exercising and they brought these people up to a level where they would expect cramping to start to begin, like a level of exertion and heat and all that stuff and they supplemented one group with a sodium and electrolyte mix, really weak one, but still, it was there, versus giving other folks just water and the people that were given water, the cramping was much much worse. Much more severe, almost uniform across the board within this group of people that were just given water, versus the group of folks that were given electrolytes. Within this ancestral health story, I think people are generally drinking too much water. That&#8217;s another piece of this and I&#8217;m drinking coffee, I&#8217;ve had a couple of cups of coffee already. I&#8217;ll probably have more. You could-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Primarily decaf.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Primarily decaf at this point. I do a little bit of caff in the morning but the point being that if I wanted to emulate an ancestral health approach more truly, I wouldn&#8217;t be drinking three or four 16 ounce cups of fluid that is largely devoid of electrolyte. I think that a lot of the need to replenish electrolytes is actually an out growth of over consuming fluids in general, water also, and then this one gets out there a little bit far a field but there&#8217;s an argument that if people are, not necessarily just specifically ketogenic but if they&#8217;re more fat fueled, more metabolically flexible, depending on the size of the individual and the activity level and whatnot, producing metabolic water, which is the byproduct of fat metabolism, could account for 100 to 200 milliliters of water per day.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If we&#8217;re generating water endogenously, we&#8217;re not diluting it the way that we are just supplementing from outside and that may be more of the background environment that we see, which is lower general fluid intake, some amount of water that we experience physiologically being the consequence of metabolism and then finally, there may have been a bit more sodium in the diet than what we&#8217;ve historically thought. There are salt deposits all over the world, lots of people and the theory is that humans spread coastally and then worked their way inland and typically when they worked their way inland, they followed waterways and there&#8217;s oftentimes salt deposits. That starts getting into a lot of just so story type bullshit, that is really hard to support but there are some other mechanisms going on there that kind of paints the reason why &#8230; or maybe supportive notion around the way that ancestral diets could be validated by current sodium intakes that we&#8217;re recommending and then also again, at the end of the day, if people are eating kind of a lower carb paleo type diet or just paleo diet in general and they&#8217;re experiencing fatigue and lethargy, if they have sleep disturbances-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If they have cramps.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If they have some leg cramps and HPA axis dysregulation and stuff like that and all of that is resolved by adding a couple of grams of sodium per day, then whether this actually fits the ancestral health model or not is kind of meaningless. That&#8217;s where these things really valuable and again, I don&#8217;t want to just turn &#8230; I don&#8217;t want to get in and look at this in such a way that I&#8217;m just creating confirmation bias to support recommending salt and selling Element, but at the same time, I do think that there&#8217;s a strong case to be made both from the ancestral health perspective but also from just the clinical outcome perspective and fuck, that was a long answer but there&#8217;s a lot of nuance to this stuff and it&#8217;s a very good question and a lot of the problems that we see with health and just all the stuff, using that ancestral health model is really really valuable and it&#8217;s really where the discussion should begin but it&#8217;s also definitely not where the process should stop, just because pre-agricultural people did what we assume to be X, Y, or Z, doesn&#8217;t meant that we do that because one, some things may have changed in the intervening time and two, our assumptions may be wrong and that&#8217;s the really dangerous thing.</span></span></span></p>

How do you feel? How do you perform? Are biomarkers of health and disease going in favorable directions? Then we&#8217;ve got a pretty close package and probably, if there is a paradox there, it&#8217;s probably because our assumptions about the ancestral state are wrong. That&#8217;s what I would put forward. I would actual put a lot more weight on the clinical outcome side than at the end of the day, then the kind of building the whole story around the ancestral health side.</span></span></span></p>

Our next question is from Bethany on resistance starch on keto. Bethany says, hi there, I am about two and a half weeks into a ketogenic diet following the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">Keto Masterclass</a> and feeling pretty good. I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to add in some resistance starch for overall gut health without pushing carb levels too high. I think I would try tapioca starch first. I live in Asia and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s most readily available. According to nutrition facts online, a one ounce serving of tapioca starch has six grams of carbs. Would this number contribute at all to my overall carb count for the day or does this factor out because of the fact that most of it is resistant to digestion? I hope my question makes sense. Thanks for your time.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Really good question and I think the point about how much of that six grams of resistance starch is going to manifest as a blood glucose response, is really hard to pin down. I&#8217;m blanking on the fiber that is used in a lot of the low carb and keto cookies and stuff like that, it&#8217;s corn derived but Tyler was talking to me about this and there is massive variation from person to person. This is pretty well documented in literature. One person will eat that kind of resistance starch and they literally get no blood glucose response and we may see increased levels of butyrate or propynate, these short chained fats that we want to come about from this type of fiber digestion and other people get a really frisky blood glucose response because it looks like either the human enzymes or the gut associated enzymes with bacteria allow those fibers to actually be cleaved in a way and then the glucose enters the bloodstream.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s really hard to know on that. There&#8217;s another piece to this that it wasn&#8217;t Erica Sonnenburg, it&#8217;s her husband who runs the Sonnenburg Lab at Stanford, when the potato starch thing was super hot and heavy and people were supplementing with potato starch, I got to talk to him about that and he said that when he first heard about that, he was very nervous about basically mono cropping the gut microbiome, like you&#8217;re dumping a huge amount of one item in there and then you play all of your gut microbiome to that and in fact, that&#8217;s what they saw. They saw loss of diversity and a shift towards what we generally associate being kind of a pathogenic gut microbiome profile. I wouldn&#8217;t &#8230;</span></span></span></p>

Not the ax handle, we teased our good friend about that recently, so that&#8217;s a whole other aside but I would focus on things like artichokes and asparagus and nuts and seeds to the degree they&#8217;re tolerated. I would just try to get as much variety in this story as you can instead of trying to selectively dose one thing. That said, if you wanted to put &#8230; If you cook some tapioca and then you chill it in the refrigerator overnight and you do maybe like a teaspoon or a tablespoon of it in addition to onions and leeks and kale and chard and just as much different fibrous vegetable material as you can &#8230; Jicama is really good. It&#8217;s got some carb but again, you do a couple slices of it and you&#8217;re going to be right as rain and it has a nice varieties of different fibers in it. I would focus more on just getting variety and then if you want to throw a little tablespoon here and there of a tapioca starch and maybe if you can track down potato starch. An idea around this is to cook some tapioca, some potato, and some rice together, chill it, and then do a little bit of that because even then, you&#8217;re going to get a broader-</span></span></span></p>

Even that is going to be a broader profile of fermentable carbohydrates than just doing one and again, you use it as a supplement-</span></span></span></p>

Hi Robb, I have heard you recommend checking fructosamine to help triangulate glycation and see what&#8217;s happening with blood sugar but I can&#8217;t seem to find any references for an optimal fructosamine range. I recently did some blood work and had a fasting glucose of 80 milligrams per deciliter. A1C of 5.6 and a fructosamine of 250. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a glucometer recently and my average blood glucose based on dozens of readings during carb testing is in the upper 90s, so I&#8217;m thinking my A1C looks artificially high due to the red blood cells living longer. I&#8217;m curious to what you think of this and what I can take away from the fructosamine value of 250. For context, I&#8217;m a 29 year old male, 160 pounds, between 10 and 12% body fat, and have been eating a mostly low carb paleo diet for the past year, recently gravitating closer to carnivore. I appreciate you and Nicki and all the work that you do.</span></span></span></p>

This is one of the ongoing challenges and we&#8217;re actually doing some surveys of folks right now wanting to know where their major challenges occur with blood work as it relates to understanding their health and so we&#8217;re going to be tinkering with some ways of helping people really unpack that because there was a shocking amount-</span></span></span></p>

Folks will get an A1C and it&#8217;ll be on the high side. They might do then some sort of a fasting blood test in the morning, whether they do it at home or elsewhere, and that looks a little bit on the high side and they&#8217;re like, damn, this stuff is all screwed up and wrong and backwards but they&#8217;re eating pretty low carb, they&#8217;re active, their sleep is good, and so you&#8217;re like-</span></span></span></p>

It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know and there are some scenarios like Doctor Sean Baker is really interesting in that he eats no carbohydrate but he has a remarkably high fasting blood glucose and a pretty elevated A1C. We tend to see profiles like that in elite level athletes. Whether or not that&#8217;s pathological is up for debate. Some folks think it is, some folks think it&#8217;s not but this is one of these kind of paradoxical things that occurs there but what&#8217;s interesting and it should be maybe a little bit informative, it is well understood that when folks are eating a lower carbohydrate diet, red blood cells may live two or three times longer than normal. I think the normal lifespan of RBCs is about 90 days and it can dramatically extend the life cycle of these red blood cells. Now that&#8217;s a whole interesting thing in and of itself when you think about health and longevity because these red blood cells come online and then they live and then they die and then we need to allocate more stem cells to produce-</span></span></span></p>

Those stem cells are a finite resource and once they&#8217;re gone, they&#8217;re kind of gone and this is why people may motor along pretty well and then all of the sudden they just crater because they&#8217;ve literally depleted their whole stem cell pool and that&#8217;s a whole other thing and you and I never got to bank our fetal chord blood or anything, so we&#8217;re kind of out of luck in that regard but a way that we can triangulate in on this story is looking at fructosamine. Fructosamine is another marker of advanced glycation end products but it deals with the blood albumin, not with the red blood cell surface.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s a way that we can kind of triangulate in on this and for the reference range and Steven, I don&#8217;t know man, not to be a dick but fructosamine ranges, they&#8217;re pretty easy to track down on the inter webs and they tend to be about 200 to 280 for the fructosamine ranges. His is 250, which is a little bit at the higher end of normal. There might be a little bit of something going on there but I mean the thing is though is that 5.6 A1C is inching into peri diabetic range according to the A1C reading. It is not remotely close to the peri diabetic range when we&#8217;re considering the fructosamine number. This is still in kind of trying to triangulate in on this. The fasting blood glucose is not particularly high in general.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The A1C looks a little high and then the fructosamine is kind of middle. It&#8217;s not super high, it&#8217;s not super low. It&#8217;s a little ambiguous. It doesn&#8217;t ferret this stuff out all the time but those are the ranges, about 200 to 280. Steven is a little bit at the higher end of normal but all things considered, I&#8217;m not really seeing a real significant issue here but these are the things to think about, is sodium intake on point? Is sleep good? What time you going to bed? What time are you getting up? These other stress factors and is Steven, you mentioned basically low carb, paleo. He doesn&#8217;t really mention his activity level. It is possible some people that are very very active can experience chronically elevated blood glucose levels, just from the activity. We saw this in the crossfit scene in general. It first got on my radar when we would see type 1 diabetics in crossfit and their blood glucose levels would go to the moon post exercise because of the stress response. Yeah.</span></span></span></p>

Our next question is from Thuy on finding time for writing a book. Hi Robb, I&#8217;m a big fan. Thanks for your life&#8217;s work that filters out the vast ocean of information out there for a smarter living. I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re doing what you do, reminding me to sit back to look at the big picture of everything in life. In your last few podcasts, you mention that you were again working on publishing more books. Congrats and I can&#8217;t wait. I&#8217;ve been trying to write my first book. It&#8217;s been such a slow process. It&#8217;s been four months and I&#8217;m able to get in about 6,000 words or so.</span></span></span></p>

The book has a mix of east meets west medicines for those undergoing cancer treatments. Needless to say, the topic is not easy and there&#8217;s so much development out there every week that it&#8217;s hard to keep up. I&#8217;m a full time oncology pharmacist. My husband also has a full time job and will soon go back to school while working for the next two years. We have four kids, ages 5, 7, 9, and 10. Holy cats. So their activities are endless Mondays through Sundays on top of their normal school work, church, and of course we have to add Vietnamese school in there because all others are not enough.

If my kids have a long one to two hour activity, I can get more done then while waiting for them but then I feel guilty for not paying attention to them. I also exercise daily either before work or during lunch, whichever works out for that day. The past two months, I&#8217;ve been exercising during lunch rather than working on my book because I feel my brain needs a break from thinking all day, then I find myself slacking off for whatever excuse because honestly, I&#8217;m just exhausted mentally and physically. So that&#8217;s my background story.</span></span></span></p>

I feel the need to write this book because I know it will help so many people going through cancer treatments, particularly clarifying the effectiveness and safety on herbal products and the big hot marijuana, so it&#8217;s almost like a calling, leaving a mark on this earth before I die. There is a war inside me between fulfilling this calling versus taking care of my health, recently discovered I have Hashimoto&#8217;s and oh boy, that&#8217;s for another day, versus being a good mother, wife, sister, my brother has hypokalemic periodic paralysis, also another story for another day and a daughter. At first, I set out a goal to finish this book in two years but maybe not until five years. Worse yet, it will never be finished. I&#8217;m starting to doubt myself that I can climb this Mount Everest of mine. Any suggestions will be great. Thanks for reading this, Thuy.</span></span></span></p>

The thought that you&#8217;re trying to write for 15 or &#8230; during a lunch break, seems probably more stressful than not because you&#8217;re context shifting. Like you said, it takes a couple minutes to get into it and then by the time you maybe are in a good vein, you&#8217;ve got to go back to work. One suggestion and again, it sounds like with four kids and all that you guys have going on, I don&#8217;t know how reasonable this is but maybe blocking off a Saturday morning chunk of time where maybe your husband can take care of the kids or if you have family in town, you can have somebody cover for you and you go and get like four hours early in the morning of writing and again, it might be different for you. I know you prefer to write first thing when you wake up. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re most creative and you have the best productivity and focus.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I was depressed but I was not really making good decisions, I was so exhausted. Where it was like, I&#8217;m just going to keep working and you were like, no, you&#8217;re going to fucking kill yourself and I mean I literally &#8230; I was so out of sync with reality that I was just like, I&#8217;m going to keep going and going. One thing is, given your current schedule and one thing that I notice with a lot of people, they do not spend enough time outlining their book and there&#8217;s a great online tool that you can download, it&#8217;s either free or it&#8217;s cheap.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s called Omni Outliner and I would spend three months or six months just outlining and you outline and outline and outline and while you&#8217;re outlining, you create a couple of Google Doc locations where you start putting references and you organize the references based off roughly where things are going to go in the kind of chapter by chapter format but what I find for a lot of people is without adequate outline, you&#8217;re trying to keep the whole thing straight in your head and with a really remarkably good outline, so the outline that I did for the Paleo Solution, I thought I spent a lot of time on it but the outline was maybe about 12 pages long and the editing process was much longer and arguably more difficult in different ways than what Wired to Eat was but my outline for Wired to Eat was almost 40 pages long and I mean literally, bullet point outline, sub category, boom, boom, boom. In my head, I&#8217;m not &#8230; I&#8217;m more of a Venn diagram person, so outlining things is not my natural default state but you just have to do that but then what that allows you to do is a couple of things.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One is that someone who knows nothing about a topic, you&#8217;ll know that you&#8217;re pretty on point with your outline when someone who knows nothing about a topic, you can show it to them, hey, read this and give me your thoughts and if the outline can make sense to the person about what you&#8217;re trying to do and what the ideas are that you&#8217;re getting across, then you&#8217;re ready to start writing. If not, you&#8217;re not ready to start writing. You need more granularity in the writing process and again, what this is going to do, it&#8217;s going to make it easier. You can do almost like magazine or blog length pieces, which are easier to kind of wrap your head around and you can look at the outline. You&#8217;re like, okay, I just did this. Oh yeah, I want to do this and it makes it easier. Thuy made the point that new material pops up all the time. That really robust outline makes it easier like, oh, there&#8217;s this amazing new paper. Bam, you put a link in there and a note. It&#8217;s like, okay, we need to emphasize this.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I would spend a lot more time outlining, one, is what you need to do and then the way that we have done it and I don&#8217;t want to be a whiny turd about this but it&#8217;s been really fucking hard. When I did the first book, we were still running the gym and I basically abdicated all of my training, virtually all of my responsibilities, and Nicki ran everything for the six to nine months that it took me to do that. I had an okay outline by that point but I had worked on that and then when I got in to write, that was the first time we got an office out of the house too and it was literally like-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That was pre kid.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That was pre kid, pre dog. We had a cat but that cat was easier to maintain, so it was a much simpler life in a lot of ways but even then, I need to be out of the house. I mean it was literally kind of like 1950s, peck you on the cheek, hard hat, lunchbox, and I went to my office and all that was in the office was a wireless router-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A chair.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">-a chair and a table to put my coffee on and that was it. That was the only shit that I had in there but I was able to get that done and when I worked on Wired to Eat, we similarly got an office out of the house and you don&#8217;t have to do that but that work life separation is a pretty big deal. We&#8217;re podcasting from kind of an office, right?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Right.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And it&#8217;s not the easiest thing in the world sometimes because that work life deal really becomes problematic. A couple of thoughts, really work on the outline. When you feel like the outline is in just solid solid shape, that somebody who doesn&#8217;t really know the topic can read through it and understand the thought process, then you&#8217;re probably ready to write and then you and your husband need to sit down and talk some turkey about what are you guys willing to give up for some period of time to be able to get this thing done? Maybe you need to go on a half shift for a period of time to be able to get this stuff knocked out and she&#8217;s a pharmacist, right?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">She&#8217;s an oncological pharmacist. Maybe you&#8217;re able to do three 10 hour days or something and then maybe three days are dedicated to writing and then you&#8217;ve got some other days for family but you just &#8230; If you&#8217;re going to get it done, you&#8217;re most likely going to have to give some stuff up somewhere. That&#8217;s if you do the book yourself. There&#8217;s another option within this story and I did a podcast with Tim Grahl, the guy who helped me launch my book and we talked about all these different variables about why you would write a book and how you would publish it. That&#8217;s a whole other story here is, how do you want to publish this? What&#8217;s your goal with that?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you don&#8217;t have an online presence, the likelihood of even getting it published may be low. You may end up getting shoehorned into some sort of a self publishing route, which isn&#8217;t the worst thing in the world but that&#8217;s a whole other layer to this whole story. You do all this work and then what ultimately is the goal there? So two thoughts around that. One is that because you&#8217;re doing these blog length pieces because of your good outlines, start releasing it as a blog and then you can start dripping this out to the world and maybe you can start helping people immediately.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And build a little bit of a platform.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And build some platform, build some presence. The really cool thing about that too is that you will get a bunch of feedback from people so that you can start, oh &#8230; As authors, we always make assumptions about what the reader is going to understand and then when you start getting feedback, a lot of times you&#8217;re like, I can&#8217;t believe this person is not getting this but they don&#8217;t and then you have to figure out a way to kind of deal with that. The one downside of that is people love pinching other folks shit and not attributing it. There&#8217;s a little bit of a challenge there but there is also the reality that it sounds like you have a world caliber expertise that&#8217;s going to be hard for somebody to just pinch and run off into the sunset with. Publishing this serially as part of a blog series could make a lot of sense because of the feedback and also, you&#8217;ll get a sense of accomplishment. Each time you drop one of these things, it&#8217;s going to be one more piece that&#8217;s done and it&#8217;s out there and you&#8217;re getting this stuff cranked out and then the other potentiality is a ghost writer.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I was just going to say, okay-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Is the ghost writer where somebody sits down and interviews you and about 99% of the health and fitness books that are published are ghost written, so a person &#8230; Nicki would sit down, interview me, ask a bunch of questions, maybe look at written material I already have, then she uses a very formulaic format to then start writing the book and this is why the bulk of health and fitness books look like the same book because it&#8217;s written exactly the same way and it&#8217;s not to say that the information isn&#8217;t good in there and if you detect a little bitterness, I definitely have that. I&#8217;m the fucking sucker that still sits down and does my own stuff because I kind of like the process and I like getting my voice out there and whatnot.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And you have a very unique voice.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah and a lot of what I &#8230; not that I am remotely like Stephen King in any way but he has mentioned that he doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s going to write. He only discovers it as the next word is predicated from the word he just wrote. It literally is that creative process and it&#8217;s an emergent process, so depending on how you&#8217;re wired up, you may be really well suited to finding someone to help you kind of ghostwrite the book but again, you&#8217;re going to have to allocate resources up front on that most likely but that could dramatically curtail the amount of time that you have to invest in this and those are other things that you can do too, like if you&#8217;re just sitting in the car, you can dictate to yourself ideas, then you email that to yourself. You can send that out and have it transcribed and then maybe that&#8217;s 85% usable but let&#8217;s say you get 2,000 words of material with that and it&#8217;s 85% usable, it&#8217;s still going to be way faster than sitting down and just writing it and then you had an additional thought?</span></span></span></p>

It&#8217;s just been the drizzling shit. It&#8217;s not particularly great for our relationship in a lot of ways too. It&#8217;s very stressful, very straining, but I would actually argue the point that she needs to figure out a way of allocating the time and resources to get it done and then set a very concrete deadline because otherwise, it will just stretch on forever.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">How we met, yeah. Yeah but I bet he didn&#8217;t tell her to go fuck herself basically like you did me.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I did not say that. I did not say that. I did not say that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You didn&#8217;t say it but the implication was definitely there.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">My face might have looked like I was saying that but I didn&#8217;t say it. All right, our last question this week is from Matthew on advice for a new clinician. Hello Robb and Nicki. I&#8217;ve recently become a newly minted nurse practitioner and I&#8217;m starting a job at an endocrinology clinic in a few weeks, where I will be managing mostly type 2 diabetes and thyroid disorders. First, thank you for your work. Eight years ago you inspired my interest in fats, carbs, exercise, and all things hormonal and it is very unlikely I would have landed here without your influence. My mom read The Paleo Solution after I mentioned your name and effectively reversed her type 2 diabetes through diet, exercise, and a sprinkle of Metformin, which she has since discontinued.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The clinic I&#8217;ll be working in serves a population with low health and nutrition literacy that typically followed the standard American diet. As an example, one of my colleagues expressed that she would consider it a win if she could teach some of her patients that Mountain Dew is not actually considered juice. This is an extreme example but you get the picture. I&#8217;ve been working as a bedside nurse for six years, so I&#8217;m well aware of the shortcomings of conventional medicine and the reluctance of patients to change long held behaviors.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One of the reasons I&#8217;ve been drawn to diabetes care is that diabetes 2 is so minimal to diet and lifestyle change that ideally, the pharmacological approach need only play a supplemental and transient role. My question is this, what would you consider an effective strategy for fostering health literacy and behavior change in a population such as this? Also, would you consider the &#8230; What would you consider the lowest hanging fruit in terms of behavioral change to positively affect outcomes in diabetes. Thank you for your time, your work, and your example.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well one, I&#8217;m honored that we&#8217;ve had a role in someone entering the scene and I think, Matthew, you&#8217;re really on point. That whole diabetic, peri diabetic world is something that is really damaging, remarkably costly, and it&#8217;s something that can be fixed if we can get out in front of it early enough and I think one of the best examples that I have in this story is Doctor Mark Cucuzella who works at a VA hospital in a rural environment, low socioeconomic status, low general education of the folks he works with, but I believe he has a one sheet paper that he gives people and there&#8217;s like a green list of foods, a yellow list of foods, and a red list of foods, and he&#8217;ll sit down with them and he&#8217;ll say, hey, what on this green list do you like for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And they circle the stuff and maybe Mark&#8217;s got this thing available online. I&#8217;m sure he would share it with folks if he doesn&#8217;t but he&#8217;ll go through the green list and then he&#8217;s like, okay, the yellow list, you can have a few of those and then the red list, I don&#8217;t want you to have anything on it and he just explains that typically the red list is loaded with carbs and he covers things like chicken fried steak and all this stuff because it&#8217;s a southern, rural kind of thing and instead of chicken &#8230; and people complain. They&#8217;re like, hey man, steak and eggs, just don&#8217;t batter it and roll it and so he keeps it super simple and he&#8217;s had remarkable success with people and I think one of the things is he keeps it incredibly simple. He sits down and immediately makes it about the patient. What do you &#8230;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">What on this list works for you? What do you like? And that&#8217;s just genius. It&#8217;s so smart and even though folks may come from modest means and background, they&#8217;re not dumb and so not everybody is going to change. These behaviors are hard to change. There&#8217;s deep seated kind of patterns from social interaction and just habits and whatnot but a lot of people are also like, yeah, I don&#8217;t want to lose my leg the way that my dad did or something like that and so the motivation can definitely be there but it sounds like he just meets these people where they are and you know what? Also I&#8217;m kind of blanking on the piece of this. He&#8217;s just incredibly accessible. Every single patient, he gives them his cell phone number. He&#8217;s like, if you&#8217;re in the store and you don&#8217;t know what to buy, you&#8217;re in the snack aisle and you don&#8217;t know what to do, you text me or you phone me and I will get you squared away.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">He&#8217;s super fucking accessible and I think he&#8217;s using a few health coaches now to kind of help augment that thing but this is another piece of this. There have been billions of dollars dumped &#8230; billions and billions of dollars dumped into apps trying to Facebook or Twitterize health changes and they&#8217;ve all failed. It just doesn&#8217;t fucking work. A well run crossfit gym, a good yoga studio, or jiu jitsu facility, that talks to people about food and exercise also, that shit works because there&#8217;s community and there&#8217;s cohesion and there&#8217;s a reason for being. Him giving his cell phone number out isn&#8217;t just information, it&#8217;s the relationship, it&#8217;s the fact he gives a shit enough to do that and so he can talk the person off the ledge and like Tyler and Louise and they&#8217;re coaches with Ketogains, this is why they&#8217;re so fucking successful and it&#8217;s a reasonably high touch process.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">They&#8217;re not just farming them off and here&#8217;s this super algorithmically driven thing. They&#8217;ve got pieces of that because there are consistencies within these different processes but at the end of the day, they build a relationship and they&#8217;re accessible and they do hard fucking work to help people change and so Matthew, it sounds like you&#8217;re fully ready to do all that. You&#8217;ve already done all the major suffering around just all the schooling and choosing to go into an area that is both potentially very rewarding but also very frustrating, but you&#8217;ve got your eyes wide open on that but I think adopting a very simple approach like what Doctor Cucuzella has done and then being very accessible and I would noodle on early year as opposed to later integrating health coaches into the process so that your primarily role, in my opinion, should be the management of the onboarding and off boarding of medications and you definitely should build relationship but I think that where you can get a little bit of scale and increased reach and not go crazy in this process is leaning heavily on some type of health coach.</span></span></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ketogenic diet is an increasingly popular option for people looking for a natural way to lose weight and burn fat. In certain cases, the diet&#8211;which is low in carbohydrates, high in healthful fats, and moderate in protein&#8211;can even be used to help manage a variety of chronic illnesses, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, when people begin researching the ketogenic diet, one of the first phrases they encounter is a pretty scary one: “the keto flu.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the keto flu is one of the most dreaded side effects of the ketogenic diet, it is actually a sign that you’re on the right track! The condition is a direct consequence of reducing carbohydrates and transitioning your body into a state of ketosis, and there are a number of steps you can take to mitigate its severity&#8211;or prevent it entirely.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">What Is The Keto Flu?</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The keto flu, which is not actually a “flu” at all since it’s not viral in nature, is a constellation of symptoms that often accompany the first days or weeks of a ketogenic diet. Symptoms include fatigue, headaches, brain fog, muscle cramps, dizziness, nausea, and lethargy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">There is high variability among individuals both in the incidence and severity of these symptoms, which is thought to be driven by differences in individuals’ metabolism as well as their diet pre-adherence to the ketogenic diet. It’s easy to see how this is one of the most commonly cited reasons why people abandon keto: they start the diet, feel terrible almost immediately and shortly thereafter decide that the ketogenic diet is not for them. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">However, it is our hope that a better understanding of this condition and how to manage it will help empower new adherents to stick with the diet and reap its long-term benefits.</span></p>
<h4 class="p4"><span class="s1">Keto Flu Symptoms</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1">Fatigue</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Headaches</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Brain fog</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Muscle cramps</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Dizziness</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Nausea</span></li>
<li><span class="s1">Lethargy</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">For the average person, carbohydrates have been the cornerstone of their diet since the day they were first introduced to solid food by their parents. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In fact, many nutritional guidelines today suggest we consume anywhere from 40-60% of our total daily calories from carbohydrates. Unfortunately, these carbohydrates are often derived from high-processed junk food and refined sugars with low nutritional quality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Even if the carbohydrates you consume are from a relatively healthful source&#8211;think quinoa or other ancient grains&#8211;these foods still trigger the release of higher levels of insulin than any other macronutrient, so they wreak havoc on blood sugar levels. The exact metabolic impact of carbohydrates varies by person, but the latest scientific research continues to support the notion that most Americans would be well-served to reduce carbohydrate intake. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">While it’s a complex pathway, the keto flu is largely driven by two forces unique to the ketogenic diet: a reduction in overall electrolyte intake and the diuretic nature of the diet. As mentioned above, most people consume more carbs by calorie content than any other macronutrient, and most of those carbs come from low-quality, processed sources. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Ironically, when we remove these foods from our diet, we actually precipitously decrease our overall sodium intake. And since sodium is an electrolyte, this can lead very quickly to an electrolyte deficiency and trigger the keto flu. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Second, as you cut carbohydrates out of your diet and move your body towards ketosis, insulin levels drop, signaling the kidneys to release water and vital electrolytes like sodium and potassium. This molecular pathway is what makes the ketogenic diet diuretic in nature; the sudden drop in insulin triggers the kidneys to release water and electrolytes through increased urine production. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">While the keto flu is a completely normal reaction to the ketogenic diet, there are long-term risks to not addressing the condition. In all likelihood, symptoms will persist until you address them, so they could last over the entire life of the ketogenic diet if you don’t take action. Sounds miserable! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The keto flu can also lead to sleep disturbances and an elevated heart rate, which is a side effect of your body’s attempts to retain sodium through the release of adrenal hormones. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Finally, if left untreated for a long period of time, the keto flu could lead to bone mineral loss or osteoporosis. Our bones are one of the core areas where we store sodium and, if the keto flu is left unchecked, your body could start to leach calcium, along with sodium, from your bones. </span></p>
<h4 class="p4"><span class="s1">Risks of Electrolyte Deficiency on a Ketogenic Diet</span></h4>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5"><span class="s1">Sleep disturbances</span></li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s1">Elevated heart rate</span></li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s1">Mineral loss</span></li>
<li class="li5"><span class="s1">Osteoporosis</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the keto flu is the body’s natural reaction to a ketogenic diet, suffering from it is not a foregone conclusion. You can dramatically reduce the symptoms of the keto flu—or even avoid them altogether—by properly supplementing your electrolytes as you transition into ketosis. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you find yourself to be especially sensitive to the ketogenic diet, you can also ease your transition into ketosis by slowly reducing carbohydrates rather than going cold turkey on day one.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">Remedies for the Keto Flu</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Replacing the electrolytes your body has lost is the single most important thing you can do to combat or prevent the symptoms of the keto flu. This means ensuring you consume adequate levels of sodium, potassium, and magnesium either from food sources or through supplementation. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">We will address exactly what we mean by “adequate levels” in a moment, but for now, we’d like to propose some simple ways to increase your intake of electrolytes:</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">1. Salt Your Food</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Salt your food. Even if it feels weird or gustatorily challenging to salt a salad, try it. It’s critically important that you increase salt consumption on the ketogenic diet, as most of the foods on the menu will not have naturally-occurring sodium at adequate levels. Any kind of table salt will do, but if you have a personal preference for one type over the other, no problem! Just salt your food. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, it’s also important to remember that sodium is not the only electrolyte that needs to be kept in balance on a ketogenic diet. Magnesium and potassium are both critically important electrolytes that we should pay attention to as well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, a well-formulated ketogenic diet that is high in healthful fats and plant-based foods often provides enough of these two electrolytes. Specifically, magnesium can be derived from avocados, almonds, bananas, and leafy greens, while sweet potatoes, spinach, butternut squash, and beets are all great sources of potassium. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Consume Bone Broth</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">There is a robust body of scientific research that has identified bone broth as an incredibly healthy, nutrient-packed superfood. Bone broth is made by simmering the bones and connective tissues of an animal for a long period of time—generally between ten and twenty hours—which is what separates it from the standard broth or stock found in most grocery stores. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Cooking for such an extended period of time allows the broth to absorb the collagen, glutamine, and other minerals that give bone broth its rich nutrient density that is commonly touted for its benefits for the gut, joints, skin, and overall health.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Furthermore, while bone broth is a decent source of sodium on its own, it’s very easy (and recommended) to add salt or a bouillon cube to turn it into a keto flu-busting intervention.</span></p>
<h4 class="p5"><span class="s1">3. Make Electrolyte Homebrews</span></h4>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You should </span><span class="s3">never</span><span class="s1"> turn to sugary sports drinks to combat the keto flu. Unfortunately, all of the traditional electrolyte products on the market have insufficient levels of actual electrolytes and are very high in sugar. This sudden burst of electrolyte-less sugar will spike insulin levels and derail your path to ketogenesis. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Despite their catchy marketing campaigns, endorsement deals with famous athletes, and sponsorships of virtually every visible sporting event, these drinks are not your friend and should be avoided regardless of whether or not you adhere to a ketogenic diet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is why I spent years mixing up homebrew concoctions with ingredients from my own pantry. With some trial and error, I was able to design a few <a href="https://bit.ly/2JYJSOF?utm_source=RobbWolf&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=KETO_FLU"><span class="s4">great do-it-yourself drink recipes</span></a> for those who are more inclined to mix up their own keto flu-killing concoctions. If you’d like to give some of these a try, you can see a list of my favorite recipes <a href="https://bit.ly/2JYJSOF?utm_source=RobbWolf&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=KETO_FLU"><span class="s4">here</span></a>.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">Drink LMNT Recharge</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After years of tinkering with homebrew recipes—some of which were way off the mark!—and waiting for someone to develop and release an electrolyte product that wasn’t bathed in sugar, I finally decided to do something about this problem. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thus was born LMNT Recharge, a product that I specifically formulated to help replenish the body’s electrolytes in the initial phase of the ketogenic diet. It’s a tasty electrolyte mix filled with everything you need and nothing you don&#8217;t—namely, sugar.</span></p>

<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1">How Much Sodium Is Too Much Sodium?</span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">For the last three decades, we’ve all been told that we need to reduce sodium intake to control blood pressure, and current recommendations call for 1.5 to 2.3 grams of sodium per day. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">However, a 2011 study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110105"><span class="s4">published</span></a> in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> painted a much different picture of sodium consumption. This study, which sought to correlate sodium intake with cardiovascular incidents like strokes and heart attacks, found that the lowest rate of these events actually occurred in people consuming five<i> </i>grams of sodium per day. That’s more than double the recommended daily intake! </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Furthermore, an individual had to consumer <b><i>eight </i></b>grams of sodium per day to reach the same problematic levels of cardiovascular events as those people consuming less than 2 grams of sodium per day.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110105"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20873 size-large" src="http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-10.20.46-AM-800x712.png" alt="" width="740" height="659" srcset="http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-10.20.46-AM-800x712.png 800w, http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-10.20.46-AM-235x209.png 235w, http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-10.20.46-AM-768x684.png 768w, http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-05-at-10.20.46-AM.png 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a><span class="s1">Another <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317099.php"><span class="s2">study</span></a> published in <i>Preventive Medicine </i>found that individuals who restricted sodium intake to less than 2.5 grams per day actually had<i> </i>a<i> higher </i>blood pressure than those who consumed more, further disproving the deep-seated notion that high levels of sodium intake are bad for cardiovascular health.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An individual’s level of optimal sodium intake is a multifactorial question, depending on their age, body mass, their level of activity, and even the region of the world where they live. Without prescribing generic ranges, I think we can undoubtedly say that increasing sodium intake, especially in people who are adhering to a ketogenic diet, is perfectly safe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The keto flu is an unfortunate side effect of cutting carbohydrates and transitioning your body’s primary fuel source from glucose to ketones. However, it should not deter you from giving this revolutionary diet a try. Your body is perfectly capable of using ketones for fuel, as is the goal of a ketogenic diet, but years of dependence on carbohydrates has forced your body to “forget” how to power itself with fat. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You simply have to give your body time to relearn this natural process. Furthermore, balancing your electrolytes, especially in the early days of your transition into ketosis, will boost your energy levels, eliminate keto leg cramps, and enhance performance and recovery. With an understanding of what the keto flu is and how to prevent and combat its symptoms, we think you will be fully prepared to adapt to this new lifestyle.</span></p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p><b>1. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3VQOO-0Njk">Thoughts On Oxalates? </a></b>[<em>3:02</em>]</p>
<p>Alex says:</p>
<p>What is your perspective on oxalates? Is there any merit to what people like Dr William Shaw, Sally Norton, and Elliot Overton say about the evils of oxalates? or can we all keep eating spinach and almonds? &nbsp;Could this be the explanation as to why some people who go full carnivore benefit from eliminating all greens?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. <a href="https://youtu.be/yRnpLWtMNJI">Living WELL to 100 and Beyond </a></b>[<em>10:05</em>]<b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Paul says:</p>
<p>Robb and Nicki, I am definitely one of the original 6 listeners and credit you many times for changing my life and educating me to the point that I helped other people change their lives. Ok I am 62 in very good shape and have a smoking hot younger wife that I would live to make it to our 50th wedding anniversary, which will make me 107. So the question is what test do I do now to make sure I have the best chance to achieve this goal and hopefully correct if something is wrong now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/PA5jcU_L-xI">Eating For Olympic Weightlifting </a></b>[<em>13:15</em>]<b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Jake says:</p>
<p>Robb,</p>
<p>Thank you for the podcast its great. I know your very busy but I was wondering how you would suggest approaching a healthy diet for olympic weightlifting? I&#8217;m 35, 5ft9in 185lbs and around 18% body fat( this is a rough estimate using ketogains website). I want to compete but not looking to sacrifice my health, and would like to lift into my old age. You mentioned that you competed in powerlifting when you were younger and I thought maybe you would have some insight into the subject. I currently intermittent fast roughly 14hrs everyday. My diet is protein from variety of meats,carbs from lots of fresh veggies, fats from nuts, coconut and olive oil. No sugars unless family holiday. My goal is to lose some body fat but maintain my strength. I tried to go full keto, no carbs, and my strength plummets. Thanks again, sorry for such a long question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. <a href="https://youtu.be/3cJV5xSz4h4">Low Carb &amp; Sleep</a></b> [<em>16:18</em>]<b><br />
</b></p>
<p>Angel says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>Thanks for answering our questions! When I eat low carb, I tend to wake up at 3am and have a hard time falling back asleep. However, if I have some carbs (i.e. a small bowl of rice or a sweet potato) during dinner, I generally sleep through the night and wake up naturally a little after 6am. I usually go to bed around 10pm, and eat dinner around 6pm.</p>
<p>The problem is, when I eat carbs during dinner, I gain weight overtime. Eating low carb helps me lose weight. Is there a reason for the interrupted sleep eating low carb? I searched online and some people say it’s due to noradrenaline. I don’t know what that is and I am wondering how i can improve my sleep while eating low carb? Thank you very much for your knowledge!</p>
<p>Angel</p>

<p>Mike says:</p>
<p>Going back to your first book &#8211; what are the main things you would revise or add &#8211; if you ever did a revision?</p>

Let&#8217;s see, let&#8217;s jump in with our first question from, actually Wade&#8217;s Army, do you want to tell folks about Wade&#8217;s Army?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Oh man, our dear friends John and Kate Welbourn, they had twin girls, seven years ago.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yup.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And the girls were friends with another-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One of Kate&#8217;s really good friends from college.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, well you know this story better than I do.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, one of Kate&#8217;s really good friends from college had a set of boy/girl twins. And the boy, Wade, ended up with neuroblastoma. So they started Wade&#8217;s Army to fundraise and get awareness around neuroblastoma, and it&#8217;s a wonderful wonderful non-profit, and every fall they do a big fundraiser and workout.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And the neuroblastoma people are pretty cool. When I was first approached to help with this I wrote a bit of a critical email saying that not enough effort is put into prevention and investigation of alternative therapies like hyperbaric oxygen, ketogenic diets and whatnot. And I got an email back from these folks and they said they were wide open as far as diversifying what they looked at, all that they were interested in was moving the ball forward on this stuff. So they appear to be really wonderful people, even at that neuroblastoma research side of the story.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then John and Kate are super passionate about it.

Okay, we&#8217;ll jump into our first question from Alex on oxalates. &#8220;Rob, what is your perspective on oxalates, is there any merit to what people like Dr. Williams Shaw, Sally Norton and Elliot Overton say about the evils of oxalates, or can we all keep eating spinach and almonds? Could this be the explanation as to why some people who go full carnivore benefit from eliminating all greens?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So maybe the easiest thing to answer there is the last point, yeah this is almost certainly one of the reasons why folks that go full carnivore finally address that niggling underlying issue that keto and paleo, although benefiting sometimes to some degree, doesn&#8217;t fully resolve. And it&#8217;s interesting, you could make the case that we should be able to handle oxalates just fine, and when you look at some of the gut microbiota of the [hudsa 00:03:07], for example, they have oxalate metabolizing bacteria. And then there&#8217;s also issues around adequate calcium intake and can mitigate some of the deleterious effects of oxalate, basically keeping it sequestered in the feces and it moves out instead of getting moved in.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But the results are the reality that we should have bacteria that can help us deal with oxalates. Generally in westernized populations we don&#8217;t. And this is some of the conundrum that I think we face at large is, whatever reason, the way that our westernized diet is altering the gut microbiota, we are losing the ability to deal with more and more foods. And to some degree like keto, low carb, zero carb, carnivore, it&#8217;s kind of like the last spot that people end up that they can still deal with things. And it seems like fruits to some degree is less of a problem. Some things like white rice or different starchy components may be for different people are less problematic. Mushrooms may be less problematic.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But a lot of these things that are historically thought of as being health foods and super foods like spinach and kale and all that stuff, they really cause a lot of problems for some people. And it&#8217;s interesting again when we think about this from the evidence-based nutrition folks and it fits your macros folks, or what have you. We really should be able to deal with this stuff better than what we do. Nobody, as far as I can tell right now, is entirely clear about how we can restore the gut microbiota.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I was at the evolutionary medicine conference that [inaudible 00:04:57] puts on each year, and Erika Sonenberg from the Sonenberg Lab at Stanford was there and we were talking about this stuff. And there&#8217;s kind of a reality that when you look at the gut microbiota over generations, and they&#8217;ve done this in mice and we&#8217;ve also seen this in humans. It&#8217;s getting more and more narrow as time goes on, which is not good. It&#8217;s a multi generational problem. This is the point that I wanted to make about the, it fits your macros folks and some of the evidence-based nutrition folks, is that it appears that any inclusion of westernized foods begins and accelerates the loss of gut microbiotic diversity.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So this whole notion that you can have a little bit here and there, maybe a fucking lie, or it may be completely misinformed, ill informed if we&#8217;re thinking about the gut microbiota as like this extra genomic information processing center where we&#8217;ve got more genetic diversity in our gut than we have in the totality of humanity. And that stuff is being lost over time, and there&#8217;s a case to be made that no amount of westernized foods are really safe in this regard. I&#8217;m not stating this as fact, I&#8217;m stating this as a little bit of a hypothesis. But if the hypothesis is true, that the inclusion of virtually any amount of westernized foods starts moving us in a direction of a more curtailed gut microbiota, then what the fuck are we going to do about that?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And how are people going to modify their recommendations according to that information? And again, the information that comes out of the Sonenberg Lab is very interesting in this regard, and there&#8217;s definitely a lot of people that, myself included, like somebody held my feet to the fire about all the almonds I was eating. And fucking lo and behold man, I think some of the final kind of gut related stuff that I had was from eating these nuts. And I&#8217;ve tinkered with soaking and sprouting and getting the ghost of [inaudible 00:07:10] priced to lay hands on my sprouted fucking stuff. And it&#8217;s better, but it&#8217;s not great. Like I do better without them.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And so I&#8217;m kind of in this mode of carnivore plus coffee and fermented food. It&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m at and doing really well with that. Like I feel really good, my digestion is good. But it&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve shifted to a more curtailed, less diverse food intake, but I feel better. But then there&#8217;s an argument to be made that I&#8217;m probably tuning my gut microbiota to a more narrow frequency band, but I&#8217;m just stuck at this point. I don&#8217;t know what else to do, I&#8217;ve done like every probiotic prebiotic. I won&#8217;t name any of them because I don&#8217;t want to throw them under the bus, because it didn&#8217;t work for me doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t work for someone else.</span></span></span></p>

And I know I&#8217;m getting totally out in the weeds here, but on the one hand I think that we have people maybe in the ancestral health scene, some people that sell a degree of knowledge on this topic that is bullshit. Like they can claim this kind of magic divination that oh if you have this profile then you need to do X, Y, Z. And I think that that&#8217;s horse shit. But then on the flip side I think that the evidence-based nutrition folks are dismissive of this topic to the point of eventual legal ramifications or something. Just moral ramifications if nothing else. Like they too approach this story with this remarkable degree of certitude when it&#8217;s a brand new topic, there&#8217;s so much more that we don&#8217;t know than what we do know.</span></span></span></p>

And then we start trying to iterate and move from there. That was a short question with a very very very very very long answer.</span></span></span></p>

Our next question is from Paul on living well to 100 and beyond. &#8220;Robb and Nicki, I&#8217;m definitely one of the original six listeners and credit you many times for changing my life and educating me to the point that I helped other people change their lives. Okay, I&#8217;m 62, in very good shape, and have a smoking hot younger wife that I would love to make it to our 50th wedding anniversary, which would make me 107. So the question is, what test do I do now to make sure I have the best chance to achieve this goal and hopefully correct it if something is wrong?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Man.

Singular test. So I could make a case for the whole LPRI score, to look at where one&#8217;s insulin resistance versus sensitivity metabolic health, metabolic flexibility. It also gives you insight into systemic inflammation, mainly from GlycA and a couple of other elements in there. So this is something we use in the advanced testing within the clinic here in Reno. It&#8217;s incredibly valuable for being able to assign kind of a metabolic risk number on folks. And if we get an improvement &#8230; Let&#8217;s say the higher the number the kind of worse things are.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If somebody does the LPRI score and they get a number of 85, and we move them to a 45, almost from like a life insurance actuarial table perspective, we can assign a risk mitigation based off that change, which is basically the underpinning of most of the work that we&#8217;ve done. So as an external test that LPRI score I think could be really really valuable for establishing a baseline and trying to track that over time.</span></span></span></p>

Yeah. And some of these benchmarks of a double body weight deadlift. A body weight and a half back squat, body weight and some change bench. Maybe a body weight standing press. Your weight plus 50 to 72% of your weight in a weighted chin or pull-up. Maintaining muscle mass and then maintaining some degree of metabolic engine both in the aerobic and the anaerobic areas, I think is about as good a bet is what you&#8217;re going to get with that as far as some reasonably objective measures that would correlate with effective aging.</span></span></span></p>

Like I used to be a little bit of a fan of looking at telomeres length and then some recent research that I read really poured some cold water down my back on that one.

I know you&#8217;re very busy, but I was wondering how you would suggest approaching a healthy diet for Olympic weightlifting? I&#8217;m 35, 5&#8217;9&#8243;, 185 pounds, and around 18% body fat. This is a rough estimate using the keto gains website. I want to compete but not looking to sacrifice my health and would like to lift into my old age. You mentioned that you competed in power lifting when you were younger, and I thought maybe you would have some insight into the subject. I currently intermittent fast roughly 14 hours every day, my diet is protein from a variety of meats, carbs from lots of fresh veggies, fats from nuts, coconut and olive oil. No sugars unless family holiday. My goal is to lose some body fat but maintain my strength. I tried to go full keto, no carbs, and my strength plummets. Thanks again, sorry for such a long question.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>

There is a reality that the first-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well and he said, no carbs too, so there&#8217;s also he could potentially have some carbs post training.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. I think there&#8217;s different ways of skinning that for sure. One thing is if you do go keto, you got to be very aggressive in supplementing electrolytes in particular, sodium. Beyond that, but keto is by no means the only route to losing body fat. And so you could still use the keto gains macro nutrient calculator to help you establish a baseline of caloric intake, and then you just tweak it a little bit. Like if you make sure that you do the keto gains recommended protein intake which is about a gram, gram and a half of protein per pound lean body mass. And then it&#8217;s going to make a recommendation around your carbs and fat. The carbs are going to be set automatically at about 25 grams per day. If you want to add &#8230; Let&#8217;s say you want to run 100 grams of carbs a day, so you&#8217;re going to add 75 grams of carbs, you&#8217;re going to delete approximately about 30 grams of fat.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Like you could do the numbers on that, but that&#8217;s kind of the approximate ballpark on that. In that way you&#8217;ve got to really slick way of quickly figuring out what a recommended caloric intake is, make sure you&#8217;re benchmarked on your protein, and then just adjust the carbs and fat appropriate to what you&#8217;re doing. And you would still probably benefit from an eye towards proper electrolyte supplementation.</span></span></span></p>

Thanks Jake, our next question is on low carb and sleep from Angel. &#8220;Hi Robb, thanks for answering our questions. When I eat low carb I tend to wake up at 3 am and have a hard time falling back asleep. However, if I have some carbs, like a small bowel of rice or a sweet potato during dinner I generally sleep through the night and wake up naturally a little after 6 am. I usually go to bed around 10 pm and eat dinner around 6 pm. The problem is, when I eat carbs during dinner I gain weight over time.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Overtime, or over time? I don&#8217;t know. &#8220;Eating low carb helps me lose weight. Is there a reason for the interrupted sleep while eating low carb? I searched online and some people say it&#8217;s due to noradrenaline, I don&#8217;t know what that is and I&#8217;m wondering how I can improve my sleep while eating low carb. Thank you very much for your knowledge.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do you want to tackle this one?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I mean the sodium one is the one that&#8217;s popping out for me.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, for sure. When folks shift lower carb even from basic paleo type carb levels they definitely notice an increase in adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, these hormones are being released kind of in a compensatory effort to retain more sodium. It&#8217;s kind of an indirect work around, but it&#8217;s registering as a stress. The low sodium environment, there&#8217;s a downward spiral where you shed sodium, then you shed potassium, and then all hell kind of breaks loose. And so this is another scenario where really being on point with electrolytes is critical and you have to hit that at least five grams of sodium plus the potassium and magnesium each day.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">What we find though is that if folks are generally eating a whole food based diet, then you pretty well on magnesium and potassium. They might need a little bit of supplemental help there. But they&#8217;re really deficient in the sodium. And so this is one of these things that just, it&#8217;s like magic. If you are staying on point with the electrolyte supplementation, you either do bouillon, you do a home brew, or you get something like Element and it fixes this problem remarkably quickly.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay, final question for this week is from Mike on the paleo diet. Mike says, &#8220;Going back to your first book, what are the main things you would revise or add if you ever did a revision?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well the funny thing is we did do a revision. There is a volume two-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The paperback.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Just updated slightly.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I mean there wasn&#8217;t a massive amount that we tweaked. So I had some pretty aggressive fish oil recommendations in the first book, which I modified over time. Thank you for the people that burned me at the stake about getting that one wrong, I was largely following people like Barry Sears and other folks, that information seemed credible at the time. On that fatty acid&#8230;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The omega three profile in grass fed beef?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. So to that fatty acid topic, Diana Rogers and I had been working on this sustainability book and movie called Sacred Cow. And it&#8217;s interesting because we&#8217;ve had pretty massive pushback from the vegan community. The vegans. Which is not surprising at all, but I tell you one of the more surprising places that we get a shocking degree of pushback, and very vigorous and very ill informed unfortunately, is the really go getter paleo ancestral health crowd that insist that grass fed meat is the only grass fed, grass finish is the only way to go.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And Diana and I tackle this in the book and we&#8217;re also going to be doing a series of blog posts and other support material where I really dig into the literature on this. But the reality is that, so as a baseline, the bulk of ruminant animals, whether it&#8217;s cows, sheep, goats, camel, whatever. They&#8217;re grass fed for the most part, there is some grain finishing. Now, the thing is, is that I probably am suffer &#8230; What do they say, like when you raise kids like you get back what you were&#8230;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You get back what you put out as a kid.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">-as a kid. And so I&#8217;m sure I sowed a lot of the seeds of my frustration on this now. Because early in the story there was a sense that the fanning acid profiles of grass fed meat were remarkably better with regards to the omega three, omega six balance than grain finished meat. Around 2009, 2010 though, Mat LaLonde really did the deep dive into this stuff, and he was like, no man that&#8217;s not the case at all. There&#8217;s very little difference when you get right down to it.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And I got into a pissing match on the interwebs, on social media, shocker, with a woman who is a master&#8217;s degree in chemical engineering, and she insisted that there was a difference in the protein.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Grass fed vs grain fed.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Of grass fed versus grain finished meat. And I said, show me one paper. And she went through all of this magic and mysticism and flailing and all kinds of appeal to odd authorities, but could not produce one thing that suggested that the protein content, nor really the fatty acid content was significantly different between grass finished and grain finished meat.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now from a sustainability perspective, there&#8217;s a great argument for doing as much grass finishing as possible, but even in that story, there&#8217;s a reality that to the degree that we do continue to grow wheat or corn or rice or whatever, the leftovers in that scenario is not technically grass, but it is something that animals can be finished on. And it is used that way, and it&#8217;s a very smart utilization of resources because otherwise that is cellulosic material just builds up and it degrades very slowly. It maybe oxidizes instead of composts and all that type of stuff.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So there&#8217;s really compelling reasons to have a middle ground in this story, and not be complete zealots about it. There is no compelling case from a health perspective that the fatty acid profiles are different. And so that&#8217;s a big one from the book that I probably sowed a lot of erroneous information really advocating for grass fed meant, but the reason why I&#8217;ve been advocating for grass fed meat, even with the knowledge about there&#8217;s not that big of a difference from the health perspective. There is a significant story there from a resource management sustainability perspective.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So that&#8217;s going to be a fun one to unpack over the next 10 years.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So the fish oil, the fatty acid profile in grass finish versus grain finished beef. Anything else?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">No, otherwise, paleo solution was pretty on point. You know, making recommendations around sleep, getting out in the sun, lifting some weights, doing some sprinting, not letting your internal dialogue eat you up, that whole the stress chapter. Like the finance piece and everything. So that stuff&#8217;s kind of stood the test of time, and honestly got recycled and updated significantly in Wired to Eat. Like it&#8217;s still those things are kind of &#8230; I would argue kind of universalities in this story, yeah.</span></span></span></p>

<p><b>1.<a href="https://youtu.be/XMGVm2I_o_Q"> In &amp; Out of Ketosis&#8230;Harmful?</a> </b>[2:10]</p>
<p>Pete says:</p>
<p>Robb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on and off a keto diet for the past five years or so and when in Ketosis feel fantastic. &nbsp;I train muay thai and on days that I train I tend to up my carb intake as I just feel better throughout training, similar to you with jiu jitsu. &nbsp;On Sundays however I do tend to go off the rails a bit and find myself on Monday down around the 0.2 mmol/L level and then by Tuesday night/Wednesday morning back up any where between 1.0-2.4 mmol/L where I stay for the rest of the week. &nbsp;I have in the past gone several months at a time on a 30-50g carb per day diet on multiple occasions, haven&#8217;t done so the past year and half or so. I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot lately that this quick fluctuation between low carb to moderate/high carb intake can be very bad for you. &nbsp;Can you help shed some light on this, am I doing long term damage to my body by fluctuating?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pete</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. <a href="https://youtu.be/vlnxFI1IThc">Eating Below My BMR</a> </b>[10:48]</p>
<p>Chris says:</p>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Over the past 7 months, I&#8217;ve had great success following the Keto Masterclass. &nbsp;As far as weight-loss goes, I&#8217;ve lost about 42 lbs, and lowered my BF% from about 28% to about 19%. For the first 12 weeks, I ate at a 20% deficit, without a break. I weighed and measured all my food. I made sure I had my electrolytes dialed in, eating lots of potassium and magnesium rich foods, supplementing Na+ as well as Mg+ too. During that time, I was lifting 4x per week as well as a couple (15-20 min) interval workouts per week. &nbsp;Other than that, I was doing some light walking and playing with my kids.</p>
<p>Towards the end of that initial run, I started to get kind of bitchy (I&#8217;m a 45-year old male), and never really experienced the stable energy, or deep, solid sleep that a lot of people mention &#8211; two things I was really hoping for.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been alternating 4-week cuts, followed with 2-week &#8220;full diet breaks&#8221; (a&#8217;la Lyle McDonald) at maintenance. During those, carb sources have been clean, paleo foods. Coming off of each of these, I feel better and maintained a stable weight throughout. &nbsp;I was normally back in ketosis 48-72 hours after switching my carb and fat macros back up, and both times (so far) it has restarted weight loss. Still not great sleep, but I attribute that to having young kids (2 &amp; 6).</p>
<p>After a recent DEXA scan, I was recalculating my macros with the Ketogains calculator (I&#8217;m 162# and 19% BF), and it dawned on me that the deficit it was recommending (-15%) was put me BELOW my Basal Metabolic Rate by about 105 calories, per day. &nbsp;For reference, I used the &#8220;sedentary&#8221; activity level and don&#8217;t add back in workout calories.</p>
<p>So, to my question(s)&#8230;</p>
<p>Understanding that the calculator is based off the Katch-McCardle formula, basically giving a statistical norm, but BMR is the calories we need to maintain vital physiological functions, what are your thoughts on recommended deficits putting one below their BMR and what are the longer-term implications of extended diets doing so? &nbsp;Would it be better to just eat AT BMR on rest days and add back in some (all? a portion?) workout calories (protein &amp; fat) on training days, while still being below TDEE?</p>
<p>It seems to me that BMR should be an absolute floor when it comes to caloric intake &#8211; I&#8217;m wondering if the aggressive deficits created some diet fatigue and hormonal disruption for me.</p>
<p>Love the podcast and anything the Wolf Pack puts out. &nbsp;Thanks for everything!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/5JhA1U9BZss">Do Calories Matter?</a> </b>[19:58]</p>
<p>Zach says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb-</p>
<p>Long time follower and really appreciate the work you&#8217;re doing. I wish I had known about Keto and Paleo when I was younger; I feel my athletic performance could have propelled me to the next level. Either way, I&#8217;m happy to have it in my life today as it keeps me thin and healthy. Your Keto Masterclass has been instrumental in guiding me through my Keto/Paleo journey. Thank you!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been very interested in the low carb diet for 10+ years now and it started with Gary Taubes. Gary Taubes is famous for saying that calories don&#8217;t count and in my anecdotal experience, they don&#8217;t. I must stress that since it works for me, I&#8217;m completely happy with the results. However, when trying to speak intelligently about Keto and low carb, I&#8217;m trying to bridge a gap from Gary to Chris Kresser&#8217;s podcast with Joe Rogan last week. On Joe Rogan Chris said that you *must* run a caloric deficit to lose weight. Now I am really confused!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an engineer and I&#8217;ve taken several thermodynamics courses, so from an energy balance equation I understand that the human body cannot defy thermodynamic principles. But obviously our metabolism is much more complex than an energy in- energy out black box. Furthermore, energy in-energy out does not feel right for a number of reasons such as, for instance, energy expended drinking cold water is not in this equation (that is your body warming the cold water up), energy that is never consumed but rather part of a &#8220;defecation event&#8221;, etc. I have eaten what I perceived to be a major energy surplus on a ketogenic diet and have still lost weight. My caveat there is that I wasn&#8217;t weighing foods, so I cannot really know.</p>
<p>My apologies if you&#8217;ve already answered this question, but I could not find it on your blog or searching your website. I&#8217;m hoping you can point me to a study, a white paper, a text or some reliable information that will answer the question of who&#8217;s right- Gary Taubes or Chris Kresser.</p>
<p>Thanks Robb, you&#8217;re a legend.</p>

<p>Andrea says:</p>
<p>Hi kids and kitties and Squatchys!</p>
<p>Sooooo, it&#8217;s been a little while since I have been devouring each and every single podcast episode and I apologize. My own business focus has put me more into the writing podcast genre recently (but I see Tim Grahl on your interviewee list!?). <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So, my question: have you guys laid out a protocol for extreme nutrient buildup for before and after a scheduled surgery? This would be for someone who is not really paleo: still eats gluten and mostly just avoids sugar and junky foods. So they are not yet on the &#8220;rawr sardines nom nom!&#8221; bandwagon, sadly.</p>
<p>But if they have a willingness to make some changes to ensure they are in a better place to prepare to recover from their surgery (jaw replacement, if it matters), what would you &#8216;prescribe&#8217; to them? I&#8217;m family, so if this guidance comes from an outside authority that could make the critical difference in their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>P.S. Love to all you guys. You&#8217;re doing the &#8216;chop the wood, carry the water&#8217; and have been for SO LONG I bow in respect. Hope to see you again soon at some rando paleo conference.</p>

<p>Matt says:</p>
<p>Robb and Nikki thanks for all that you do. You, your books and podcasts have changed my life. I have done two days a week of CrossFit for just over 2 years and in spite of the amount of rest I get I still end up with knee, shoulder, wrist and elbow injuries and pain. I have recently decided to pause my CrossFit subscription and have replaced it with the three days a week 5 by 5 routine recommended by the ketogains guys. I did your <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">keto masterclass</a> and I&#8217;m at 7.5% body fat and try to keep my macros on point with the ketogains recommendations. What do you think about just doing the 5&#215;5 home workout alone? I do like the group element of the CrossFit class but at my age (52) I can&#8217;t seem to go for long without injury or constant pain. I feel like the 5&#215;5 program at home is more manageable as I can control the velocity/intensity without so much emotional effort. &nbsp;What are your thoughts regarding this path?</p>

I need to go over here. Questions. Okay, our first question is from Pete on going in and out of ketosis. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;Hey Robb, I&#8217;ve been on and off a keto diet for the past five years or so, and when in ketosis I feel fantastic. I train Muay Thai, and on days that I train, I tend to up my carb intake as I just feel better throughout training, similar to you with Jiu Jitsu. On Sundays, however, I do tend to go off the rails a bit, and find myself on Monday down around the 0.2 mmol/L level, and then by Tuesday night, Wednesday morning back up to anywhere between 1.0 to 2.4 mmol/L, where I stay for the rest of the week. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I have in the past gone several months at a time on a 30 to 50 gram carb per day diet on multiple occasions, haven&#8217;t done so in the past year and a half or so. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot lately that this quick fluctuation between low carb to moderate high carb intake can be very bad for you. Can you help shed some light on this? </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Am I doing long-term damage to my body by fluctuating?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s a really good question. There have been some studies recently, Bill Lagako&#8217;s posted a few of these where people on the ketogenic diet &#8230; And, you know, I can&#8217;t remember if it was actually human study or animal study. I&#8217;ll have to dig around on that. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But basically they had a keto-adapted organism, either human or rodent, given some carbs. Blood glucose levels went quite high, high enough that you would anticipate some damage to the vascular endothelium. And so the thought there was, low carb diets are dangerous because when people deviate off the low carb diet then there&#8217;s problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And we definitely know that in the low carb state, people become physiologically insulin-resistant, or have a tendency to become physiologically insulin-resistant. What that means is, in general, the muscles and the adipose tissue don&#8217;t really take up as much glucose as what they did previously, and the glucose is being spared for the brain and the red blood cells and the tissues that really have to have glucose. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But in the context of something like this, the way that Tyler and Louise have recommended for keto gains and whatnot, a low glycemic load titration up in carbohydrates seems to be totally benign. Doing the targeted approach, in which you&#8217;re putting 10, 15 grams of glucose into the mix immediately pre-training, we really don&#8217;t have good studies on that. But I can&#8217;t imagine that that is a net negative. Particularly when I see how well people perform on that, and they feel good.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Does it have more to do with how his blood glucose is responding when he jumps to high carb? Because it seems like, with the metabolic flexibility stuff, one who is metabolically flexible should be able to go from one to the other, so-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You should, and the thing is, we&#8217;re only seeing ketone levels here, we&#8217;re not really seeing his blood glucose levels.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But I guess my question is what he&#8217;s at. Is this deviation that he&#8217;s saying could be dangerous, is that if the person&#8217;s blood glucose levels skyrocket?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yes. That&#8217;s where the concern is. And we just don&#8217;t have enough information here to really know what&#8217;s going on. You know, this is one of those tough things though, where is going on a complete hookers and cocaine carb binge while keto adapted a bad thing? Yeah. Is going on a complete hookers and cocaine carb binge a bad thing under-</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Any meal causes a disruption in vascular endothelial function. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This is why we shouldn&#8217;t fucking graze all day, and we should eat a meal here, a meal there, and then have periods of time where we&#8217;re not putting calories into our system. Because every time you eat, there&#8217;s a systemic inflammatory response, you get a little bit of lipopolysaccharide that goes through the gut barrier into systemic circulation.</span></span></span></p>

I&#8217;m tired enough right now, that Nicki nearly got a spinning elbow off of that one. Yeah, of course, plants only don&#8217;t cause any of these problems. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But this is where &#8230; And this is something, actually, now I&#8217;m thinking about it, would be worthwhile to look at what&#8217;s the disruption in endothelial function when somebody&#8217;s low carb and each a carb rich real, versus just Joe Schmo is motoring along and then they eat a carb and/or a fat rich meal, and see what the vascular endothelial dysfunction is in that scenario.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This stuff, again, also it boils down to: are you overeating, both in amount and frequency? </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This is some stuff that&#8217;s also really interesting, where they took people who were caloric restricted, and relatively few meals, like two or three, or calorie restricted and six or eight meals a day. And the calorie restricted plus six or eight meals per day had no real benefit with regards to systemic inflammatory function and a bunch of other biomarkers of aging and inflammation. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So eating too frequently is a problem, even when we add in calorie restriction. So you can completely undo that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So man, I don&#8217;t know. It makes a case for just not being an asshole with your food. If you&#8217;re kind of eating low carb, kind of stick with low carb. And particularly in this day and age, if you want some ice cream, get some Mammoth Creamery or some Killer Whey low-carb ice cream. If you want some cookies, get some Nui cookies or something. If you&#8217;re generally eating low carb, then generally figure out a fucking way to eat low carb. If you&#8217;re not, then kind of work within that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But I do think it&#8217;s a really good question. Pete raises a great question. And I don&#8217;t think we have remotely all the answers on this. There&#8217;s a lot of moving parts to it. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But it is just kind of a reality. If we don&#8217;t overeat, if we not eating at a ridiculous meal frequency, which ironically two or three meals per day seems to be a reasonable meal frequency, and you&#8217;re getting enough [inaudible 00:08:04] activation that you don&#8217;t totally wither away all your muscle mass and die from Sarcopenia, but you also are not eating so frequently that we&#8217;re getting a real, legit, upregulation systemic inflammatory signaling and whatnot.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, Pete, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve really answered your question there, but there&#8217;s a lot going on with this.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And also, how far off the rails are you going? Are you doing 800 grams of carbs, or are you doing 200? I think that can play into it too.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And if it&#8217;s post workout or something, it&#8217;s a really different story. Our weeks tend to be a little bit more sedentary on the front end. We&#8217;re not even really making it to formal Jiu Jitsu class on Tuesday, Thursdays right now because of workload. We&#8217;re lucky if we go out in the garage and do a little bit of drilling. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So on the front end of the week, I&#8217;m not really eating much in the way of carbs. Whereas Friday and Saturday, those tend to be bigger training days, and so I&#8217;ll have a couple of oranges for breakfast in addition to all my other stuff.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then we&#8217;ll do Jiu Jitsu, and then based off of how knackered I am from that Jiu Jitsu training session, I may do &#8230; So the two oranges are 40 grams of carbs alone, and then after that I may have the equivalent of three or four more oranges. So I end up with that 100 to 120 grams per day of carbohydrate, but I feel good with that. I don&#8217;t get a crazy blood sugar crash. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m not tracking ketones, but I just kind of dose it appropriate to my activity level. Whereas if I&#8217;m just sitting working, I don&#8217;t need it. I just don&#8217;t need it. I don&#8217;t need that many calories; I don&#8217;t need that many carbs. And so I just don&#8217;t throw it in.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So to your point, there&#8217;s a lot of mitigating strategies that can be employed, like exercise and meal timing and stuff like that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay. Our next question is from Chris, about deficits below basal metabolic rate. &#8220;Hey guys, over the past seven months I&#8217;ve had great success following the keto masterclass. As far as weight loss goes, I&#8217;ve lost 42 pounds, lowered my body fat percentage from around 28% to about 19%. For the first 12 weeks I ate at a 20% deficit without a break. I weighed and measured all my food, and I made sure I had my electrolytes dialed in: eating lots of potassium- and magnesium-rich foods, supplementing sodium as well as magnesium too.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;During that time, I was lifting four times per week, as well as a couple of 15 to 20 minute interval workouts per week. Other than that, I was doing some light walking and playing with my kids. Towards the end of that initial run, I started to get kind of bitchy. I&#8217;m a 45 year old male, and never really experienced the stable energy or deep solid sleep that a lot of people mention, two things I was really hoping for.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;Recently I&#8217;ve been alternating four-week cuts followed with two-week full diet breaks a la Lyle McDonald at maintenance. During those, carb sources have been clean paleo foods. Coming off of each of these, I feel better and maintained a stable weight throughout. I was normally back in ketosis in 48 to 72 hours after switching my carb and fat macros back up. And both times, so far, it has re-started weight loss. Still not great sleep, but I attribute that to having young kids, two and six.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;After a recent DEXA scan I was recalculating my macros with the keto gains calculator. I&#8217;m 162 pounds and 19% body fat. And it dawned on me that the deficit it was recommending, about 15%, was putting me below my basal metabolic rate by about 105 calories per day. For reference, I use the sedentary activity level, and don&#8217;t add back in workout calories.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;So to my questions. Understanding that the calculator is based off of the Katch-McArdle formula, basically giving a statistical norm, but BMR is the calories we need to maintain vital physiological functions, what are your thoughts on recommended deficits putting one below their BMR, and what are the longer-term implications of extended diets doing so? Would it be better to just eat at BMR on rest days and add back in some I&#8217;ll apportion workout calories on training days while still being below TDEE?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;It seems to me that BMR should be an absolute floor when it comes to caloric intake. I&#8217;m wondering if the aggressive deficit&#8217;s created some diet fatigue and hormonal disruption for me. Love the podcast and anything the Wolf Pack puts out. Thanks for everything.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Man. Really good stuff. We read these ahead of time, we actually do, and I was noodling on how to tackle this one, because it raises a lot of questions and is difficult to really &#8230; </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, we&#8217;ve talked about in the past &#8230; I think we&#8217;ve talked about on here. This is where I&#8217;m feeling like an old man that just tells the same story again and again and again.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, a lot of the questions have similar veins, and so.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">They have similar veins. But also, coming off of FitCon and then paleo effects, I know I told this story several times, and so it&#8217;s not like, okay, I think I&#8217;ve said this, but I can&#8217;t remember. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But anyway, the point being is that I&#8217;ve noticed that I seem to motor along with probably about 20, 25% fewer calories than what you would expect based off weight and activity level and all that type of stuff. Luis has mentioned the same thing. We kind of see it within the Ketogains community.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I remember ages ago, Coach Greg Glassman, founder of CrossFit, we were talking about The Zone, which, interestingly, when you really look at it in its fully formed format, which Barry Sears did a shit job of explaining the athletic interpretation of The Zone, which is about a 60 to 65% fat-fueled diet, mainly from monounsaturated fats, moderate carb, appropriate protein, ironically, I think I end up eating pretty close to what five X fat zone recommendations are, which is fucking ironic, considering all the past and all that stuff around that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But what Greg Glassman mentioned is that when people get in, he called it a thermodynamically efficient state. Which can be all kinds of controversial, and I think we have a question later about the thermodynamics in the story calories in, calories out. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But he just noticed that people seem to motor about 20 to 25% fewer calories than what you would otherwise expect when they&#8217;re eating junk, or maybe not as nutrient-dense. And it&#8217;s interesting, because people freak out about that. There&#8217;s kind of the Ray Peat camp, and there&#8217;s some people that are super geeked out on eating as much as you possibly can short of gaining body weight. And sometimes folks get some decent results off that, maybe they&#8217;ve [inaudible 00:14:53] their hormonal profiles.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But then what&#8217;s always interesting about that, when you dig in, what was their training volume really like? Were they really supplementing sodium in an appropriate way? Were they a night shift worker? There&#8217;s all these moving parts to it that the blame is always placed on the dietary intervention. Which, maybe it was, but there&#8217;s all these other extenuating circumstances that we know can influence this stuff.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chris.</span></span></span></p>

It&#8217;s entirely possible, and I think it&#8217;s reasonable, that when people eat a more nutrient-dense diet they probably require generally fewer calories to get the same processing done. So I don&#8217;t know that this one is really a scenario in which the &#8230; </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">People were surprised by how few calories they eat on keto gains. Again and again people are like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that this is what you guys are recommending.&#8221; But when people get in and actually you relax into the process, then they get great results. We don&#8217;t see thousands and thousands of people with HPTA access dysregulation, because they make sure to stay on point with the protein and with the sodium in particular, and stuff like that.</span></span></span></p>

You have to. And this is Phinney and Volek&#8217;s original work, which gets ignored a lot. They mainly focused on adding bouillon cubes and stuff like that. But they recommended a minimum of five grams per day. And that was just for your run of the mill keto type person, and then you start adding in volume and intensity of training and all these other considerations, then we have some problems there.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So on the one hand, that&#8217;s real popular. But then on the other hand, people are concerned that a nutrient-dense diet may actually be a little more thermodynamically efficient. You just literally may not need quite as much food.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s not saying that in Chris&#8217; scenario he doesn&#8217;t necessarily need a few more calories. But if the goal is still leaning out, we still need a caloric deficit, and you&#8217;ve got to get that by hook or by crook. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You could do a more modest caloric deficit; you could do a zig zag pattern, where on training days you do more calories and on non-training days you do fewer. There are ways of breaking that up. But I&#8217;m not as concerned about that as what I was in the past. Particularly if people are on point with electrolytes and the food is nutrient-dense and all that type of stuff.

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s see. Next question is from Zach on energy balance: Gary Taubes versus Chris Kresser. &#8220;Hey Robb, long time follower, and really appreciate the work you&#8217;re doing. I wish I had known about keto and paleo when I was younger. I feel my athletic performance could have propelled me to the next level. Either way, I&#8217;m happy to have it in my life today, as it keeps me thin and healthy. Your keto masterclass has been instrumental in guiding through my keto paleo journey, so thank you.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been very interested in a low carb diet for 10 plus years now, and it started with Gary Taubes. Gary Taubes is famous for saying that calories don&#8217;t count, and in my anecdotal experience, they don&#8217;t. I must stress that since it works for me, I&#8217;m completely happy with the results. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">However, when trying to speak intelligently about keto and low carb, I&#8217;m trying to bridge a gap from Gary to Chris Kresser&#8217;s podcast with Joe Rogan last week. On Joe Rogan, Chris said that you must run a caloric deficit to lose weight. Now I&#8217;m really confused.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;I&#8217;m an engineer and have taken several thermodynamics courses, so from an energy balance equation I understand that the human body cannot deny thermodynamic principles. But obviously our metabolism is much more complex than an energy in, energy out black box. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Furthermore, energy in, energy out does not feel right for a number of reasons, such as, for instance, energy expended drinking cold water is not in this equation. That is, your body warming the cold water up. Energy that is never consumed but rather part of a defecation event, et cetera.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve eaten what I perceive to be a major energy surplus on a ketogenic diet, and have still lost weight. My caveat there is that I wasn&#8217;t weighing food, so I cannot really know. My apologies if you&#8217;ve already answered this question, but I could not find it on your blog or searching your website. I&#8217;m hoping you can point me to a study, a white paper, a text, or some reliable information that will answer the question of who&#8217;s right: Gary Taubes or Chris Kresser? Thanks Robb, you&#8217;re a legend.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Man. So, my initial foray into the whole low carb scene was just prior to Gary&#8217;s first really popular paper, The Soft Science of Dietary Fat, and a couple of other papers. But this was around 2001 that Gary&#8217;s first paper came out. And it was pretty powerful, because it received a lot of attention, a lot of bandwidth. And it was validating for the very nascent and early low carb paleo-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ancestral health.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">-ancestral health scene. There was nobody out there fighting for this or advocating for it. It was really the dark ages of putting these ideas forward. And Gary&#8217;s work was really a beacon of hope. And I&#8217;ve got to say that, for me, having been on a carbohydrate rollercoaster my whole life prior to this, I was kind of lean but not really lean, and then I went low carb, I would just pour olive oil on my food and eat it, and I was skeletor lean. I was also younger, and I was much more active, and there were all these other factors. But I could eat with pretty much reckless abandon and be as lean as I wanted to be, and I had rock solid energy levels.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And I think that that is a not uncommon experience for many people. And this is why part of Gary&#8217;s idea that he threw out there, that it&#8217;s not really the calories, it&#8217;s just the insulin, had some stickiness. Because at a macro level, there were a lot of people that their personal experience matched up with that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then even working with clients, we had clients that would just change the qualitative nature of their food, and they were still eating a Costco container of almonds or cashews or whatever as part of their overall eating strategy, and they were still losing weight relative to what they were doing before. To Zach&#8217;s point, they still may have been introducing some degree of a caloric deficit in this whole thing.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">At the end of the day, there&#8217;s a huge variation, and Zach, you touched on some of these things. Some people absorb more calories out of their diet than other folks do. Just tweaks in the gut microbiome can make people 10, 20% more efficient at harvesting calories out of the food that would otherwise just pass through. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">People with Celiac disease, and this is where the gut microbiome gets really interesting, we&#8217;re always like, &#8220;diversity, diversity, diversity&#8221;, but folks with Celiac disease tend to have a more diverse gut microbiome. And the thought there is it&#8217;s kind of a response to the fact that the person is likely suffering nutrient deficiencies because of the gut damage, and so they&#8217;re trying to prop up the microbial diversity so that there&#8217;s more opportunity to actually harvest nutrients into the gut.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s highly speculative. There&#8217;s not a randomized control trial on this, so clearly the Nortons and Aragons of the world are going to take a shit down the back of the whole notion. But it&#8217;s really interesting. And there&#8217;s a remarkable spread and variation on that side.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There&#8217;s a pretty good spread on just even the way that people manifest calories at the mitochondrial level. I&#8217;ve talked about that in my metabolic flexibility talk, where some people are really jammed up in that kind of carb-dependent mitochondrial complex. And those people, they kind of burn more energy inefficiently. They&#8217;re producing a lot of reactive oxygen species, but it&#8217;s more a more caloric intensive process.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s not necessarily good, though. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I get to eat more food.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, and you&#8217;re aging and oxidizing yourself at a faster rate.&#8221; This is part of the benefit of being metabolically flexible and tending towards fat mobilization and fat utilization as a primary fuel source, going through that mitochondrial complex too, you tend to produce fewer reactive oxygen species. Which is arguably more thermodynamically efficient. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But at the end of the day, the thermodynamics are legit, but what gets lost in this story is: one person&#8217;s thyroid profile is X; another person&#8217;s is Y. And depending on the delta between those, one may be far more efficient with calories than the other one. And there&#8217;s pluses and minuses to both of those stories.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So what&#8217;s unfortunate, in my opinion, with Gary, I really like the guy, I consider him a friend. But he got wrapped around the axle of proving the insulin hypothesis instead of having that be a potentiality. He really linked his whole wagon and existence to proving that. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Versus I suggested ages ago, 10 years ago, when [inaudible 00:26:03] was in its infancy, &#8220;Let&#8217;s focus on the outcomes and the fact that low carb diets really benefit people. And let&#8217;s focus on the outcome driven element instead of being so wed to proving the mechanistic side.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now, I understand the impetus there. In theory, if you can prove mechanism of causation, then we have in theory better control of what&#8217;s going on. But this is just a nearly infinite process. At the end of the day, there&#8217;s huge spectrums in variation. I was on a podcast yesterday where I was talking about this stuff. And just thinking about caffeine metabolism, there are some people that if you give them 100 milligrams of caffeine, in four hours they have metabolized half of it.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Louise.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So the half-life. Louise, for example. There are other people that the half-life for caffeine for them is 30 hours. So we&#8217;ve got nearly a 10 X spread on just the ability to metabolize a common feature of our existence, caffeine. And so we have nearly a 10 X spread. And I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s remotely that big of a spread with regards to the way that calories impact people; but what if it&#8217;s a 2 X spread, or a 25% spread? That ends up manifesting hugely over the course of a 2000 calorie diet. It could be the 400 calories plus or minus one way or the other. And I don&#8217;t know what the real story is there.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But we do know that there&#8217;s massive variation from person to person. And what is the guy&#8217;s name, the Great Randy or whatever? There&#8217;s this guy that&#8217;s had a million dollar offer for people to prove psychic abilities and paranormal stuff, and it&#8217;s been since the mid-80s. And nobody&#8217;s been able to do it. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So far, paranormal shit doesn&#8217;t seem to exist. Everybody has failed to produce it. And so this notion that somehow there&#8217;s a workaround thermodynamics in the body is kind of ridiculous, on the one hand. Or maybe not ridiculous, but it&#8217;s not being supported over the course of time.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But then the thing that I think that it fits your macros, and the evidence-based nutrition folks kind of miss is that the complexity of that thermodynamic story is jaw-droppingly complex. And the fact that people overeat due to complex food combinations and hyper-palatable food, stress, and all this other stuff, kind of gets dismissed, and it&#8217;s not really woven into a holistic approach to helping people manifest change.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I know that was all over the place, Zach. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s a really interesting, big topic. But I would have to say that this is a situation in which Gary, in my opinion, got fooled by an observational element, which is that there are some people that just seem able to eat a ridiculous amount of calories on a low carb or ketogenic diet, and either maintain weight or lose weight. But at the end of the day, Kresser&#8217;s a bit more on point with this stuff, in that you&#8217;ve got to introduce some sort of a caloric deficit to really lean people out.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And we see this on keto all the time, because people will be like, &#8220;Oh, just eat all the fat and you&#8217;ll lose weight.&#8221; And for some people it works, and for other people, they gain weight on keto.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And what we find with that is that the folks that are focusing on fat are under eating protein, and because of the protein leverage hypothesis, we have a decent understanding that if we under eat protein we will be goosed to eat more of whatever is out there in an attempt to get appropriate nutrition. And that could be higher carb or lower carb, but there&#8217;s a reality that if we hit that appropriate protein threshold, then people tend to spontaneously reduce caloric intake. And that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to say on that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Our next question is from Andrea. Has pre- and post-surgery nutrition buildup been covered? She says: &#8220;Hi kids and kiddies and squatchies. So, it&#8217;s been a little while since I have been devouring each and every single podcast episode, and I apologize. My own business focus has put me more into the writing podcast genre recently, but I see Tim [inaudible 00:30:38] on your interview e-list.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;So my question. Have you guys laid out a protocol for extreme nutrient buildup for before and after a scheduled surgery? This would be for someone who is not really paleo, still eats gluten, and mostly just avoids sugar and junky foods. So they are not yet on the &#8220;raar, sardines from Nom Nom bandwagon&#8221;, sadly. But if they have a willingness to make some changes to ensure they are in a better place to prepare to recover from their surgery, jaw replacement if it matters, what would you prescribe to them? And family, so if this guidance comes from an outside authority, that could make the critical difference in their enthusiasm. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">P.S. love to all you guys, you&#8217;re doing the chop wood, carry the water, and have been for so long. I bow and respect. Hope to see you again soon at some rando paleo conference. Andrea in Burbank.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s awesome. Yeah, some days I feel like sticking my head under the chopping of wood, but-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Or in the bucket of water?</span></span></span></p>

Yeah. Man, this is an interesting question. It&#8217;s going to be reasonably controversial, but hey, what isn&#8217;t that we do at this point? But we noticed something when we moved to Reno. We had a couple of people reach out to us, and they were super excited the fact that we were here. And they ended up being plastic surgeons. And what we discovered was that, through processes that I still am not entirely aware of, people were coming into their program, and they want a boob job or they want this or they want that, and somebody suggested, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t we do a lifestyle program for these people first?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And what it was was a low carb, ketogenic, paleo type deal. And what they noticed that, one, people ended up losing shocking amounts of weight on this program. So people would go in frequently, tummy tucks were the big deal, that&#8217;s what it was. Tummy tucks were the big deal, and/or liposuction. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">People would do this lifestyle deal of eight to 12 weeks of a paleo challenge type gig. They got done with that, and then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Wow, I don&#8217;t need a tummy tuck anymore.&#8221; And so then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, what about boobs and eyebrows?&#8221; And all this stuff.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then when they would do the surgery on these people, they were just stunned with how well they recovered. I mean, shocked with how well they recovered. Scarring was virtually non-existent. And something that people don&#8217;t really appreciate is that these big glucose spikes and crashes with regards to scar formation are really nasty. With regards to immune response, are really terrible. These big glucose deltas cause suppression in an immune response. So everything that you would want to go into effective healing is fucked up with bad diet.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I had LASIK done 2007?</span></span></span></p>

It was eight, it was eight. It was after we went to Nicaragua. Because you had your glasses when you were trying to snorkel there.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right. Yeah. It sucked. So I went to this guy, he&#8217;s one of the best LASIK surgeons on the West Coast. I was ketogenic at the time, because I had read a lot of stuff about wound healing. And it was very early, but in my mind, reduced glycemic load and all that stuff made a ton of sense. Did the surgery, it went great, I was ecstatic. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Went back two weeks later, three weeks later, a month, whatever it was, to get checked up, and the doctor literally, so I&#8217;m sitting looking in this thing, and he looks, and then he looks around, and he looks in there, and he looks around, and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You aren&#8217;t fucking with me, are you?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221; And he was like, &#8220;It is you, you don&#8217;t have a twin?&#8221; And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; And then he was like, &#8220;You have absolutely no scarring from the surgery. I mean, none.&#8221; He could detect no scarring.</span></span></span></p>

And, &#8220;Oh, gee whizz, it&#8217;s the downside of doing this.&#8221; And knock on wood, but I have no problem with that. I get a little bit of dry eye, if the wind blows in my eyes after LASIK, that has been a little bit of a problem, where my eyes will water. But he said that I would need a tune-up on this stuff and/or would need reading glasses five years ago, six years ago. More than that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But every once in a while, if I have really fine print, I will pull out some reading glasses. But I had no scarring. The LASIK has lasted way longer than it was supposed to. And we&#8217;ve heard similar reports from people.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So as far as a prescription, this person&#8217;s going into surgery, let&#8217;s say three or four weeks from now. Beef, salmon, blueberries.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Low carb paleo type deal. Even just for the weeks leading up to and the weeks afterwards at a minimum. Again, knock on wood, but it&#8217;s really interesting. Shawn Baker is a surgeon. Most of the people that were early to adopt low carb have been surgeons. Because they would see someone change their diet, and then it wasn&#8217;t like, &#8220;Oh, well, I don&#8217;t know. Their cholesterol went up.&#8221; And an internal medicine person is like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it really did all that much.&#8221; But a fucking surgeon, they&#8217;re looking at suture lines and wound healing and complications, and they&#8217;re keeping statistics on that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And that&#8217;s why the plastic surgeons that we&#8217;ve met and have become friends with in Reno, their complication rate just plummeted. It got to a point where they were like, &#8220;No, you need to do this lifestyle program first, before I&#8217;m going to do anything.&#8221; And it became a little bit of a non-negotiable deal there.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So for this person, it sounds like they still kind of eat poorly. But just trying to get a little bit on top of a lower glycemic load paleo type approach. This might be an argument for an exogenous ketone deal, where they&#8217;re using them before, during, and after this process. Because the ketogenic state is itself anti-inflammatory, it tends to promote a lowering in blood glucose levels and whatnot. So this is maybe one of those scenarios where an exogenous ketone-</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Matt says: &#8220;Robb and Nicki, thanks for all that you do. You, your books, and podcasts have changed my life. I have done two days a week of CrossFit for just over two years, and in spite of the amount of rest I get, I still end up with knee, shoulder, wrist, and elbow injuries and pain. I recently decided to pause my CrossFit subscription and have replaced it with three days a week of five by five routine recommended by the keto gains guys.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;I did your keto masterclass and I&#8217;m at 7.5% body fat, and try to keep my macros on point with the keto gains recommendations. What do you think about just doing the five by five home workout alone? I do like the group element of the CrossFit class, but at my age, 52, I can&#8217;t seem to go for long without injury or constant pain. I feel like the five by five program at home is much more manageable, as I can control the velocity and intensity without so much emotional effort. What are your thoughts regarding this path?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Sounds like you&#8217;re on a good path, Matt.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You&#8217;re on a good path, yeah. You&#8217;re doing largely what we&#8217;ve done. And a couple of thoughts on the community piece. You could look around for a gym like Sarah and Grayson with Basis in Chico. There are a lot of gyms that have shifted out of CrossFit, are still CrossFit but offer a barbell program. There are a few affiliates that Mark Rippeto has put out there where there are starting strength gyms. So you could poke around and try to find a gym that is more amenable-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Lifting oriented.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">-to just lifting, and maybe pushing a prowler, and doing some basic conditioning-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Without the competitive piece.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. And this is the reason why we modified our programming early on. We just, for certain classes, ceased writing names on the board and all that stuff. Because people needed the community more than they needed the competition.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other thought is to join a Jiu Jitsu school. Which itself can be problematic, because we&#8217;re back into that quality control deal. You need to find a good school. If you live near a Straight Blast Gym affiliate, then that&#8217;s great. There&#8217;s not a ton of them around. So you would need to do some poking around, because you-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One that has a lot of women and older folks, so it&#8217;s not just 20 year old guys that want to somehow be in the UFC one day.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Right. Yeah. But otherwise, you&#8217;re facing somewhat the same challenges as you do from CrossFit gym with Jiu Jitsu gyms, in that if they cater overly to the competition side of things, then you&#8217;re going to be in the same kind of dinged up, broken scenario.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But yeah. Lifting. Getting out, walking, doing things you enjoy.</span></span></span></p>

We&#8217;ve been talking, we did some salsa dancing years ago, because we were invited to a big hoity toity wedding where the-</span></span></span></p>

But that&#8217;s something we want to get back into, just doing some salsa dancing or something like that, to have a little bit of community, learn a new skill set, and all that type of stuff. It&#8217;s big, that community piece is huge, for sure.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/lT7lqWCZWlo"><b>Mild Caloric Deficit</b></a> [<em>1:33</em>]</p>
<p>Scott says:</p>
<p>Nice word on fasting. &nbsp;You have had a ton of discussions about Keto. &nbsp;My why for Keto is TONS of chronic disease and brain disease in my family tree. &nbsp;After hearing Dr. Perlmutter and then reading his book “Brain Grain” a year ago I decided to give Keto a go. &nbsp;Shortly there after you offered the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">Keto Masterclass</a>. Been doing it ever since. I won’t really know if I hit my “why” for another 15-25 years when I’m in my 70s &#8211; 80s. &nbsp;So keep on trucking’.</p>
<p>My wife and I own 1201 CrossFit here in Elkins, West Virginia. &nbsp;We have TONS of chronic disease and obesity here. One topic that would be helpful for us is setting macros for people. &nbsp;We have seen people go on severe caloric deficits and get frustrated when their bodies hold on to the weight. And in one case, we have seen the opposite where a guy lost 120 pounds on Keto eating 3000 cal/day. &nbsp;But others struggle to loose because they probably just aren’t set right calorically. You occasionally mention a “mild caloric deficit”. I would love to hear how you determine that. Note also that we have an InBody 530 that gives a pretty good Base Metabolic Rate. &nbsp;We are thinking people should be about 500-1000 Cal above that BMR. Do you agree?</p>
<p>I have both of your books, been listening to your podcast for years and even heard you speak over at the MadLab group. &nbsp;Always enjoy your perspective.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong><a href="https://youtu.be/_JtspzPLgME"><b>TV at Bedtime?</b></a> [<em>9:14</em>]</p>
<p>Ashley says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb and Nicki!</p>
<p>I have a question about watching TV at bedtime. Now I&#8217;ve heard and read over and over how this is a terrible thing &#8211; the light penetrates the pineal gland, suppresses melatonin production and prevents you from falling asleep, etc. I&#8217;m just wondering if this is one of those hard and fast rules. So many things are generally good, but you have to make sure they work for you individually. I&#8217;ve gotten into a bad habit of watching TV when I go to bed. But I watch it to put me to sleep. When I don&#8217;t have it on, the silence is deafening so to speak. My brain won&#8217;t shut off. But as soon as I turn on Frasier I&#8217;m out in less than 5 minutes, almost like it shuts off my brain. Am I just fooling myself? Is my brain really not shutting off and doing what it needs to do because of the light? I don&#8217;t feel like I sleep terribly but I also don&#8217;t wake up refreshed most of the time. But I also have thyroid and other hormonal issues and I think those can affect sleep as well. Anyway, I&#8217;d love to get your opinion on this. I&#8217;ve had a really hard time breaking this habit.</p>

<p><b>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/c3XFrsSx_1U">TRT: Healthy?</a> [</b><em>18:43</em><b>] </b></p>
<p>Mike says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>I am a testicular cancer survivor and due to operations and intense chemotherapy have hypogonadism (chronic low T). Over the past year, I have gotten my health under control, lost about 80 pounds using Paleo/keto as well as getting my T levels regulated through TRT. &nbsp;Without replacement my levels were in the low 200s. With it I am about 500-650.</p>
<p>My Dr tells me that it is healthy to use TRT. &nbsp;&nbsp;I assume it&#8217;s healthier than being chronically low. &nbsp;Do you think so? What are some natural ways to raise T?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><a href="https://youtu.be/IU77W0wIDvE"><b>Exercise for 60+</b></a> [<em>27:43</em>]</p>
<p>Philip says:</p>
<p>I am a 63 yo male in pretty decent shape. Except for a nagging hip injury I feel great. The hip doesn’t seem to have caused any loss in mobility or function (I can back squat 250lbs.). I consider myself to be Paleo since 2011 and recently have thrown in some keto and intermittent fasting. I’m wondering because of the hip and my age if I should be lifting crazy heavy (going for new PBs and competing at local CrossFit gyms) or should I be lifting lighter (and safer?) with more reps?</p>
<p>Do you have any guidelines for people “wiser” than 60?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/BPAarDZuXCc"><b>Stubborn Bodyfat at 47 &amp; Up!</b></a> [<em>33:49</em>]</p>
<p>JP says:</p>
<p>Hello Robb.</p>
<p>Should I be modifying programming or diet because I&#8217;m over 45?</p>
<p>Now for some context:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to dial in all of the factors that are important for longevity (health span). &nbsp;To be more precise I want to:</p>
<p>&#8211; Retain or put on as much lean mass as possible (difficult)</p>
<p>&#8211; Get below 15% bodyfat and stay there (difficult)</p>
<p>&#8211; Maintain or increase mobility (doable)</p>
<p>&#8211; Get good sleep (I&#8217;m good on this one)</p>
<p>&#8211; Community (just joined a CrossFit gym)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 47 and what you would call &#8220;skinny fat&#8221;. &nbsp;It seems impossible to get my body fat below 22%. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been doing Paleo for about 6 years (about 70/30), tried keto (although I think I went overboard on the fat), and last year did 6 weeks of PSMF (that was very tough). &nbsp;Only thing that got me below 20% was the PSMF but its not sustainable and over the holidays gained all the weight back.</p>
<p>I try to stay abreast of the science and avidly consume your work along with Peter Attia, Chris Masterjohn, Chris Kresser, etc. &nbsp;I am also known to browse through PubMed on my leisure time. All that to say that I&#8217;m eager to learn and I am as informed as my capabilities allow on these topics.</p>
<p>I have been lifting 2 &#8211; 3 times a week throughout and try to limit my cardio to short intense stints. &nbsp;I had been trying to do the &#8220;minimum viable dose&#8221; thing but results are not anything to write home about plus its kind of lonely <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Recently I have seen several folks online talk about how if you&#8217;re over 40 you need to &#8220;do things differently&#8221;. &nbsp;Invariably there is a pitch for an eBook or a class at the end of the story.</p>
<p>Point is:</p>
<p>I get good sleep</p>
<p>I do strength training 2 &#8211; 3 times a week</p>
<p>I&#8217;m eating &#8220;mostly&#8221; paleo</p>
<p>But I just can&#8217;t get consistently below the damn 20% body fat mark!</p>
<p>Should I be doing something different because I&#8217;m approaching 50?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>JP</p>

Our first question for this week is from Scott, on a mild caloric deficit. He says, you&#8217;ve had a ton of discussions about Keto. My wife for Keto is tons of chronic disease and brain disease in my family tree. After hearing doctor Perlmutter and then reading his book Brain Green a year ago, I decided to give Keto ago. Shortly thereafter, you offered the <a href="https://robbwolf.lpages.co/km-spl/?utm_campaign=RW-podcast-question-transcript&amp;utm_medium=podcast-blog&amp;utm_source=Q&amp;A-podcast&amp;utm_content=q&amp;a-question-KM-mention&amp;utm_term=Q&amp;A-listeners">Keto masterclass</a>, and I&#8217;ve been doing it ever since, you won&#8217;t really know if I hit my wife or another 15 to 25 years when I&#8217;m in my seventies and eighties, so I&#8217;m going to Keep on tracking.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Awesome. Cool. Man, there&#8217;s a lot to unpack on that, which these good questions oftentimes elicit a good bit of unpacking. Four years ago, before I really started hanging out with Tyler and Luis from Keto Gains, I would have been more inclined to ascribe negative outcomes to an over, like he mentioned somewhere in here that, people would stall as their bodies trying to hold on because of too severe of a caloric deficit. I don&#8217;t believe that anymore. Now I&#8217;m not saying that you can&#8217;t screw yourself up hormonally and have some problems from an overly aggressive caloric deficit, particularly in the context of hard training, also the whole female athlete, triad, deal, worthy.[inaudible 00:03:41] and all that type of stuff can happen.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But, I just saw time and again, Tyler and Luis, somebody would pop up on their forums, and they&#8217;re like, I can&#8217;t lose weight. I&#8217;ve stalled. And it&#8217;s pretty funny because they do a good cop, bad cop deal, and they will switch hats. How they do with this, and one of them would approach the person very gently and kind and the other one would kind of hammer them. But every goddamn time, the person was cheating. They were eating far more than what they were reporting. There was always some emotional baggage attached to it and then a big Kumbaya and everybody hugs and kisses and then the person gets their shit together and then their on point and they move forward.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So as a baseline, when we ran our gym, and I was much more of the mind that, I don&#8217;t know, maybe some low thyroid here, and that does pop up occasionally, but there&#8217;s just kind of a reality. And this is Gauche, but nobody comes out of a concentration camp still obese. Nobody. It just doesn&#8217;t fucking happen. So there is &#8230; And you have the most downregulated metabolism that you could imagine in those scenarios, &#8217;cause people are literally starving to death and people continue to lose weight unto the point of death.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And so, it was just kind of a reality that it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to set those things. There&#8217;s all kinds of emotional elements to it. I know that that wasn&#8217;t really quite the specific question, but it&#8217;s something to lean in on, is a reality that if people are not losing weight, it is because 99.9% of the time they are over eating. Now, sleep can change things. Which the main thing, lack of sleep-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">They may not be counting properly either. We had a client who&#8217;s an attorney, who was eating nuts every day, and it turned out that he was eating one of those full container, Costco containers of cashews. So he was having his nuts, but &#8230; I guess making really, really sure that they are tracking and they&#8217;re counting accurately.</span></span></span></p>

There&#8217;s a lot of different ways to do it. Honestly, the KetoGains Macro Nutrients calculator, is phenomenal. Smart coaches could just take the person&#8217;s data, which you look on there, they want to know a weight and approximate body fat percentage-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Activity level.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Activity level. And on the body fat percentage, if you just do a Google image search, body fat percentage, men and women, then it will order this stuff out. And if you&#8217;re within 5%, you&#8217;re good. Just err on the Chubbier side, it&#8217;s really easy. Or if you have more sophisticated methods of determining body fat fatness, then I guess that&#8217;s fine. But that actually works really well, because it&#8217;s a starting place. That&#8217;s where we jump in, and I would generally set the protein from that. KetoGains Macro Nutrients calculator, at the Keto gains recommended, which is one gram of protein per pound of lean body mass. And then go from there. And if people need more carbs than where that Keto intervention, sets them up, then you &#8230;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A real easy way to adjust that is, for every two grams of carbohydrate that you add, you delete basically one gram of fat. Math isn&#8217;t exact but pretty damn close. That&#8217;s a real easy way to tinker all that stuff. So if the person is just, so they run a crossfit gym, maybe they don&#8217;t want everybody at specifically ketogenic levels, but you could use the KetoGains Macro Nutrients calculator, to establish a baseline of calories and the caloric deficit that they said, ends up being about 10% below what the maintenance level is theoretically calculated from that. You can set up more aggressively, but that&#8217;s a decent place to start.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then again, if you want more carbs in the mix, then what the KetoGains recommendations are, you just need to kind of manually adjust that, break that into either two or three meals a day. Done. Don&#8217;t fuck around with snacks. Don&#8217;t make it fancy, two meals a day is great. I mean, take the daily allotment, either divide it into equal amounts or do one 70% and do it earlier in the day and 30% later. You can really simplify this stuff and then the person just becomes serial killer, consistent. You readjust those numbers once the person&#8217;s lost 10 pounds or maybe like 10% of body weight. If you have a smaller person, then 10 pounds may not be as &#8230; You may have a very small female, who is overweight for her scenario, but a 10 pound weight loss may be Max it for them. So yeah. Did I miss anything on that?</span></span></span></p>

And the interesting thing is, within the KetoGains Macro Nutrients calculator, puts a calculated basal metabolic rate as part of that. And again, it&#8217;s very easy to do. You&#8217;re just going to need to ask the person, what their weight is and then you will need to figure out body fat percentage by Hook or by Crook and visual-</span></span></span></p>

And then, since we have shifted to mainly writing books and working on blogs and podcasts, we barely get off our ass, which sucks but that&#8217;s just kind of the reality of online pimping and horan is, you spend a lot of time on your back or butt. So, yeah.</span></span></span></p>

Our next question is from Ashley on TV at bedtime. Hi Robb and Nicki, I have a question about watching TV at bedtime. Now I&#8217;ve heard and read over and over how this is a terrible thing. The light penetrates the pineal gland, suppresses Melatonin production and prevents you from falling asleep, et cetera. I&#8217;m just wondering if this is one of those hardened fast rules. So many things are generally good, but you have to make sure they work for you individually.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;ve gotten into a bad habit of watching TV when I go to bed, but I watch it to put me to sleep. When I don&#8217;t have it on, the silence is deafening, so to speak. My brain won&#8217;t shut off, but as soon as I turn on Frasier, I&#8217;m out in less than five minutes, almost like it shuts off my brain. Am I just fooling myself? Is my brain not really shutting off and doing what it needs to do because of the light? I don&#8217;t feel like I sleep terribly, but I also don&#8217;t wake up refreshed most of the time, but I also have thyroid and other hormonal issues and I think those can affect sleep as well. Anyway, I&#8217;d love to get your opinion on this. I&#8217;ve had a really hard time breaking this habit.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do you want to tackle this one?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I would just say that, she&#8217;s saying that her brain won&#8217;t shut off when she&#8217;s laying in bed. This is something that I have struggled with in the past and for the last, Gosh, six weeks we started doing it-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And by struggle, I&#8217;m drifting off and I can literally fucking hear the gears in Nicki&#8217;s head going &#8230;. Now, it hasn&#8217;t happened in ages because of what she&#8217;s going to share it with you in a minute. But I don&#8217;t know if it was a vibration or a shock or a misalignment or what it was, but I would literally be like, why the fuck are you still awake? What are you doing? [crosstalk 00:11:53]</span></span></span></p>

I would just review my day and ruminate and think about things that already happened, which aren&#8217;t serving me at all, when I&#8217;m trying to sleep. And then I would go through a phase where I&#8217;d be like, okay, the best thing that I can do for myself and my body right now is to sleep. So I try to tell myself to turn off my brain. And that wasn&#8217;t really that effective either.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But, I came across a book by a woman named Emily Fletcher called, Stress Less, Accomplish More. And it&#8217;s on meditation, but it&#8217;s in a super accessible way. She says in there, the goal, we&#8217;re modern people, most of us don&#8217;t have the time to go be monks and sit on a mountain and meditate blissfully every single day. So she has a very accessible program that we&#8217;ve been doing for the last six weeks. And honestly-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">For years, I&#8217;ve just called complete bullshit on meditation practices. I&#8217;m just like, whatever, that works for you. My meditation is spear fishing and Jujitsu. I&#8217;m either trying to kill something or something&#8217;s trying to kill me. And in that moment, I&#8217;m focused and everything. But, I was so stressed out working on two books at the same time. And Nikki was basically like, please just read these four pages, which was basically the how to piece. And I read it and I was like, this totally makes sense. I&#8217;m going to give it a shot. It was life altering-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One of the compelling things too, early in the book she talks about how meditation affects sleep and she shows a graphic of a person-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">They have some great documentation, I mean, legit sleep interventions.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. She shows a graphic of a person&#8217;s brain waves, premeditation. And then that same individual&#8217;s brain waves during sleep, three days post meditation. It&#8217;s stunning the difference because after the meditation, the length of time that they&#8217;re in deep sleep is significantly greater than the first one. So, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s a really great book. I am not really a person that recommends a ton of books to people but I have either purchased and or recommended that book for multiple friends-</span></span></span></p>

My sister used to do that, and it&#8217;d drive me nuts whenever we&#8217;d go on vacation-</span></span></span></p>

This is one of these things. It&#8217;s kind of like, when we would dig into somebody&#8217;s nutritional background, they were doing literally everything wrong. So they had soda. If they had fruit, it was a banana. I mean [crosstalk 00:14:52] At every turn they were really fucking up and this isn&#8217;t a value judgment but when you look back you&#8217;re like God-</span></span></span></p>

They had just gravitated to this and we&#8217;ve just noticed that a lot of people who have thyroid issues and you said there were hormonal issues, it becomes kind of a feed forward mechanism where they stay up late and they stay up late doing a variety of things but &#8230; The TV I think is a big sign. I just couldn&#8217;t recommend the meditation book enough. And it&#8217;s called again?</span></span></span></p>

And then beyond that, I would really, really recommend doing that and that may solve all the internal buzzing head stuff. I would honestly be surprised if it didn&#8217;t, if you&#8217;re still going to use the TV to some degree in a winning process, get some really good blue blockers. Throw down some money. This is your self flagellation, go buy the Swannies, they&#8217;re a hundred bucks or something. This is your self flagellation, you get to buy a really expensive pair of blue blockers. Put those on and then get a TV that has a timer and then set the timer for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, whatever it is. But by hook or by crook, figure we need some mitigating strategies. Everybody who has this type of pattern going on, has some stuff that is just very predictable as far as kind of metabolic related problems. And I wish it wasn&#8217;t the case, but it is.</span></span></span></p>

Over the past year I&#8217;ve gotten my health under control, lost about 80 pounds using Paleo Keto, as well as getting my T levels regulated through TRT, testosterone replacement therapy. Without replacement, my levels were in the low two hundreds, with it, I&#8217;m about 500 to 650. My doctor tells me that it&#8217;s healthy to use TRT and I assume it&#8217;s healthier than being chronically low. Do you think so? And what are some natural ways to raise testosterone?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, that&#8217;s a big topic. What&#8217;s interesting is whether we&#8217;re talking males or females, there&#8217;s some really contradictory information suggesting that hormone replacement is negative or raises potential for different cancers and whatnot. And when you really get in and look at that stuff, it&#8217;s pretty bogus. And when you look at effective aging, people that age well, we just visually look at them and again, whether male or female, that person looks pretty damn good for their age.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If we look under the hood, typically they have more youthful profiles of hormones. Dr. Kirk Parsley shared some data with me. This is just kind of a background baseline, but my grandparents generation, the men had on average at any given age, testosterone levels that were three times higher than what men have today. Now is it the Dizin estrogen? Is it social media? Is it just everybody being fucking whiny, twats most the time.? I don&#8217;t know, but none of it really feeds into good stuff. But there is I think a reality that, when people shift to that low end of normal and normal is a trap in this case because-</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We really learned this by doing our work with the Naval Special Warfare and seeing these seals that pre-deployment, they would have, of total testosterone, 1000 or 1100, I mean, they were at the top end of the food chain. They would come back post deployment and their total testosterone would be 100, 200. So it&#8217;s still within normal bounds because of the way that the population distribution is. And they average it from 20 year olds to 80 year olds. It&#8217;s so ridiculous. But there&#8217;s multiple things. So even lab corp recently, every couple of years they ratchet what the norms are for testosterone and estrogen in both men and women down or tweak the ratio. So they&#8217;re constantly adjusting these things so that the norm is heading in directions that are unfavorable.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Wow.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. It&#8217;s just because nobody coming through the front door, is now normal. They have to adjust it down to account for these norms. But what they&#8217;re not doing, is drawing a line in the sand and saying, hey, even though everybody in the population isn&#8217;t fitting these numbers, this is where they need to be. And so, yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Low testosterone that can lead into depression. It can lead to-</span></span></span></p>

Yeah. Increased cardiovascular disease, potential depression. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The loss of muscle mass, which is not good for effective aging. So I think finding, a good doc that sounds like a good one, in your scenario. So what I was going to say is, using the least aggressive intervention possible, I think makes a lot of sense. You&#8217;ve already done a bunch of good work. Just the fact that you&#8217;ve lost all that excess weight. Body fat has an enzyme in it called aromatase, and it will convert testosterone into estrogen, and this is one of the nasty things that happens if somebody is recognized as having low testosterone, but they&#8217;re also overweight, and their doctor puts, we&#8217;ll talk about men specifically in this scenario, puts them on testosterone and the testosterone doesn&#8217;t go up, and so then they put them on more testosterone, the testosterone doesn&#8217;t go up, and they put him on more testosterone, and they feel progressively worse and worse and worse.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, the brain doesn&#8217;t sense testosterone levels. It senses estrogen levels.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8216;Cause they have so much body fat?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">No, just the brain does not sense testosterone levels, it senses estrogen levels. Because what happens is, luteinizing hormone is released and then that causes the cascading effect of the release of testosterone, and then at some rate, the testosterone is going to get converted into estrogen. If the estrogen is too high, then it suppresses testosterone production. So these people who are overweight being given testosterone injections or even worse a cream, the cream, the testosterone goes through the adipose tissue and unless they&#8217;re on some sort of an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex or something like that, they&#8217;re going to convert virtually all of the testosterone into estrogen, which then the brain sees, Holy Shit, there&#8217;s a mountain of estrogen around, turn your balls off, basically.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, this is where &#8230; And then it&#8217;s like, well, TRT didn&#8217;t work for me. And it&#8217;s like, well, your doctor is a fucking idiot. They probably didn&#8217;t even do a weekend course on this stuff. I&#8217;m not going to name any names, but there are a lot of popular interventions out there that docs will go get their kind of anti-aging certification. They fucking suck. These people have no idea what they&#8217;re doing. They started the most aggressive intervention, and I guess on the one hand, it&#8217;s better than nothing in a way. But the problem is that it just gives us whole scene node a bad name. People handle this stuff in a completely ham-handed fashion. So again, so there was a question here. What can you do to naturally raise testosterone levels?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, losing weight, which is what&#8217;s his name again?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mike.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So Mike already did that, smartly went on some sort of a low carb, Paleo Keto type of approach. Beyond that, getting proper photo period. Some things like D-ribose can can be a little bit helpful, but there&#8217;s just kind of a reality that the stuff that you&#8217;ve gone through with the surgery and the Chemo and the radiation, that just kind of kicks your ass to some degree. But there are things like hCG or Clomid, which help to stimulate the production of testosterone at the brain level. So in those scenarios, sometimes men can get a remarkable boost in testosterone production and then they may be able to titrate off that stuff. Sometimes they need to maintain it for, an indefinite period of time. But there&#8217;s all these really interesting interventions that can be used that are super minimal, provide the substrate and the stimulus for your body to make its own testosterone, so it gets managed and dealt with in a more natural way.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And maybe you could write that into your 50s or 60s and then once you hit 60 and like the Arimidex plus Clomid plus hCG protocol isn&#8217;t really working so well anymore. Then you go on a super modest dose of subdermal testosterone injections and by the time you hit 75, 80 years old, just go full Sylvester Stallone, and it&#8217;s growth hormone and you just go crazy. But what you&#8217;ve done there is, you&#8217;ve bought yourself a youthful hormonal profile, while staying, the real problem with TRT, is the super physiological levels.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you&#8217;re staying within physiological levels, it&#8217;s mainly all upside, not much in the way of downside. So there&#8217;s not a ton you can do beyond what you&#8217;re already doing on the natural enhancement side. And honestly given someone&#8217;s background like this, where they&#8217;ve been roughed up pretty good, and it would be similar if we had someone who was a seal, or some sort of operate under, and they&#8217;ve had traumatic brain injury multiple times, I would be inclined to go more aggressive but minimal intervention. So things like hCG, Clomid, Arimidex used tactfully, which you need a good doc to do that. They&#8217;re just aren&#8217;t that many good doctors out there.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I can&#8217;t tell you how many endocrinologists I&#8217;ve chatted with and I&#8217;ll just kind of run this stuff up the flagpole and they have no idea about any of this jive and it doesn&#8217;t make me smart or them necessarily dumb, but people are not really doing diligence on investigating this stuff and doing right by their patients.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is from Phillip on excessive endurance exercise. Phillip says, I am a 63 year old male in pretty decent shape and except for a nagging hip injury, I feel great. The hip doesn&#8217;t seem to have caused any loss of mobility or function. I can back squat 250 pounds. I consider myself to be Paleo since 2011 and recently I&#8217;ve grown in some Keto and intermittent fasting. I&#8217;m wondering because of the hip and my age, if I should be lifting crazy heavy, going for new personal bests and competing at local crossfit gyms or should I be lifting lighter and safer with more reps? Do you have any guidelines for people wiser than 60?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">One of the main characteristics of aging, is a loss of power production and the big motor unit complexes that involve the nerves, and the type 2b motor fibers. Those are the things that we lose most rapidly as we age. And the way to prevent that, is to either lift at or near maximal levels and or move somewhat lighter loads very, very quickly. Like the way a shot-putter works in a hammer throw and stuff like that. Olympic lifting can emulate a little bit of this. Some of the Westside Barbell self tries to emulate some of this stuff. But the question of whether or not, you should be going for personal best is a little bit challenging because I really don&#8217;t know how well you move. If your back squat and dead lift and press and push press and all that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If your form is spot on. And I&#8217;m like, yeah, push, go for some personal bests. For me, all of my personal bests are in the past. I was a competitive power lifter, I&#8217;m never ever going to reach those levels again, not without massive sacrifice. So what I have today, are just kind of temporal, personal bests. Oh, within the last two years that was the best I did on this or, or what have you. If you&#8217;re kind of new to lifting then you may have some great personal bests going in your future. So it&#8217;s a little bit hard to tell him that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And I&#8217;m wondering, you say you have this nagging hip injury, but it doesn&#8217;t cause loss of mobility or function, but do you have pain?

And so I would try to do activities that you alleviate that, once you get inflammation in the hip-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Stretch is a great, great idea to get into. But yeah, I mean, the point about the hip inflammation, if there&#8217;s an injury, typically there&#8217;s inflammation. If we know one thing that&#8217;s terrible for aging and health and longevity, it&#8217;s inflammation and having an injury that&#8217;s chronically just irritated, is an inflammatory state. So we definitely want to figure out what to do to get that fixed. And whenever I hear competing at local crossfit gyms, I&#8217;m just kind of like, No. It&#8217;s so hard because, we co-founded the first and fourth fucking crossfit gyms in the world, and it&#8217;s such a great community and there&#8217;s good stuff that goes on it, I guess. But it&#8217;s just such a cluster fuck of shitty programming. And-</span></span></span></p>

In general, I would say lighter weights. Higher reputations are okay, from just kind of a metabolic perspective and it might build a little bit of muscle mass, but you really need to affect those big type 2b motor fibers, explosive movements and also Max effort movements. You don&#8217;t have to do that every single time, but you need to do it on some sort of a consistent cadence. But prior to that, you need to get the fucking hit-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;d be furious if you took several weeks off of squatting and pulled and dragged a sled and did some other things and just see if you can get that thing feeling better. And then maybe bring back the squatting and ramped back up slowly.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Make sure from a coaching perspective, your bio mechanics are absolutely on point because if you just, if a car is well aligned, the tires will last, remarkably a long time. If it&#8217;s slightly out of alignment, the tires we&#8217;ll get chewed up in a few thousand miles versus 50,000 miles. So, the biomechanics are critical. Getting that inflammation down is important. I do think it&#8217;s important for people to lift some heavy weights as they age and this is-</span></span></span></p>

It can be three rep max, five rep max. It can be a variety of rep maxes. But the thing is, that comparatively it&#8217;s heavy. This is some of my, not issue but concern when people are like, well, I do yoga, or I do gardening, and I just don&#8217;t like being in the gym. That&#8217;s fine, I get it. But with a really minimal intervention of a full body weight training session two days a week, 15 or 20 minutes, you are getting so much benefit, in my opinion, from an anti aging perspective because, whatever we&#8217;re doing once you pass 30, 40, whatever it is, you&#8217;re declining. You&#8217;re declining.</span></span></span></p>

And if you are used to gardening, if you&#8217;re used to yoga, that&#8217;s not a challenge. It&#8217;s doing more, it&#8217;s not really a stimulus that the body needs to adapt to. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a little neurotic about getting in and at least doing some of this stuff. Strength training, sprints, jumps, all that type of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. We have time for one more?</span></span></span></p>

Mow for some context, I&#8217;m trying to dial in all of the factors that are important for longevity and health span. To be more precise, I want to retain or put on as much lean mass as possible, difficult. Get below 15% body fat and stay there, difficult. Maintain or increase mobility, doable. Get good sleep.

It seems impossible to get my body fat below 22%. I&#8217;ve been doing paleo for about six years, about 70, 30. Tried Keto, although I think I went overboard on the fat and last year I did six weeks of PSMF, that was very tough. The only thing that got me below 20% was the piece of PSMF, but it&#8217;s not sustainable and over the holidays I gained all the weight back. I tried to stay abreast of the science and avidly consumed your work along with Peter Attia, Chris Master, John Kresser, et cetera. I&#8217;m also known to browse through Pub Med in my leisure time. All that to say I&#8217;m eager to learn, and I&#8217;m as informed as my capabilities allow on these topics. I have been lifting two to three times a week throughout and try to limit my cardio to short, intense stints. I&#8217;ve been trying to do the minimum viable dose thing, but results are not anything to write home about, plus it&#8217;s kind of lonely.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Recently I&#8217;ve seen several folks on line talk about how if you&#8217;re over 40 you need to do things differently. Invariably there&#8217;s a pitch for an ebook or a class at the end of this story. Point is I get good sleep. I do strength training two to three times a week. I&#8217;m eating mostly Paleo, but I just can&#8217;t consistently get below the dam 20% body fat mark. Should I be doing something different because I&#8217;m approaching 50? JP.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We had a question earlier on from an individual that had gone through a testicular cancer therapies and was asking about testosterone replacement therapy. This is something that I would probably find a good doctor who could do some blood work and really assess where you are. And it&#8217;s not just testosterone, it&#8217;s testosterone, estrogen, estradiol, sex hormone, binding globulin. They need to look at a lot of stuff to really have a good sense of what&#8217;s going on. If your doctor runs a total testosterone, and they&#8217;re like, oh, you look good, then that person is an idiot. He or she literally has no idea what they&#8217;re talking about.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So this is one of those scenarios in which I would look at kind of the hormonal underpinnings. And this is funny, we&#8217;ve listened to so many of these, you kind of like, I&#8217;m get some bullshit here, but okay, that sounds right. That sounds right. That sounds right. That all seems on point. Jp sounds he&#8217;s neither deluding himself nor trying to delude us. And so the next thing that I would definitely look at, is kind of the hormonal state, thyroid, testosterone and everything associated with that. And if you&#8217;re at the lower end of normal, this could be the case for looking into something like an hCG protocol, a Clomid protocol or possibly even some sort of low dose, appropriately dosed testosterone supplementation, there&#8217;s palettes and there&#8217;s other stuff. But, those are the things that I&#8217;ve kind of researched more. But that&#8217;s the stuff that I&#8217;m looking at-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m so curious about your stress levels, you don&#8217;t mention that but that can be a thing that kind of-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Even I have a feeling the stress levels are probably not a big deal, just because this is a reasoned and well punctuated and organized &#8230; It&#8217;s so funny, you get the frenetic, when people are stressed out, it&#8217;s a jumble fucking mess when we get this stuff. This seems like a very centered, reasonable, balanced person. JP probably has a whole wardrobe of dresses made out of human skin, because this is a ray of reasonable, but JP seriously, it sounds like you&#8217;re really on point.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I would be super curious to know what you look like from a thorough, androgen profile perspective and just off the top of my head really quickly. And we want free and total testosterone, sex hormone, binding globulin or protein, whatever they call it these days. Estrogen, estradiol and then a legit thyroid panel, T3, T4, reverse T3 thyroid uptake. We&#8217;ll put something together on this stuff to help people zero in on what tests they need to get. But, that&#8217;s where I would look &#8217;cause it sounds like you&#8217;re on point with everything else and if the hormonal state is there, then the rest of this stuff shouldn&#8217;t be that hard.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. <a href="https://youtu.be/aDNwIWF8FJM">Fasting: Minimum Hours? </a></b>[2:08]</p>
<p>Raysha says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>Really appreciate all the work you are doing. You are a huge inspiration to me and hopefully one day, I&#8217;ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>Just a quick question, what&#8217;s the minimum number of hours someone should fast if they just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours and I have heard you mention that its a good fasting duration in one of your podcasts. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. <a href="https://youtu.be/scFqe76QDVs">Alcohol While Paleo?</a> [</b>4:30]</p>
<p>Jay says:</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. &nbsp;In your opinion, why is this done since according to the WHO alcohol is a known carcinogen sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is “no safe amount” to avoid its’ effects so why is it promoted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/POoZIQrRPEk">Former Smokers: Can Paleo Reverse Damage?</a></b> [10:02]</p>
<p>Filipe says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb</p>
<p>Thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective (and personal) health. Your teachings left a lasting, highly beneficial imprint on by health and on by wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the U.S. alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much. All the best</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. <a href="https://youtu.be/oJuQjqeGMbs">Gymnastics Training For Jiu Jitsu?</a></b> [13:17]</p>
<p>Duey says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings.</p>
<p>Do you have any free resources for beginners you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Straight arm strength in particular is tough to come by. Trying to find progressions for those.</p>
<p>Also, I’m curious as to what you like to do for neck and wrist conditioning. Mine are always creaky from grappling.</p>
<p>Best</p>
<p>Duey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. <a href="https://youtu.be/XztPRdrw4o4">Oil Roasted Almonds </a></b>[16:36]</p>
<p>Kathleen says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>First I wanted to say thank you for all the valuable info you provide. You are one of the few voices I fully trust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new.</p>
<p>With that, I have heard you say on the podcast that you eat a lot of blue diamond smokehouse almonds (I love those) and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them in favor of the blue diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smokehouse say that they may be roasted in canola or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable/canola oil whenever possible, but I assume the amount of oil you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? If everything is dialed in and you’re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you’d be getting from this? Or have you seen evidence that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your advice!</p>
<p>Kathleen</p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Even met several of you, who have had your questions answered on the podcast, so that was awesome, super fun.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. Met a ton of people who&#8217;ve gone through the keto master class. Just a really amazing event, a long event, I&#8217;m totally knackered by the end of those, but super cool. Yeah.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">A lot of fun.</span></span></p>

And it was kind cool getting you back in the trenches there, that was fun. You haven&#8217;t been in the mix for a while because of the kiddos.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m like an every other year Paleo FX attendee.</span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, should we jump into this week&#8217;s first question?</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Sure.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s see, we have a question from Raysha , on the minimum hours for fasting. She says, &#8220;Hi Rob, I really appreciate all the work you are doing. You are a huge inspiration, and hopefully one day I&#8217;ll be able to make as big a difference as you have in people&#8217;s lives. Just a quick question, what&#8217;s the minimum number of hours someone should fast, if the just want to maintain good health? I typically fast about 12 hours, and I&#8217;ve heard you mention that it&#8217;s a good fasting duration in one of your podcast. Is this enough if I just want good metabolic health?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. I mean, a concise answer would be yes, that&#8217;s a good spot to be. Again, you know, it&#8217;s interesting, the fasting topic, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about it, I think we&#8217;ll talk about it for the next 10 or 20 years, assuming that we&#8217;re still in this, doing this stuff. But it&#8217;s a really powerful tool, it&#8217;s a cool tool. But like any tool, you wanna use it appropriately, and there are definitely scenarios in which more is not better, with regards to fasting. If somebody is exercising a ton, if they&#8217;re under a lot of stress, it may, 12 hours may be plenty.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And honestly, some of the research, when you really get in and scrape out the vegan centric dogma, and some of the hyperbole, and everything, 12 hours is a decent spread. If you can compress it a little bit more, that&#8217;s fine, but there&#8217;s definitely scenarios, like a breastfeeding or a nursing mom, a growing child, a hard training athlete, you know, there are scenarios where 12 hours may be the maximum that we wanna tinker with that stuff.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Everything that we know about, just simply not overeating, and building muscle mass, and all that type of stuff, we know that there&#8217;s good benefit there. The extended fasting si speculative at this point, what it means for human health performance, longevity, and </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">whatnot</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">. So, certainly get in and tinker, but don&#8217;t overly link your wagon to something that we just don&#8217;t know that much about yet.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And if you start noticing some adverse effects &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yes.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then obviously you&#8217;re gonna wanna change </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">something.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s the time to pull the rip cord on that. Yeah. Yeah.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay. Thanks to Raysha, our next question is from Jay, Jay has a good question. Should I consume alcohol while on paleo? Jay says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed that some nutrition experts detour from their mission of nutritional health, seemingly to promote the ingestion of certain alcoholic beverages. In your opinion, why is this done? Since according to the World Health Organization, alcohol is a known carcinogen, sometimes leading to esophageal, stomach, breast cancer, etc. Apparently there is no safe amount to avoid its effects, so why is it promoted?&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s a really good question. I kind of struggled with this over the course of time, when we were running the gym, the timing, the place, we were earlobe deep in real estate agents. I mean, just droves of them. Really interesting people, very diverse cross section of folks. And within that scene, the way you carry yourself, the way you look, that all ends up playing into how effective you are at what you do, because there&#8217;s a huge social component to building the relationship when somebody&#8217;s doing the biggest financial decision, often times, of their life.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, we had really good success with these folks, they would lose weight, they would feel better, and they had benefits based around that. But then we also had these folks report, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having some problems because I&#8217;m used to sitting down, and wining and dining people, and building that relationship &#8230; &#8220;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Meeting people, networking over &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Meeting people, networking &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Drinks and dinner.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. And there&#8217;s just kind of a reality that, I think you&#8217;re hard pressed to find very many cultures, there&#8217;s a few, that don&#8217;t use alcohol as a social lubricant, cohesive element. I would venture to say the bulk of cultures, like alcohol is a feature of the whole story. So, you know, we can get totally wrapped around the axle of, protein, carbs, fat, and circadian biology, and all the stuff. But we always mention the social component, and the community component, we know that an inadequate social connectivity is as negatively impactful on health as a pack a day smoking habit.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, you know, it&#8217;s a really interesting question though, you know, so I&#8217;m ingesting a known carcinogen, to have a social connectivity that maybe &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Given me joy, and is fun, and makes life &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. And what&#8217;s the net win on that? I don&#8217;t entirely know. But eve for myself, I honestly am not a huge fan of booze, it&#8217;s not my preferred cup of opiates, but it &#8230; There&#8217;s also kind of a reality that, I already eat differently than most people. It&#8217;s changed a lot over the last 20 years, so it&#8217;s easier to find community, easier to find folks that don&#8217;t look [inaudible 00:06:34] at me if I order a burger without a bun. It&#8217;s just not a </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">big</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> deal now, whereas 15, 20 years ago, you were totally a weirdo doing that.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But if we go hang out with friends, of we have a family gathering or something, like having a glass of wine, putting some element into a NorCal margarita, or something, that&#8217;s super nice. It&#8217;s just kinda nice to unwind and relax with that.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, Jay, I don&#8217;t know if that super answers your question, but &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think there&#8217;s also a reality that, when you&#8217;re trying to get people to start changing their food, and removing a lot of these processed foods, it&#8217;s like a baby step sort of thing. SO, if you said, &#8220;You&#8217;re not gonna eat any grains, no dairy, and no booze.&#8221; How many people would even give it a shot? Whereas, if you&#8217;re like, you&#8217;re gonna cut out the grains, you&#8217;re gonna try to eliminate dairy if it &#8230; Or at least see if it gives you problems and then maybe reintroduce &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And on booze &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">On booze, have a glass of red wine, or a NorCal margarita. And then over time, people just start drinking less anyway, because they notice the effects, and how their body feels with the alcohol, how it affects their sleep &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But that step wise story is a really important point, which I kind of neglected. Some people can jump in whole hog, and they just cut everything out, other people do better with a </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">stepwise</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> fashion. For a lot of people, if you suggest booze needs to come out of the rotation, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Fuck it. I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I mean, how many people have transformed their health with this ancestral health concept, right? And how many of those wouldn&#8217;t have even given it a shot if, in order to do it, it was zero booze?</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, I don&#8217;t know, Jay, if that fully answers the question of the risk reward story of allowing, or recommending booze. But I think that this is a great example of trying to not make perfection the antagonist of good enough. Like, if we&#8217;re getting people off of refined carbohydrates, they&#8217;re sleeping better, they&#8217;re exercising, they feel better, then to your point, it really is true. If they start feeling better in general, what we find, is that people have a drink, maybe two, and then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;That&#8217;s enough.&#8221; Because they feel shitty enough from that, that they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m totally good.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, interestingly, it does kind of self regulate on the back end of that, if we get the buy in on the front end with all those other things. But if you&#8217;re just living like a cockroach, and you just feel like shit all the time, it&#8217;s really hard to de-tangle, is it the crappy carbohydrates? Is it the booze? Is it &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">The lack of sleep.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">The lack of sleep, yeah, because it&#8217;s all on top of you. But you start feeling better, and you actually notice the difference when you have booze.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Our next question is from Felipe, he says, &#8220;Paleo lifestyle is a way of minimizing the occurrence of cancer in former smokers. Hey Rob, thank you for your wonderful contributions to our collective and personal health, your teachings left a lasting and highly beneficial imprint on my health, and on my wellbeing. A part of that was quitting smoking. As a former smoker, what can I do now to minimize the risks of cancer? Since there are millions of former smokers in the US alone, your answers will certainly appeal to a large audience. Thank you so much.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, this is really interesting, and there&#8217;s actually a very interesting development of late. Philip Morris, tobacco manufacturer extraordinaire, for a couple of hundred years, I think, they&#8217;ve been making tobacco products. They just started offering life insurance for people who quit smoking. There&#8217;s all kinds of interesting economic things to be learned from that, but it&#8217;s really interesting that the most important thing to do as a smoker, if you wanna minimize your risk of all the associated problems, is to just stop smoking.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Like, if you just stop smoking, the change that occurs on your risk profile is nothing short of amazing. And then beyond that, circadian biology, I would probably put right at the top of the list, get out in the sun early, get that sun on your skin, appropriate vitamin D levels, go to bed early. That circadian biology piece, I could almost make an argument, is more important on the whole cancer story. I may modify that over time.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But people get super focused on food, and the food is important. And again, for the cancer story, just not overeating is a huge factor. And then we start iterating beyond that. This is maybe a scenario though, that we could make a case for a couple of three to five day fasts a year, even for the first couple of years. It&#8217;s maybe an argument for a 16/eight eating window, and stuff like that.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But again, all of that stuff, I can&#8217;t emphasize it enough, it&#8217;s really cool. It&#8217;s really interesting, it may end up being the bees knees as we move along. But if we know anything for sure, if we sleep better, if we do some exercise, if we get out in the sun, if we lift some weights, if we don&#8217;t overeat, then we&#8217;re stacking the deck massively in our favor, we know that for a fact. And then some of these other things, if they&#8217;re amenable to your lifestyle, sure, drop them in. Little 16/eight fasting, maybe some extended ketosis, maybe a longer fast a couple of times a year.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But those things, I would definitely put in the highly speculative category at this point. Not that they&#8217;re not valuable, not that we shouldn&#8217;t investigate them, but really make sure that you are buttoned up on the things that we know about first, and then we can start iterating from there.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And I&#8217;m stoked that we&#8217;ve had influence on what you&#8217;ve done. Yeah. I could never get my parents to stop smoking, and that was one of the things that I just begged them to do. So that&#8217;s awesome that this has been a part of what&#8217;s happened.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Our next question is from Duey, on gymnastics and jits. &#8220;Hey Rob, I&#8217;m excited that my gym finally got gymnastics rings. Do you have any free resources for beginners that you would recommend? My primary sport is jiu jitsu. Straight arm strength, in particular, is tough to come by, trying to find progressions for those. Also, I&#8217;m curious as to what you do for neck and wrist conditioning, mine are always creaky from grappling.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Tap earlier. So, on the ring strength work, there&#8217;s a great book called, Overcoming Gravity, and, huge tome, but really has some slick progressions in it. Very simple. I&#8217;ve always like gymnastics bodies. The progressions tend to be a little on the long side, which I think is laudable, because coach Christopher Sommer put a lot of thought into that stuff. But sometimes folks just kinda run aground on that, so I would check out the book, Overcoming Gravity.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then on the neck and wrist conditioning, Nicki got me into the Kinstretch stuff, in which we do something called &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you look up, functional range conditioning, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s tons of YouTube videos on it, but you can learn how to do, what&#8217;s called CARs, Controlled Articular Rotations. And they have them for the neck, they have a wrist series as well. So, I mean, that something you should do every single day.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah. Yeah.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then, in poking around, you know, classic wrestler bridging, and stuff like that. There&#8217;s some information back and forth on whether or not one should do that, if you didn&#8217;t develop that skillset as a kid, then maybe it&#8217;s not as good. But, you know, doing a basic neck harness in strengthening the neck, inflection, extension, you know, lateral movement. There&#8217;s a thing called the iron halo, I believe, something like that, that I&#8217;ve been looking at. It&#8217;s like 600 bucks though, so it&#8217;s kinda pricey, but it looks really good. It sits on your head, and you hook it up to, either a pulley system, or a weights system, and then you can &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, is it like, resisting as you &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s resisting through all these different, you know, ranges of movement. Those things are really helpful. If you have a partner that is willing to help you with things, that can just provide manual resistance with all the different directions, that&#8217;s kind of a pain in the ass to do sometimes though, but that&#8217;s definitely helpful.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But then on the wrists, in particular, again, kind of back to the gymnastics bodies, or even some of the stuff from, Overcoming Gravity, like there&#8217;s the push ups, where you push up onto the wrist, and on the back of the hands. And you can go from kneeling, in which I push up, and then extend up on the kind of backs of the finger tips, and then lower down.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, again, there&#8217;s &#8230; If you poke around a little bit, there&#8217;s some good wrist conditioning stuff. Just getting, either a weighted &#8230; </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">a</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> pretty good sized hammer, or a bar with, like the, where you can put weights on one side, and doing the rotation, flexion, extension, like there&#8217;s all these different movements you can do with that. It&#8217;s really valuable, and really effective, but it&#8217;s super simple stuff. You just kind of need to get a little bit of a template, or an idea of some of the things to drop in on that.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s see. Our last question for this week is from Cathleen, on oil roasted almonds.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;Rob, first, I wanna say thank you for all the valuable info you provide. You&#8217;re one of the few voices I fully rust because you always follow the evidence and are willing to change your mindset if the evidence leads you somewhere new. With that, I have heard you say that you eat a lot of Blue Diamond smoke housed almonds, and it got me wondering. I have tended to avoid them, in favor of the Blue Diamond almonds that are roasted without any added oil, because the smoke housed say </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">that</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> they may be roasted in Canola, or other vegetable oil. I was curious your thoughts on this. I tend to totally avoid vegetable and Canola oil wherever possible, but I assume the amount of oil that you are actually ingesting with these almonds would be low. What are your thoughts? IF everything is dialed in, and you&#8217;re feeling good, do you not worry about the minimal amount you&#8217;d be getting from this? Or, have you seen that it takes more than this little bit of oil that the almonds would be roasted with to really create a problem? Thanks in advance.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Man, so one thing, I&#8217;m not doing so well with the almonds anymore. But I think that that&#8217;s more of an oxalate issue, is I&#8217;ve kind of poked around on that ironically, they taste so good. But, yeah, I get some kind of gnarly belly from it. Macadamias are kind of the main nut that I do occasionally, and even that I &#8230; Funny enough, I&#8217;m eating fewer and fewer vegetable sources, and shifting more and more carnivore, just tinkering with how my gut feels, how my digestion feels. I did like a three week, four week carnivore deal, and I kind of went insane because I just wanted a fucking avocado, and some artichokes, and stuff.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But eating keto, I never had food cravings, and then when I did that, I really went kind of bananas. But it is funny, I&#8217;ve been noticing, I&#8217;m kind of gravitating more that direction. I seem to do well with fruit, up to a point. So, it&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;m still tinkering with that.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But that&#8217;s not really the question, the question is related to, that fats in here. I don&#8217;t know that anybody knows what exactly the safe amount is on these seed oils. There&#8217;s not a lot that goes into something like these roasted almonds, it&#8217;s a very passing amount. If you are deficient in elongated omega 6 Arachidonic acid, and also, EPA/DHA, then these </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">shorter chain</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> polyunsaturated fats are more of an issue with regards to inflammation.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">But this is one of the things that, you know, it&#8217;s like, people will freak out if they go out to eat and, I don&#8217;t know, Chipotle, or something like that. You&#8217;re on the road, you&#8217;re looking for food, you have no other options, and you go into Chipotle or something, and it&#8217;s like, </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">“O</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">h, they use Canola oil.</span></span><span style="font-size: small;">”</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> And it&#8217;s like, well, either starve, or eat that one meal. And you&#8217;re not having refined grains, presumably, you&#8217;re not having sugar, you&#8217;re not </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">drinking</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> soda, so, is that really the place to freak out about it?</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And if you have serious health problems, and you notice that you react to that stuff, then I guess that&#8217;s a different story. But I&#8217;ve historically not been super freaked out about stuff like that. So, it&#8217;s interesting. Would I prefer that they use coconut oil on to, or something? Yeah, probably, but coconut oil has a very specific, distinct flavor, so it&#8217;s kind of tough in that regard too. So, yeah, I mean, I historically have not been that freaked out about a lot of vegetable oil here.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I remember when I did &#8230; Posted eating some, not sardines, but the oysters.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Oysters in </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">cottonseed</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> oil.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And they were in </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">cottonseed</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> oil. Fuck, man, people lost their minds. And one, you just don&#8217;t get that much, there&#8217;s not, you know &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">You weren&#8217;t drinking the oil.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, I don&#8217;t drink the oil, you drain it, you can even rinse it a little bit. But these things are &#8230; It&#8217;s another thing where people [inaudible 00:19:42] me with all these options for non-cotton seed oil varieties, and that&#8217;s great, but the places that we typically shop don&#8217;t have those. And it&#8217;s just another pain in my ass to, okay, am I gonna order it online, or whatever, and I have them reasonably frequently, but not every single day, so. And again, in the greater mix of life, it&#8217;s like, I like them, they taste really good, I think that there&#8217;s other healthful benefits to it, and so it&#8217;s kind of that cost benefit trade off on that.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And I don&#8217;t know, maybe it&#8217;s fucking killing me, and I&#8217;m being an idiot with it, but it&#8217;s just, I don&#8217;t like obsessing over every </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">Goddamn</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> thing that I put in my mouth. Like, I&#8217;m super gluten intolerant, I&#8217;m not all that good at handling carbs, so I&#8217;m already kind of fucking limited, and it&#8217;s just kind like, Jesus Christ, I just wanna </span></span><span style="font-size: small;">eat</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"> sometimes, you know. And that is &#8230;</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Sometimes I&#8217;m hesitant to even post what I eat online because again, all the armchair warriors jump in, and everybody&#8217;s got a fucking opinion, and they know me better than I know me. But at the same time, what ends up happening when I get in and battle with those dick heads sometimes is that, the people who are watching, I&#8217;m learning more and more that it&#8217;s not so much about the interaction I&#8217;m having with a specific person, it&#8217;s everybody else watching.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">And they&#8217;re watching somebody that, and I&#8217;m very grateful for this and I take it very seriously, someone that they respect with regards to how they approach this stuff. And I&#8217;m not obsessive, I&#8217;m not neurotic, there&#8217;s some things that I don&#8217;t have a lot of flexibility on. I&#8217;m not gonna, on a daily basis, sit down and eat 100 grams of carbs from rice, because it&#8217;s gonna fuck me up, and I&#8217;m gonna feel terrible, and I&#8217;ll probably die from diabetes with it. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m gonna die from a little bit of seed oil in almonds, or tinned fish, or something like that. So, that kind of got off in the weeds, but.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Any other, you have any thoughts on that? I mean, you navigate this stuff pretty well too, just being flexible with what you&#8217;re doing, and.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">I have nothing to add.</span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, should we thank our show sponsor?</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah.

<p><b>1. <a href="https://youtu.be/Zn3ns8b_eSU">Arterial Plaque Buildup</a></b></p>
<p>Christian says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb and Nicki!</p>
<p>I was wondering what your opinions were on stopping or reducing arterial plaque buildup.  Isn&#8217;t that one of the big reasons were obsessed with things like cholesterol as a society?  I know at one point Dr. Rocky Patel had stated he had significant reversal in his carotid artery after a few years of carb cycling (carb nite).  I know this question is absolute minefield of personal variability. At age 40, and a lifetime of combining things like shitty high omega 6 oils and highly process carbs, my new goal is to enjoy retirement.  My blood pressure has crept back up since falling off the low carb/carb cycling wagon at my new job. I don&#8217;t really think CVD is in too many branches of my family tree, but I always excelled at bad lifestyle choices.  I would love to hear what your current thoughts are on this.</p>
<p>I started following you in 2011 and absolutely love your work.  The more suggestions I take from you, the better my health gets!</p>

<p><b>2. <a href="https://youtu.be/RB5zV2KMHbk">Constructing A Workout Plan</a></b></p>
<p>TJ says:</p>
<p>New listener who absolutely loves your show so I figured I&#8217;d write in and try and get my question answered!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 5&#8217;11, 180 lbs, 19% body fat (give or take), and I&#8217;m looking to improve my physique. I would describe my look as just a bit more muscular than skinny fat. I go to the gym 3 times a week for strength training, and do light cardio once or twice a week just to stay active. My goal physique would be to add a little bit of muscle and trim some fat. I don&#8217;t necessarily need peeling abs, but I&#8217;d like to look more athletic than I do now if that makes sense.</p>
<p>What rep ranges do you recommend for someone who just wants to look a little more toned and athletic (in my head I picture what Matthew Mcconaughey looks like)? Or do you have any recommended exercises or routines that I should follow? I know that diet is key for any kind of body composition changes, but I feel like I have that down pat. I just want to get my workouts in line with what my goals are. Maybe I&#8217;m overthinking things?</p>
<p>Love your show and everything you guys do!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9dqChAf0CQ">Lifting From Home</a></b></p>
<p>Tamara says:</p>
<p>Hello! I just love listening to you both. Robb, you have the most well-placed F-bombs. Anyway, I feel like I have my diet where it needs to be. I have been paleo since 2012 but keto for the past 6 months. I enjoy exercising but I do it from home. I have 5-50lb dumbells, a bench, and a pullup bar. Do you know of a good lifting-from-home program or book? I have exhausted my own expertise and would like to change it up. Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. <a href="https://youtu.be/ebcUEsyYJyk">Fats and Protein</a></b></p>
<p>Cole says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb I really appreciate all that you have contributed to society. I recently finished your book Wired To Eat and I have a question in regards to fat and protein. How do I test my reactivity with different fat and protein sources? How many grams of fat or protein do I test with?</p>
<p>Thank you, I appreciate all that your do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. <a href="https://youtu.be/6SJ4QcZqcMU">Can&#8217;t Reach Recommended Calories Per Day</a></b></p>
<p>Josh says:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 45, 165 lbs, 6&#8217;1&#8243;. I workout 3 times a week (hand weights and HIIT). Lean frame and lean muscle which is typical for me (although I&#8217;d like to add more muscle). Minimal body fat thanks to a low-carb Paleo diet (down from 212 lbs). However, when I count up my daily calories, I&#8217;m always short of the recommended for my age/weight at around 1500 calories. I eat to satiation at three meals a day. I never feel hungry and could even skip meals with no problem. I snack on EPIC Bites, but that&#8217;s it. My question is: should I try to force myself to eat more (even though I don&#8217;t want to) to hit my calorie recommendation, or listen to my body and not worry about it?</p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I can see it. All righty. What&#8217;s new?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, this is one of the interesting things about marriage and spending 15, 20 years with someone, it&#8217;s always interesting what the triage and prioritization of important things turns out to be. We&#8217;re different, which is good, which means that we have a different fresh set of eyes always available to look at a challenging scenario in a different way.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, your tie wasn&#8217;t a challenging scenario. I&#8217;m just staring at it, so I just decided to tuck it in and I verbalized it, and now people get to listen to this. So-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Hey, people are always asking me about the inner workings, which I have no idea why.

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Or less so.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8230; our questions?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, totally.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay. Let&#8217;s see, our first question in this week&#8217;s episode is from Christian on arterial plaque buildup. Christian says, &#8220;Hi Robb and Nicki. I was wondering what your opinions were on stopping or reducing arterial plaque buildup. Isn&#8217;t that one of the big reasons we&#8217;re obsessed with things like cholesterol as a society? I know at one point Dr. Rocky Patel had stated he had significant reversal in his carotid artery after a few years of carb cycling. I know this question is an absolute </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">minefield</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> of personable variability. At age 40, and a lifetime of combining things like shitty high omega-6 oils and highly processed carbs, my new goal is to enjoy retirement.&#8221; At 40, that&#8217;s awesome, Christian.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s a good time to decide that you want to live, yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s funny. Retiring at 40, that&#8217;s awesome. &#8220;My blood pressure has crept back up since falling off the low carb, carb cycling wagon at my new job.&#8221; Okay, so maybe you&#8217;re not retired. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really think CBD is in too many branches of my family tree, but I always excelled at bad lifestyle choices. I would love to hear what your current thoughts are on this. I started following you in 2011. Absolutely love your work. The more suggestions I take from you the better my health gets.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Awesome. That&#8217;s cool. Clearly, I wouldn&#8217;t follow any of my recommendations on relationships or spousal interaction. Man, the cardiovascular disease topic is a big deal. It&#8217;s a massive story to unpack. I sit on the board of directors of a lipidology clinic, and this is kind of like &#8230; we&#8217;re earlobe deep in this stuff all the time, and it&#8217;s &#8230; What&#8217;s crazy is billions and billions of dollars have been spent on this, and we still don&#8217;t really have a great story around it. I will diverge a little bit. I&#8217;ve been listening to the human performance outliers podcast with Zach Bitter and Sean Baker, and it&#8217;s great. They had a back to back series of shows with a couple of cardiologists, and that was outstanding.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And what&#8217;s interesting about that is if we go back and look at the efficacy of antibiotics, if you had some sort of a septic event or something like that, infection, sepsis, strep throat, a lot of these things were fatal, and so you could&#8217;ve had a benchmark of, okay, if you have this septic event, 90% of people, 95% of people are going to die. Whereas if you then intervene with antibiotics, something like 98% of people will not die.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So the efficacy was so incredibly powerful, and now we, the health care providers and the drug manufacturers, it&#8217;s still contentious, to some degree, whether or not statins really provide much of any benefit, but to the degree that they provide benefit, it&#8217;s in a tiny cross section of people. It&#8217;s kind of like a wind blowing on you, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh I think that that cooled me,&#8221; versus you&#8217;re on fire and somebody doused you with water or something.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So it&#8217;s fascinating to me that we&#8217;ve spent so much money trying to deal with this problem, and there&#8217;s some benefit that&#8217;s occurred, but without a doubt, diet and lifestyle&#8217;s kind of where the rubber hits the road on all of this. And the best understanding of cardiovascular disease, this vascular occlusion process is that it&#8217;s a multi-factorial element, like LDL, lipoproteins, LDL cholesterol clearly play a role, but Peter Attia was the first person that I heard use this point which was that it&#8217;s necessary but not sufficient for the cardiovascular disease process, and so if you didn&#8217;t have LDL lipoproteins at all, you probably couldn&#8217;t develop cardiovascular disease, the occlusive cardiovascular disease. You would die from all kinds of other stuff, but it&#8217;s a piece that needs to be in the mix, but immune stimulation, blood pressure, non-laminar flow, inflammatory status, blood sugar deltas.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s going on there, and again, there&#8217;s so much going on that sometimes I &#8230; Occasionally, we might even break out, I might do a slide or two ahead of time on some of these things in the future. We&#8217;ll see because more people are watching these things online, so that might be helpful, but &#8230; So, on the one hand, we could have atherosclerotic progression over the course of a lifetime, but so long as we don&#8217;t have a clotting event occur, we&#8217;re not going to die from that. It&#8217;s the clot formation that you know &#8230; and it&#8217;s kind of a combination where the vascular lumen starts shrinking, so a smaller and smaller particle could-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Could cause a clotting event.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8230; could cause a clotting event, but then what&#8217;s interesting within that is that there&#8217;s a pretty good case to be made that most stroke and heart attack events, when there is a clotting event, happens at the tail end of a blood sugar drop. So blood sugar goes high, presumably after a meal, and then when it drops, that causes a pro-inflammatory environment and that that may be a big part of this thing.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So it&#8217;s unclear &#8230; there is material that suggests that vascular occlusion may reverse under circumstances of a low-carb diet. We don&#8217;t remotely have enough data to support that. It&#8217;s incredibly anecdotal, there&#8217;s all this fanfare around the Dean Ornish intervention where they had people stop smoking and they exercised and they meditated and they went on a low fat vegan type diet. But of course the only thing that matters is the vegan diet on that. And something that has to be pointed out in that scenario is that the degree of change, the degree of improvement is smaller than the error of the testing that is used, so it&#8217;s fucking bullshit, but it&#8217;s &#8230; Yeah, man. I&#8217;m all over the map here. Help me, wife. Help me Tom Cruise.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well it sounds like you&#8217;re saying, he&#8217;s at a new job, his eating has kind of slid a little bit, but you&#8217;re saying one of the biggest things you can do is avoid those blood sugar deltas.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So the blood sugar deltas are huge. Blood pressure is huge.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So he said his blood pressure is snuck back up.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay. So we definitely need to address that. And the way that you address that is with, in general, a lower carbohydrate intake, or a modification of the types of carbohydrate. That non-laminar flow where we get turbulence in the vascular system, that&#8217;s where we get plaque formation. We do not, no matter how screwed up people are, even in familial hypercholesterolemia, the veins do not develop atherosclerotic lesions. It&#8217;s the arteries. It&#8217;s the pressurized systems that can damage the vascular lumen, and I hope I&#8217;m right about that, familial hypercholesterolemia, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m &#8230; I still think that only occurs on the arterial side. If I&#8217;m wrong, then I&#8217;ll be crucified and fucking at the stake in the interwebs.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But the point being that the vast majority of vascular atherosclerotic progression happens in the arteries. This is the case for making sure that you get your low dose cardio so that the kind of maffetone pace, because it increases the capillarization throughout the body and that tends to provide more buffering with regards to the laminar flow.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So it&#8217;s funny, again, how low carb</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8211;</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">diets tend to fix a bunch of different problems. It decreases inflammation. It removes the blood glucose delta. It drops blood pressure. So the likelihood of non-laminar flow is less. Now, one of the problems that can arise in that scenario is that LDL lipoproteins can go up, which ostensibly is one of the main factors that can be at play here. One of the doctors that was on this performance outliers podcast mentioned that he would use Zetia occasionally, which is not a statin, but it drops the reabsorption of cholesterol in the gut and so this can drop glycoproteins. And so he&#8217;ll use that as a bridge for some people who are really inflamed, clearly dyslipidemic and insulin resistant and all that, but he&#8217;s a little nervous about the potential of worsening the lipoprotein scenario until their inflammation and blood sugars and all that stuff normalize. So he&#8217;ll use Zetia for a couple of weeks and he feels like that&#8217;s all been good.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Real quickly on the screening that you can do, a CIMT, a carotid intimal media thickness scan which is an ultrasound process, that&#8217;s a great thing to get as a baseline. It doesn&#8217;t really matter so much what that number is. It&#8217;s something that can be easily tracked over time. And this is the thing that I believe Rocky saw, a regression &#8230; or he saw an improvement, where it looked like it was really nasty when he was eating a standard American diet, and then he went cyclic low-carb, doing the carb night, his lipoproteins went to the moon, it was like 3,000 on the LDL particle count, but then his, according to his CIMT, that improved.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There&#8217;s still this question, though, is he free and away? We don&#8217;t really for sure know. There&#8217;s some suggestive things that stuff&#8217;s improved. One of the other important things that folks can use is a coronary calcium scan. Generally, you want a zero. Coronary calcium scan of zero says that currently, there&#8217;s not really cardiovascular atherogenic progression. There&#8217;s some suggestion that we can see improvements on that over time, but again, it&#8217;s &#8230; There&#8217;s error within the readings, and I mean it gets hard to really suss all that out.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do you know, is that something that you can just go to your doctor and say, &#8220;I want this?&#8221; Or you have to already show signs of disease progress?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s the interesting thing. Usually you need to already be sick and then, and this is some of the stuff that these cardiologists were talking about, people will come in &#8230; they&#8217;ll come in with a cardiac event. They have an MI, they survive, they get a stent, they do all that stuff. And then, so long as they&#8217;re motoring along asymptomatically, then their insurance really is reticent to have them go in and be rechecked with the scans. And so then it&#8217;s an out of pocket thing, and this is why I really advocate for some market based signaling within health care system, which we&#8217;ll drop from six listeners to two listeners by throwing that one out there, but yeah this is one of the things &#8230;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You know what, fuck it. I don&#8217;t really care if we drop down to two listeners, at least it&#8217;s the two smart people and not the four fucking dumb people, but if you really want freedom in your food systems, if you really want freedom in the way that you approach medicine and whatnot, and I&#8217;m not saying that there&#8217;s absolutely no social safety nets involved, but things like health savings accounts allow a market based intervention where I can go and pay for a procedure like this and advocate for myself, and then there&#8217;s legitimate transparent market based signaling, the prices tend to come down, people compete. If you look at Lasix, if you look at other elective surgeries like plastic surgery, all that stuff follows these models, but people just freak the fuck out when it&#8217;s health care. But this is part of the problem that we face and I&#8217;ll tell you, the folks in the UK consistently will say, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s really hard, because I would like to get my LDLP checked,&#8221; or, &#8220;I would like to get this checked or that checked.&#8221; And within the NHS system, either that test doesn&#8217;t exist, or they can&#8217;t do it because they&#8217;re not sick enough yet to warrant the thing, so it&#8217;s really, really hard to get in and advocate for yourself under those circumstances.</span></span></span></p>

TJ says, &#8220;I&#8217;m a new listener who absolutely loves your show, so I figured I&#8217;d write in and try to get my question answered. I&#8217;m 5&#8242; 11&#8221;, 180 pounds, 19% body fat, give or take, and I&#8217;m looking to improve my physique. I would describe my look as just a bit more muscular than skinny-fat. I go to the gym three times a week for strength training and do light cardio once or twice a week just to stay active. My goal physique would be to add a little bit of muscle and trim some fat. I don&#8217;t necessarily need peeling abs, but I&#8217;d like to look more athletic than I do now, if it makes sense.</span></span></span></p>

I know that diet is key for any kind of body composition changes, but I feel like I have that down pat. Just want to get my workouts in line with what my goals are. Maybe I&#8217;m overthinking things. Love your show and everything you guys do.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">No, I mean it&#8217;s funny with this stuff, there&#8217;s just a lot of different ways to peel this onion. Almost 10 years ago, I reached out to John Welbourn, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey man, I&#8217;m really busy, can you set up a two day a week template for me?&#8221; And it was basically a vertical press, vertical pole, and then a hinge or a squat, horizontal press, horizontal pole, hinge or a squat or a lunge, and I do three to eight sets of three to five reps. In my opinion, the heavier weight but moving it rapidly, so if I&#8217;m doing some sort of a bench press type movement, I&#8217;ll lower it under control, but then man I really move it because what I&#8217;m trying to do is activate the fast twitch motor fibers even though this is more of an aesthetics question. What is it, form follows function? And so you move weights in an authoritative fashion, if you&#8217;re doing gymnastics and stuff like that, just kind of magical stuff comes out of the weeds with that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So I tend to orient more on the heavier, lower rep side, a little more sets to accumulate the volume, but again &#8230; So you&#8217;ve got three days a week, I can make a case for &#8230; So vertical press can be a barbell press, it could be </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">dumbbell</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> presses, it could be see-saw presses, it could be rotating Cuban presses, there&#8217;s all this variety within that. It could be </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">handstand</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> push-ups. So I do two to four weeks of one movement trying to progress things, so I&#8217;ll hit 24 to 30 total reps on a movement. So if I&#8217;m doing five sets of five, then I&#8217;m right there. If I&#8217;m doing threes, then I do eight to 10 sets of three. And so I&#8217;m getting about the same amount of volume trying to get a weight that&#8217;s heavy, but that I can still move-</span></span></span></p>

You&#8217;re going to burn yourself out. And then I&#8217;ll do two to four weeks of barbell press, and then I&#8217;ll shift to an alternating </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">dumbbell</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> press for that movement. For rowing I will do just TRX or [inaudible 00:17:56] body row for a couple of weeks, and then I may shift to alternating on that, where I&#8217;m trying to emphasize pulling one side or the other, and then I&#8217;ll go to </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">dumbbell</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> rows. And then for horizontal pulling, it&#8217;s neutral grip pull ups, reverse grip pull ups, but you know, pronated pull ups and then occasionally I&#8217;ll just alternate pulling one arm.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So there&#8217;s all this variety and you just tweak the variable a little bit. Squatting and </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">deadlifting</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> I&#8217;m kind of limited because of the back injury, so I get to front squat, I can do some Romanian </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">deadlifts</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">, I can do a little bit of trap bar </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">deadlifts</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> and then I do some weighted hip bridges. So-</span></span></span></p>

And then I use lunging, one legged squats and stuff like that to round stuff out. But that&#8217;s how I do the press, pole, hinge, squat. I would do that two days a week, and then maybe your third day is kind of like del</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">t</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">s, tricep, bicep, calves, abs, go in and do an aesthetics thing and maybe make that day a little bit higher rep, more &#8230; three sets of 10, three sets of 12. I think you could just crush that, and it should be super time</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8211;</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">efficient. You shouldn&#8217;t be in the gym a super long time, and then, again, you pointed out that in the background of this, you should be getting stronger, you should be building some muscle, but then at the end of the day, the leanness is really where you&#8217;re going to see the physique come out.</span></span></span></p>

And then, you can do a row in it, so one that I like to do is a </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">deadlift</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">, and usually I&#8217;ll do five reps, then I&#8217;ll hinge forward, do some rows, then I&#8217;ll stand tall, do some hang power cleans, then some push press, and then I&#8217;ll wrap up with front squats. And so, you could have one day a week of vertical press, vertical pole, a hinge or a squat. The other day, horizontal press, horizontal pole, a hinge or a squat or a lunge, and then you can do a third day that you just set a timer and do complexes. And that&#8217;s a really fun workout and you get great full body integration, like they&#8217;re actually a ton of fun doing those.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Nicki:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Cool. All right. Our next question is from Cole on fats and protein. &#8220;Hey Robb, I really appreciate all that you have contributed to society. I recently finished your book, Wired to Eat, I have question in regard to fat and protein. How do I test my reactivity with different fat and protein sources? How many grams of fat or protein do I test with? Thank you, and I appreciate all you do.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Man, that&#8217;s an interesting question, and Mike Julian, Rick Passmore, Artie Dikeman, a bunch of the dudes that are in the low</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8211;</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">carb scene, but the &#8230; Tyler and Louise. They really ask some great questions around this, and with fat specifically, I remember there was a period of time when we, I was mainly watching because these guys are way fucking smarter than I am, but so we have an oral glucose tolerance test, and they were making the case that we should have an oral lipid tolerance test, where you give people a given lipid like oleic acid or something and you&#8217;d have to figure out how exactly you&#8217;d do this because glucose is just glucose, whereas fats are typically a mix of different lipids. But then how long does it take to clear that? And that there would be some suggestions about how metabolically flexible and healthy you are and all that stuff. Because in the same way that you don&#8217;t want huge amounts of carbohydrate spiking in the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">bloodstream</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> and also hanging out a long time, we really don&#8217;t want huge amounts of lipids in there, too. To my knowledge, other than in University and research settings, nobody really does a lipid clearance test, so I have no idea how you would do that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then on the protein front, I have two thoughts on that. One is more the blood sugar type response. Some people do notice that when they eat a decent whack of protein, that they feel hypoglycemic. So when we eat protein, if it&#8217;s a legit chunk of protein, we should release insulin to allow sequestering the amino acids into cells. But we also release glucagon which generally should give you a little bit more of a bump in blood glucose than what you drop from the insulin release.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now some people that maybe have pancreatic problems from inflammation, they&#8217;re almost like a type one and a half diabetic, some of these people will notice that they have some blood sugar dysregulation as a result of eating protein as an isolated source. Not super common and there are some things that can be done to try to mitigate that, but again, I&#8217;m not really too sure. This is more of a diagnostic of when things have-</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So this is the other piece is the immunogenic side.</span></span></span></p>

Do you have a rapid heart rate?&#8221; Like all this other stuff. So there&#8217;s potentially the immunogenic piece, and then also the blood sugar piece. But I would say those are &#8230; they&#8217;re rare. They&#8217;re really out in the weeds, it&#8217;s kind of the last 2% of people or something like that, I don&#8217;t know what the real number is, but Cole, really good questions, but on the lipid clearance story, there&#8217;s just not easy ways to do that. It&#8217;s not generally done. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s something that is done more in the future, and then on the protein front, unless we are experiencing overt hypoglycemic symptoms as a consequence of eating a protein, then we start asking some questions around, &#8220;Is pancreatic function on point and/or do we have an immunogenic response?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>

I eat to satiation at three meals a day. I never feel hungry and I could even skip meals with no problem. I snack on Epic Bites, but that&#8217;s it. My question is, should I force myself to eat more even though I don&#8217;t want to to hit my calorie recommendation, or listen to my body and not worry about it?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>

This is the place where, let&#8217;s see you&#8217;re eating three whole meals a day, it&#8217;s low</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8211;</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">carb paleo, this is the spot where a bullet proof coffee or a bunch of whole cream in coffee, this is where the liquid calories can be valuable. I remember when I was &#8230; we were both into Olympic weight lifting and I was trying to add some body weight and this is where I would do three cans of coconut milk a day and do curries and just eat that whole thing.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Robb:</b></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Now, it was a lot, and I definitely wasn&#8217;t hungry very often and all that type of stuff, but each one of the cans of coconut milk alone was 1,000 calories, so I got 3,000 calories just in the background right there. Plus the protein and fad and the veggies or whatever, little bits of fruit and stuff like that that I was doing. So I was like 3,800 calories, no more that that, it was like 4,200 calories, now that I think about it.</span></span></span></p>

So this is the place for some liquid calories, adding some coconut oil or some butter or more olive oil to the meals. You&#8217;ve just got to add more liquid calories. This might be a case for adding more sweet potatoes or yams or something because with a little more carbs, you tend to be a little hungrier. And so you have an opportunity to eat a bit more.</span></span></span></p>

Which is, I think, part of what you&#8217;re experiencing. But you also may not need quite as many calories as what you think to be able to gain some muscle mass over time.</span></span></span></p>

Like he&#8217;s six one, 165 pounds, that&#8217;s &#8230; I&#8217;m five nine and 165-</span></span></span></p>

But you really make a goal, look at your standing press, bench press, weighted pull up, </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">deadlift</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> squat, and set some incremental goals. Add 50 pounds to both your squat and </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">deadlift</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> over a six month period. Add 25 pounds to your bench and your standing press over a six month period. Greg Glassman had a saying like that. Like, &#8220;Get to where you could clean and jerk your body weight 21 times. Do 40 dead hang pull ups, blah, blah, blah, and then get back to me about what your physique is like.&#8221; And it&#8217;s kind of like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s true.&#8221; This is again where the form follows function kind of deal.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you DREAD ice baths but power through in the sake of recovery? Or maybe you’ve considered doing them but are too scared to dip your little toe in a tub as cold as Antarctica… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this week’s 10 and 2 Q I go into the research on hydrotherapy for training recovery. As well as, the alternative: HEAT! Saunas… </span></p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="555" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0OL51Msl0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Depending on your personal preference, heat and cold therapies have research backing both of their benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you do cold therapy, I recommend not doing it soon after your training if you really want to see the benefits of your therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1"><strong>Transcript:</strong><br />
</span></em><span class="s1">Nicki: Robb, what do think about all of the cold water immersion stuff, and the popularity of people jumping in ice baths and whatnot?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Robb: Hydrotherapy and everything? It&#8217;s good stuff. I mean, it&#8217;s definitely cool. The thing about the ice baths, in particular &#8230; If you do it post-workout, it appears to blunt the adaptation for the workout. If you&#8217;re a CrossFit Games competitor and you need to &#8230; or some sort of high-level competitor and you need to be ready to go again quickly, and you don&#8217;t really have time to allow the normal inflammatory process to occur in between a training session, then I could see the benefit. But the point of training is not really the training, it&#8217;s the adaptation that occurs. This cold immersion can really shut that down. It appears to be somewhat similar to taking NSAIDs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Robb: It&#8217;s funny, physical activity, the adaptation that occurs with that is more in the heat shock protein family versus the cold shock protein families, which all of these things are hormetic stress responses. All of them have great benefit. But the heat shock proteins are more specific to actual physical activity. So I could make a case, and maybe it&#8217;s just my bias because I don&#8217;t actually like cold water immersion too much. Nicki likes it better than I do. But I would rather a sauna, a hot immersion, than a cold one. I kind of feel like even if I did a hard weight training session, if I did a hard jiu-jitsu session and then I do heat exposure, I just feel better after that. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m sure that, again, the poison&#8217;s in the dose on all that stuff. I think there&#8217;s benefits to both sides of this temperature extreme exposure. There&#8217;s clear research that supports that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Robb: But, I guess at being almost 50 and I&#8217;ve done a lot of stuff in my life because I thought I should do it, and now I look at what are some things that are potentially beneficial? Cold immersion, heat exposure. Okay. I fucking hate cold immersion so I&#8217;m not doing the exposure. So there&#8217;s a little bit of personal bias on that. But I think also just something to keep in mind, again, is if you are doing the cold exposure, you probably want to get it as far away from physical activity as you can, maybe even hours before versus hours afterwards. Because it&#8217;s that after time that, again, is when the adaptation occurs. But I could also chalk a fair amount of this up to just kind of personal preference.</span></p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> [<i>1:47</i>] <b><a href="https://youtu.be/bFhMu2HISZI">How To Fuel For Overtraining</a> </b></p>
<p>Patrick says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb,</p>
<p>I have a question for you about how to best balance the three main things in my life; eating, training and working. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;ve gotten sick about a million times in 2018, and had some challenges in maintaining a work &#8211; training balance. Every time that I feel healthy and ready to kill it, I immediately begin to overtrain &#8211; and I know this is a sentiment that many share, especially when the over training symptoms take a little while to build up and express themselves. &nbsp;My susceptibility to over training is mainly brought on by my work&#8217;s early start times. I am 30 years old and a Builder and wake at 5:30, have moderately intense exercise over 8-9 hours during the day, an hour commute home and then training (BJJ, gii and no gi. Sometimes I try to fit in some striking) from 6-7:30 or to 8:30 if I feel I can get away with it, however eating late and needing to sleep around 9:30-10pm is really difficult for me. &nbsp;Metabolism is working too much at night and it affects my body temperature and HRV. I try to delay breakfast until 9am (to achieve 12 hours window) with either a bulletproof or just straight black coffee after wakeup .</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the option of training during the day unfortunately. Some of the over training symptoms I&#8217;ve had have been IBS type, adrenal stress and then the associated depressive mood when in a slump. &nbsp;Most of this gets fixed up by implementing a &#8216;less is more approach&#8217; to training. Also experience some afternoon slumps.</p>
<p>What would be a good strategy to fuel all this activity, fuelling for both energy load during the day and training at night, plus recovery after training. &nbsp;Also things to note I&#8217;m really low body fat, really high percentage muscle, metabolism chews up all my food quick as and can get hypoglycaemic sometimes.</p>
<p>Thanks from Australia!!</p>
<p>Patrick and Georgia!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 2. </b>[<i>8:04</i>]<a href="https://youtu.be/boP4_0Frak4"><b> Physical Sustainability of BJJ</b></a></p>
<p>Kent says:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering what the long term implications are of a regular BJJ practice. It&#8217;s always something I&#8217;ve wanted to explore, but it seems like many folks who have practiced consistently for years have developed joint issues, tears, etc. Is this simply inevitable? What are your thoughts on the long term sustainability? I&#8217;m not talking about someone who is wanting to seriously compete, but someone like yourself who enjoys the physical nature of the practice. My apologies in advance if you&#8217;ve already answered this question and I missed it! Thanks for all that you do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 3. </b>[<i>13:12</i>]<a href="https://youtu.be/ec06GUFc10o"><b> Vitamin D Lights???</b></a></p>
<p>Alli says:</p>
<p>Hi Robb and Nicki&#8230; I’ve been a follower of yours for years and I considered myself Paleo BUT I would pick and choose. &nbsp;This past May I decided to buy in 100% and I purchased your Keto Masterclass which changed my life. I’ve lost 40 pounds but more important is that for the first time in my life I am in control of my food. &nbsp;Life changing. And now that I’m on a roll I’m trying to implement more positive life changing choices.</p>
<p>My question relates to Vitamin D synthesis in the cold Connecticut fall and winter. &nbsp;I’m trying to get outside as much as possible but exposing skin just isn’t feasible. I know that sunlight is preferable to supplementing BUT how about those happy &nbsp;lights? Do they work? Will a $40 one work or do I need the expensive one? Could you recommend one? If they don’t work- what dosage of Vit D should I aim for from a supplement?</p>
<p>Thank you for doing what you do.</p>
<p>Alli</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 4. </b>[<i>19:37</i>]<a href="https://youtu.be/yuiAIzuLzxM"><b> Supplements from China</b></a></p>
<p>Gregor says:</p>
<p>I often buy online some supplements bulk &#8211; at least 1-2 lbs. This way they are way cheaper. I use magnesium citrate, garlic powder, turmeric powder, collagen any some other. What worries me is that many of then have China as country of origin and we know how devastated environment is in parts of China.</p>
<p>Shall I be worried by Chinese origin? Can magnesium citrate from China be contaminated with something? Shall I choose more expensive stuff, but with other origin (Americas, Europe)?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for looking into that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b> 5. </b>[<i>21:10</i>]<a href="https://youtu.be/zbLbgTM827g"><b> Protein &amp; Thermal Effect</b></a></p>
<p>Drew says:</p>
<p>Does powdered protein (specifically whey, if that makes a difference) have the same thermal/metabolic effect as eating steak/chicken/pork/eggs/etc?</p>
<p>I have listen to every single podcast. Love it all! Thanks for doing everything you do!</p>

So we tried to do this one last week?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Last week.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And somehow we screwed it up.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I didn&#8217;t hit the right button, and so it recorded video only with no audio. So we&#8217;re doing this one again.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">No good deed goes unpunished as they say, somebody says.</span></span></span></p>

I don&#8217;t know who would say that. Man, definitely keep this as small as possible, so it&#8217;s hard for you to read while we&#8217;re doing this. Don&#8217;t make it easy on you.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You always blow things up, so it&#8217;s like a 90-year-old could read it.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, and then that way when you&#8217;re 90 years old, you don&#8217;t actually need any reading accoutrements to be able to do it. So we should probably get out of the house more often and see other people, but welcome back. Thank you.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All right, let&#8217;s jump into this first question from Patrick. He has a diet question from a blue belt at night, builder during the day. Hi, Robb. I have a question for you about how to best balance the three main things in my life — eating, training, and working. I&#8217;ve gotten sick about a million times in 2018 and had some challenges in maintaining a work-training balance. Every time that I feel healthy and ready to kill it, I immediately begin to over-train. I know this is a sentiment that many share, especially when the overtraining symptoms take a little while to build up and express themselves. My susceptibility to over-training is mainly brought on by my work&#8217;s early start times.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m 30 years old and a builder, awake at 5:30, have moderately intense exercise over eight to nine hours during the day, an hour commute home, and then training, BJJ gi and no gi. Sometimes I also try to fit in some striking from 6:00 to 7:30 or to 8:30 if I feel like I can get away with it. However, eating late and needing to sleep around 9:30 to 10:00 is really difficult for me. Metabolism is working too much at night, and it affects my body temperature and heart rate variability. I try to delay breakfast until 9:00 AM to achieve 12-hour window with either Bulletproof or just straight black coffee after wake up.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I don&#8217;t have the option of training during the day unfortunately. Some of the overtraining symptoms I&#8217;ve had have been IBS type, adrenal stress, and then the associated depressive mood when in a slump. Most of this gets fixed up by implementing a less is more approach to training. Also experience some afternoon slumps. What would be a good strategy to fuel all this activity for both energy load during the day and training at night plus recovery? Also, quick things to note, I&#8217;m really low body fat, really high percentage muscle, metabolism chews up all my food quick as and can get hypoglycemic sometimes.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, that was smooth.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There&#8217;s a word missing there.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So I had a very detailed response last time. This is the problem of screwing up podcasts because you feel like, man, I gave a really good response the first time and I&#8217;m not entirely sure if I can pull that together on the second one. But the things that we talked about, definitely you might just need to pick &#8230; Are you doing Jits or not? Not so much Jits or not, but adding in Muay Thai on top of that and then the short sleep, that&#8217;s just a disaster, man. That is just begging for problems. I would try to dial down the intensity of the training as much as possible, try to get fat and lazy and efficient.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Your goal in Jiu-Jitsu, in my opinion, should be to get out of shape because you&#8217;re so lazy and efficient with it. This flies in the face of the way that most people train, most schools&#8217; philosophies. People just go, go, go, and make it a very anaerobic intense sport. I try to do the opposite and try to make it relaxed and gentle and weight-centric. So depending on the type of school you go to and the type of game you have, that may be a big change. I would check out Henry Akins Hidden Jiu-Jitsu online stuff, even if you just buy one module. I think he has the Bali course that actually shows him rolling with the students, so you get a bunch of awesome material and then you see him rolling. When you see how lazy and efficient this guy is, but he just absolutely destroys people, it&#8217;s a pretty good wake up call for what&#8217;s going into that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So you asked about fueling though, you didn&#8217;t ask about training. But the training piece is really important. The fueling, I would try front loading more of the calories earlier in the day. I would go maybe as much as much as 50% of your whole day&#8217;s calories at breakfast and then maybe 30% at lunch and then maybe 20% for dinner. If you could front load even more of that, that would be great. The challenge is that you put &#8230; So here&#8217;s an example. I forget who I was talking to recently, but they were talking about how to undo hypothermia in people. You get super cold, your body temperature has dropped. Clearly putting them in a warm environment, putting warm clothes on, and all that is effective.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But if you don&#8217;t have access to things like that or limited access, one of the best things that you can do is eat and eat as much as you can because it will absolutely raise your body temperature, both from the caloric content of the food entering your system but also just from the physical, chemical breakdown of food will elevate your body temperature. For you to get into deep effective sleep, you need your body temperature to drop. So doing a big meal post-training can be really problematic, but at the same time, any type of fasting and stuff like that can be a challenge. So maybe that 12-hour fast is okay. If that&#8217;s fitting into your schedule, that&#8217;s probably fine. But I definitely wouldn&#8217;t push it much more than that, particularly given how lean you are and the activity level. What else? There was one other thing I want to say we touched on?</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think we mentioned taking a cold shower before bed.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yes, cold shower and/or this thing called a chilly pad, which is a blanket type thing that you put on your mattress-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Like a mattress pad.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A mattress pad, and it actually has tubes that go down to a little water pump and you can heat or cool it. It&#8217;s great for marriages because if one person&#8217;s cold and one person&#8217;s warm, then you can adjust both sides for that appropriately. But the cold shower, cold room, dark, all that sleep hygiene stuff plus potentially a chilly pad.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Well, and Patrick, you also say most of this all gets fixed up by implementing a less is more approach, so it sounds like you have a sense of-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You know what to do.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8230; What kicks you over the edge and what doesn&#8217;t. One thing Robb talks about a lot is just longevity in anything, especially in Jiu-Jitsu. Maybe dialing it back and just taking a little bit of a slower pace might help you get all that you want out of it, but not enter into this over-training state.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yes, we&#8217;ll wrap up there. I was going to try to wax eloquent, but I will neither wax nor be eloquent.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All right, our next question is from Kent on the physical sustainability of BJJ. Kent says, &#8220;I&#8217;m wondering what the long-term implications are of regular BJJ practice. It&#8217;s always something I&#8217;ve wanted to explore, but it seems like many folks who&#8217;ve practiced consistently for years have developed joint issues, tears, et cetera. Is this simply inevitable? What are your thoughts on the long-term sustainability? I&#8217;m not talking about someone who is wanting to seriously compete, but someone like yourself who enjoys the physical nature of the practice. My apologies in advance if you&#8217;ve already answered this question and I missed it, thanks for all you do.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We did answer it, but it didn&#8217;t get recorded.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">No, we answered it four days ago.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, and we did a pretty good job on it as I recollect with that. So the short answer is it is not an inevitable thing that you&#8217;re going to get injured doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, not any more so — and I would suspect probably less so — than soccer or basketball. I forget, the greatest injury rate in the military is pickup basketball or something like that. More people get injured, there&#8217;s more downtime from pickup basketball in the military than all other military activities or something like that. So Jiu-Jitsu is a contact sport. There is injury potential, but a couple of things with that.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If you&#8217;re a knucklehead and you don&#8217;t tap at the appropriate time, you&#8217;re going to get hurt. So tap early, tap often. Our coach, John Frankel, makes the case that you&#8217;ve got to love Jiu-Jitsu more than winning. What that means is that you get in and when somebody gets you, that&#8217;s a repetition. You think about, oh, how did they get that arm bar? How did they get that choke? You start trying to retro-engineer that, what you need to do to be able to intervene early to be able to deal with that. If somebody&#8217;s going super hard, you either communicate with them to dial it down or you figure out a way of mitigating that stuff.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A lot of it is the vibe of your school and your training partners too. If you&#8217;re in a place where everybody is going for bear and I&#8217;m going to tap you by hook or by crook, then the likelihood of injury is probably higher. If you&#8217;re in a school where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s my arm. What can I do to get out of this?&#8221; and you&#8217;re okay being in those positions and tapping and not always coming out on top, you&#8217;re going to learn a lot more. Your likelihood of injury is probably less.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Some of the big injury points, like joints of the hand, the fingers &#8230; If you do a really grip intensive game, like if you&#8217;re grabbing sleeves and you&#8217;re grabbing pants and stuff like that, one, I would make the case that it&#8217;s a dead end process. You actually don&#8217;t get as good at Jiu-Jitsu as what you would otherwise get. Two, it really can damage your hands pretty severely.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">There are people that tape all their fingers up just to train because their hands are so-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, people do this as a badge of honor. They go sit down and they spend 30 minutes taping their fucking hands. It&#8217;s like in my opinion, again, and there&#8217;s lots of opinion around this, it&#8217;s not good Jiu-Jitsu. Overhooks, underhooks. Instead of grabbing sleeve, I&#8217;m doing more no gi stuff, whether I&#8217;m wearing a gi or not. We wear a gi most the time because I&#8217;m just comfortable in it, but my gi and no gi game are virtually identical. The only difference is occasionally I choke people with their gi, and somebody tries or does choke me with my gi. Other tha</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">n</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> that, my gi and no gi games are virtually identical. Then what was &#8230; We had one other piece of this.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Oh, just looking at something called Kinstretch.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, Kinstretch.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The folks who do functional range conditioning, Dr Andreo Spina up in Toronto. Then he has several of his coaches that offer Kinstretch. It&#8217;s amazing. We haven&#8217;t experienced something like this before. It&#8217;s basically strengthening in your end range. So in Jiu-Jitsu, frequently you are in an end range position when you&#8217;re about to tap, so it&#8217;s helping to keep those tissues healthy, keeping them strong in their end range, so hopefully your likelihood of injury is significantly less.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, I&#8217;m glad you remembered that. Then one other thought, and this is going to make some people angry, but the grips are a big deal for injury in Jiu-Jitsu. The other thing that&#8217;s super catastrophic is the neck and inverted games where people are spinning around, upside down, inverted. I know it&#8217;s super popular in modern Jiu-Jitsu. There are people that do it really, really well. There are a lot of people that get seriously, seriously broken from it, particularly if you are a little bit of a smaller person and you are weight-bearing under that inverted load. I just think it&#8217;s super dodgy. It has limited application from a self</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8211;</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">defense standpoint. Orthopedically, I think it&#8217;s a disaster. I know I&#8217;m going to get a bunch of people that absolutely hate me on that, but &#8230;</span></span></span></p>

Hi, Robb and Nicki. I&#8217;ve been a follower of yours for years and considered myself paleo, but I would pick and choose. This past May, I decided to buy in 100% and I purchased your keto master class, which changed my life. I&#8217;ve lost 40 pounds, but more important is that for the first time in my life, I am in control of my food. Life changing.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Pretty cool.</span></span></span></p>

My question relates to vitamin D synthesis in the cold Connecticut fall and winter. I&#8217;m trying to get outside as much as possible, but exposing skin just isn&#8217;t feasible. I know that sunlight is preferable to supplementing, but how about those happy lights? Do they work? Will a 40 dollar one work or do I need the expensive one? Could you recommend one? If they don&#8217;t work, what dosage of vitamin D should I aim for from a supplement? Thank you.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think when we answered this last time, I tackled the supplement first. I would recommend some sort of ADK supplement, like Carlson&#8217;s. They have some great drops. Vitamin D causes the body to retain calcium. Vitamin K too tells the body where to put it. You don&#8217;t want to retain a bunch of calcium and have it end up in your vascular bed. That&#8217;s bad. So if you&#8217;re going to supplement, that&#8217;s a good way to go. The amounts really vary. Some people do one 10,000 or 20,000 IU dose every 20 days or something, some people dose daily. I would just recommend getting a baseline blood value.</span></span></span></p>

Bill Lagakos posted. If you guys don&#8217;t follow Bill Lagakos, he&#8217;s an amazing guy. He has a Patreon account, I would check him out. His stuff is so on point, super legit, really in the circadian biology, ketogenic diet scene. He&#8217;s really on point, so I can&#8217;t recommend Bill&#8217;s stuff enough. But he did a breakdown of the study that was really interesting. They put about 20 people through a tanning bed experience and they did a crossover, which was really interesting. One group of people got exposed to bright light that had UV in it that would produce vitamin D and all the opioid release associated with light exposure. The other one was bright light, but no UV. Then they would cross folks over, so that that would figure out here&#8217;s my experience of A, here&#8217;s my experience of B. 95% of the people [crosstalk 00:15:00].</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then they got to choose, and 95% of the people chose &#8230;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The one with UV.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The one with UV, which was interesting. The 5% of the people that didn&#8217;t choose the UV, when they checked them for their response to opiates, they were paradoxical responsers to opiates, so they don&#8217;t really get that happy feeling from sunshine. So maybe all these people were from Seattle or something.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">They&#8217;re in Seattle.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I don&#8217;t know when they ever feel happy. But I followed up on that, asking Bill, &#8220;Hey, man. So all of the literature surrounding tanning beds seems to paint it in a pretty poor light. It&#8217;s like, &#8216;Oh, increased melanoma risk, increased melanoma risk.'&#8221; None of these things though ask a &#8230; I have never found a study that looked at how long are people in the tanning bed. It&#8217;s always just kind of like do you do it or do you not do it. For the vast majority of people, when they do tanning, it&#8217;s like trying to be a leather handbag. They really fucking go for bear on that. So is there a case for doing a one-minute exposure, a two-minute exposure? It is definitely far more intense than the light that we get from the sun, but Bill&#8217;s thought on this was interesting.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Again, not medical advice. We&#8217;re just trying to figure out what the story is with this stuff. But he made the case that there&#8217;s slowly a backpedaling within the dermatology scene that being out in the sun is safe. They&#8217;re slowly starting to backpedal on that because it&#8217;s so crystal clear, that circadian biology is critical. Everything else we have going on, it&#8217;s just impossible to have good blood glucose status and to sleep normally and to have good body composition if you don&#8217;t have good circadian biology. Part of good circadian biology is getting some sort of sun on your skin, so some of light on your skin. So he thinks that that&#8217;s going to backpedal from the sun exposure.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then he agreed that he would be hard-pressed to imagine that there shouldn&#8217;t be a protocol for a very brief one-minute exposure. You do that three times a week for one week and then maybe a two-minute exposure, and maybe you cap it off at three, four minutes. You&#8217;re not necessarily using it specifically as a tanning implementation, but as a means of producing vitamin D, which can happen very quickly under those circumstances and just circadian entrainment. So the happy lights, the seasonal affective disorder lights can help with circadian entrainment, but that does not produce vitamin D, but there are some desk-mounted units that you can &#8230; I found it on Amazon that same day that I read Bill&#8217;s paper, that you can get some UV exposure to your chest. You still have to wear the goggles, but you can move it around to get some point UV exposure.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Could you make the case &#8230; She&#8217;s working on implementing more positive life</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8211;</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">changing choices. Although getting out in the morning when it&#8217;s freezing in Connecticut and just having the daylight in her eyes, even if she&#8217;s bundled up with a scarf and a jacket-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">That&#8217;s big, that&#8217;s big.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If she sits out there with her coffee, just to get that-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">As long as you can.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It might not produce vitamin D, but at least it&#8217;s helping the circadian entrainment.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s helping on circadian entrainment for sure, yeah. Even on an overcast day, it is generally far, far brighter outside than anything we experience inside.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Even if you live in a super cold climate, as much as you can, spend some time outside instead of staying bubbled in indoors the whole time.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Absolutely, yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s see, our next question is on supplements from China from [Grigor 00:18:50]. I often buy online supplements in bulk, at least one to two pounds as they are way cheaper. I use magnesium citrate, garlic powder, turmeric powder, collagen, and some others. What worries me is that many of them have China as the country of origin, and we know how devastated the environment is in parts of China. Should I be worried by the Chinese origin? Can magnesium citrate from China be contaminated with something? Shall I choose more expensive stuff but with another origin, like the Americas or Europe? Thanks in advance.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So I think we had a good answer on this one, but I&#8217;m blanking on what it was.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think you said that, yes, you can get lots of dodgy things.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You definitely can get lots of dodgy things. I think Examine just did a piece on this where they looked at &#8230; Either Examine or someone else. A lot of supplements had a lot of really nasty stuff in it, so I would look at an outfit like Thorn or Source Naturals, Garden of Life-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jaro.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Jaro, some of these more reputable companies, and go through that because you can get therapeutic dose of lead from some of this stuff. So I think that it would &#8230; I would spend a little more money for a-</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Especially for something you&#8217;re taking &#8230; You&#8217;re taking it daily, so if you don&#8217;t know what all the little &#8230; Everything that&#8217;s in i</span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">t</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">, that could build up pretty quickly.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, so I think that I would spend a little extra money on that. Short answer. Short question, short answer.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nicki: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All right. Our last question this week is from Drew on protein and thermal effect. Drew says, &#8220;Does powdered protein, specifically whey if that makes a difference, have the same thermal metabolic effect as eating a steak, chicken, pork, eggs, et cetera? I&#8217;ve listened to every single podcast, love it all, thank you for everything you do.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Robb: </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Cool, thanks. So the short answer is protein powders do not have the same thermic effect as whole protein sources. This is some of the benefit of just eating whole, unprocessed foods. That said, protein has a greater thermic effect than either carbohydrate or fat. But you are not going to get as significant a thermic effect off of protein powder. There&#8217;s a ton of reasons why we tend to steer people towards whole, unprocessed foods. There&#8217;s this [inaudible 00:21:10] piece, there&#8217;s this thermic effect piece. This was really coolly validated when I started hanging out with Tyler and Louise from Ketogains, which they get amazing body composition changes on people. Although they will use shakes occasionally, it&#8217;s very sparing and they really hold people&#8217;s feet to the fire to use whole, unprocessed foods because they get generally a better outcome with that. Anything else?</span></span></span></p>

It was much longer-</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Show Notes:</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> [<em>1:43</em>]<b> Lake vs Chlorinated Pool?</b></p>
<p>Jocie says:</p>
<p>Hope you and Nicki do another Q&amp;A soon, those are my favorites!</p>
<p>Heading towards summer- I&#8217;m wondering what your opinion is on lake vs typical chlorinated pool for summer fun? &nbsp;Our family opted for the lake last summer, and it was beautiful but between the dead fish and the posted high fecal count, I was more than a little grossed out. &nbsp;There is a lot of talk about kids growing up healthier when they are exposed to more dirt and germs, but what about things that can mess you over like parasites and giardia? &nbsp;The chlorinated pool is looking better this year!</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> [<em>4:12</em>]<b> Keto &amp; Endurance (specifically running)</b></p>
<p>Rick says:</p>
<p>Hey Robb and Nicki,</p>
<p>Thanks for the Q&amp;A episodes &#8211; they&#8217;ve been super fun. I&#8217;m writing to ask you a question about running when I&#8217;m on Keto. I&#8217;m 45 y/o, male, 6&#8217;0&#8243;, 235lbs, roughly 30% BF. I&#8217;m trying to lose some weight as the primary goal, but I love running too. My ideal workout regimen is to lift 2x per week, full body barbell-type stuff, and run 3-4 times, with runs anywhere from 4-10 miles. I&#8217;ve never been fast, but I&#8217;ve got pretty decent endurance.</p>
<p>Keto seems to be the absolute best way to lose weight, but I find that my runs really tank. I use a HR meter, and I go about a minute per mile slower and my HR is 10-20 beats per minute higher. The longest I&#8217;ve been able to maintain keto is about 5 weeks, and the main reason I fall off the wagon is this. While I&#8217;m not weighing and measuring, I am more or less following the suggestions from the Masterclass and Ketogains, and I&#8217;m focusing on getting enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>So what do you think is going on? Do I just have to keep plugging? Is it possible I&#8217;m not meant to run while keto? How can I speed adaptation? Lots of short slow runs? Fast runs? Slog it out for long and slow? Any advice you have would be fantastic.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> [<em>8:26</em>]<b> Carbs for Endurance Once Fat Adapted?</b></p>
<p>Brian says:</p>
<p>Robb love your insight, 47 year old cyclist typically the last guy on Earth touting low carb eating regiment, but ive been Keto over a year and have seen performance increase against my age. I presume my body has undergone a metabolic shift in fuel source, its working for me! my question is should us endurance guys still carb load to have glucose present in long events or should calorie consumption prior to long events stay parallel to our every day eating regimnet? In others words once this metabolic shift occurs in the macro perspective of ones nutrition is it assumed that the best fuel choice during ultra events should be the same? Would re-introducing glucose be a safety net or waste of calories in your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> [<em>14:01</em>]<b> High Fasting Blood Glucose on Low Carb/Keto Diet</b></p>
<p>Heather says:</p>
<p>HI Robb &amp; Nikki!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a HUGE fan and appreciate all of the knowledge and insight you share on the podcast and everywhere else you show up. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I have eaten low-carb/keto/paleo-ish for several years now, and have done really well. I probably get less than 100g carbs/day (more like 50g), and eat an average of 100g protein/day (grassfed meat, bone broth protein, whey protein smoothies, nuts/seeds, pastured eggs, mackerel/sardines, and occasionally chicken). My fat intake is probably 90-100g/day. I am 43 yrs old, 5&#8217;4 at 118lbs with less than 20% body fat. I go on long walks daily, weight train 3/week, and throw some HITT training along with boxing in the mix. I used to be a spinning instructor and spent hours and hours on the bike each week, but haven&#8217;t taught in 4 yrs and now only power walk for &#8220;cardio&#8221; outside of interval training at the gym. I have two kids, ages 4 &amp; 8, so they keep me busy as well!</p>
<p>I recently (as in 2 weeks ago) bought a blood glucose meter after giving in to my curiosity as to just what my fasting BG is, along with post-prandial, post exercise, etc. I was shocked and so upset when I took my first reading one morning and it was 106!!! Since then I&#8217;ve been rather obsessed and am pricking my finger all day long! LOL! But really no matter if i&#8217;m fasted, just went on a long walk or weight training session, or even 2 hrs after a meal, my blood glucose is always somewhere btwn 90-110&#8211;I never get a big swing upward after a meal, even after I indulged in gf German Chocolate cake the other night! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It has only gone as low as 83 or 87 on two, random occasions, which is making me wonder, &#8220;What the heck?!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read different things online about this, but I really don&#8217;t know who to trust other than you. Could it be cortisol? Could that be my norm? I was expecting my FBG to be around 70-80 based on my diet and activity level. Please advise! I&#8217;m so confused!! Thank you SO MUCH for all you do!!!!! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> [<em>18:21</em>]<b> Reliability of Glucose Meters</b></p>
<p>Pedro says:</p>
<p>Dear Robb</p>
<p>My name is Pedro Escudeiro and I am portuguese. I have been following your work through interviews and your online publications and books. I take many notes from your teachings and have been applying them in my own life, which I deeply thank. However, a few issues have arised especially concerning the use of glucometers to measure blood glucose, for metabolic control (fortunately I have no diseases). I would like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>For a year now that I use regularly a Freestyle Precision Neo device and the readings are not reliable at all. I have made many experiments, such as trying to prick my fingers 5 times in a row to observe the results. The readings are always different, sometimes 15 or more points (mg/dL). I have done the carb test as well, reproducing the same conditions and the readings also change if I test a few times and in different days. I have tried different devices too. I contacted the company to expose this issue and they told me that it is acceptable a variation of 20 points. Being so, it basically means we can&#8217;t rely on this method to inform us on how the body is reacting to foods or to check glucose stability, for example, because it is always changing within the same conditions. I wonder if you have noticed this same issue and if you found a method to overcome this unreliability.</p>
<p>I have used also a Freestyle Libre device, which measures continually the glucose (interstitial fluid) I know there is a delay between the readings and the actual glucose level and there is also less precision than a blood glucometer. However, the same issue of unreliability is happening. The profile of the Libre does not have any match with the blood glucometer or even any correlation, one might be going up and the other down and later one changes and the other doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Since glucose levels are so important for health and performance, if the best method to check it is not reliable and trustworthy at all, it makes all the assumptions and decisions about our health, not just worthless but somehow dangerous. I wonder if you have any thoughts on this.</p>
<p>I hope I am not taking too much of your time and I thank you in advance.</p>
<p>My best wishes,</p>
<p>Pedro</p>

I&#8217;m reading the Wings of Fire series to Zooey and we&#8217;re on the third book and it&#8217;s about the RainWing dragons who live in the rain forest, and they recharge by sleeping for many, many hours in the sun. I find myself wishing that I was a RainWing dragon.</span></span></span></p>

All right. I guess we&#8217;ll jump into the first question.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yep.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s see. Question one is from Josie, and she says, &#8220;I hope you and Nicki do another Q&amp;A soon. These are my favorites. It&#8217;s heading towards summer and I&#8217;m wondering what your opinion is on lake versus typical chlorinated pool for summer fun. Our family opted for the lake last summer and it was beautiful, but between the dead fish and the posted high fecal count, I was more than a little grossed out. There is a lot of talk about kids growing up healthier when they are exposed to more dirt and germs, but what about things that can mess you over like parasites and Giardia? The chlorinated pool is looking better this year.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Man, that&#8217;s a tough one. That&#8217;s kind of why &#8230; and this doesn&#8217;t answer the question specifically, but, like, going to the ocean, and now the ocean you can get, like, fecal contamination there. But in general, if the stuff gets &#8230; dilute enough, most of the bacteria that would be problematic is killed. It doesn&#8217;t really live in the saltwater that effectively. But, I don&#8217;t know, this is &#8230; Lakes are great, I guess. I don&#8217;t know.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I don&#8217;t know. We grew up going to a lot of &#8230; we grew up doing both. Like, we&#8217;d go to the lake as frequently as we could, and then we&#8217;d &#8230; I mean, it was Brandy Creek, Whiskeytown Lake had Brandy Creek, which I&#8217;m sure has fairly high fecal count.</span></span></span></p>

When we grew up, I don&#8217;t know that that stuff did quite the way that it does now. Like, populations have just grown, and people are just dumb, and dirty. &#8220;Well, shit, Billy Bob. Let&#8217;s go take a dump in the creek here.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You think moreso than-</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. I mean, just some of those areas were pretty remote.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We also had a pretty gross experience at the kiddie pool at one of the local pools here in Reno. I won&#8217;t say exactly what we found floating in it.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, you could say it like that.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ugh &#8230; Yeah, it was horrible.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, in, like, the three-foot water kiddie pool. So I think you&#8217;re kind of-</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Kind of damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t. Now, in that scenario, in theory, the chlorinated water killed everything in there at least. But, ugh, yeah. Yeah, definitely the big win is to have a pool in your backyard basically.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Oh, man.

And make sure all the neighbor kids are threatened with death if they take a dump in your pool.</span></span></span></p>

Okay. So Rick says, &#8220;Thanks for the Q&amp;A episodes. They&#8217;ve been super fun. I&#8217;m writing to ask you a question about running when I&#8217;m on keto. I&#8217;m 45 years old, male, 6 foot tall, 235 pounds and roughly 30% body fat. Trying to lose some weight is the primary goal, but I love running, too. My ideal workout regimen is to lift two times per week, full-body barbell-type stuff, and run three to four times with runs anywhere from 4 to 10 miles. I&#8217;ve never been fast, but I&#8217;ve got pretty decent endurance.&#8221; Let&#8217;s see. &#8220;Keto seems to be the absolute best way to lose weight, but I find that my runs really tank. I use a heart rate meter and go about a minute per mile slower than my heart rate &#8230; is 10 to 20 beats per minute higher.&#8221; That didn&#8217;t really-</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">He goes slower and his heart rate gets higher, yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;The longest I&#8217;ve been able to maintain keto is about five weeks, and the main reason I fall off the wagon is this: while I&#8217;m not weighing and measuring, I&#8217;m more or less following the suggestions from the masterclass and Ketogains, and I&#8217;m focusing on getting enough electrolytes. So what do you think is going on? Do I just have to keep plugging? Is it possible I&#8217;m not meant to run while in keto? How can I speed adaptation? Lots of short slow runs, fast runs, slog it out for long and slow? Any advice you have would be fantastic.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, so reading between the lines here, a couple of different things: are you for sure 100% unequivocally hitting your electrolyte levels? I thought I was and I wasn&#8217;t. And in theory, I&#8217;m an expert on this stuff. But Tyler and Louise, each time I came back to them talking about jujitsu and other issues they were just like, &#8220;Electrolytes, electrolytes,&#8221; and ultimately that ended up being the big deal. So that&#8217;s a glaring thing here. Yeah, it just popped up again and again and again.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So the low-hanging fruit is really making sure that you&#8217;re getting a minimum of five grams of sodium a day plus the other electrolytes. You&#8217;re a bigger dude, so you might even need a little bit more than that. Depending on the heat and humidity of the area that you&#8217;re in you might need even more. That&#8217;s one thing.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other thing is that, in general, keto adaptation takes about four to five weeks. You are slogging through the hardest part, and then stopping at just about the point that all the research suggests that we should get our VO2 max back and we should at least be able to do aerobic-paced activities.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So I would say, yeah, you probably need to &#8230; A couple of different things: if you want to stick with specifically keto, you&#8217;re going to have to motor a bit longer, really make sure that you&#8217;re on point with the electrolytes, and I would give it a full eight weeks to make sure that you&#8217;re fully adapted to that.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The other thought is that you don&#8217;t have to be keto to lose weight. It&#8217;s effective, and it&#8217;s effective in part because of the appetite-suppressing kind of characteristics, but there&#8217;s this whole thing of low-carb and paleo and stuff like that, you know, people motor along quite well with those approaches.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s kind of funny. For ages, I would search for &#8220;Brazilian jujitsu ketogenic diet&#8221;, &#8220;optimal diet on Brazilian jujitsu&#8221;, and what was really funny is the kind of &#8230; the thing that came back &#8230; the vegan diet actually came back fairly frequently, but in general it was, &#8220;Man, this paleo diet is awesome for Brazilian jujitsu.&#8221; But this is paleo as in eating sweet potatoes and fruit and all that, that type of stuff, not like a super low-carb iteration of it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So, yeah, hang in there if you want to. Slog it out for at least eight weeks. Make damn certain that you&#8217;re on point with your electrolytes. Then, from there, if things are just really not clicking over, focus on the appropriate amount of protein, get low glycemic load carbs and titrate those up to the point that you actually get your performance back.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All right.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Or start Brazilian jujitsu, because it&#8217;s awesome.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Okay. Our next question is from Brian, &#8220;Carbs for endurance once fat adapted. Robb, I&#8217;d love your insight. I&#8217;m a 47-year-old cyclist, typically the last guy on Earth touting a low-carb eating regimen, but I&#8217;ve been keto over a year and I&#8217;ve seen performance increase against my age. I presume my body has undergone a metabolic shift in fuel source because it&#8217;s working for me. My question is, should us endurance guys still carb load to have glucose present during long events, or should calorie consumption prior to long events stay parallel to our everyday eating regimen? In other words, once this metabolic shift occurs in the macro perspective of one&#8217;s nutrition, is it assumed that the best fuel choice during ultra events be the same? Would reintroducing glucose be a safety net or a waste of calories in your opinion?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Man. So the first caveat here is I am absolutely not an endurance coach. I watch this stuff from afar. It&#8217;s not in my wheelhouse. So take that with a huge grain of salt, five-gram grain of salt.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;ve seen this work all over the map. In general, the benefit of a low-carb-fueled athlete is that he or she will need less in-event fueling than what somebody else would, a more carb-centric individual.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Marathon doesn&#8217;t really seem to matter that much if you&#8217;re really fast, because the marathon &#8230; those dudes are running so fast, and they get it done in about two hours, which is kind of the outer edge of what one&#8217;s glycogen stores are, so the people who typically hit the wall in marathoning do it because they run slow enough such that they end up depleting their muscle glycogen and they&#8217;re not adequately fat-adapted. So if you&#8217;re real fucking fast and the duration isn&#8217;t that long, then even the glycogen stores from keto adaptation will kind of motor you through that for the most part.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I have absolutely seen folks do the sweet potato or rice the day before an event, and that works well for some people. Peter Defty over at Vespa, OFM, Optimum Fat Metabolism &#8230; he&#8217;s an endurance coach, a legit endurance coach; has a lot of people under his tutelage. They do a couple of different strategies. They will do the day before doing higher carbs so that you get some top off. Other people simply use some goo or some other things, but they&#8217;re able to use it pretty selectively, because they are running more on a fat-adapted kid of plateau or process.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;m trying to think of any other offerings there. Joe Friel is a great coach, Peter Defty, Elijah Markstrom. And I&#8217;m thinking back to the question that we just asked a moment ago. Elijah Markstrom is a really well-known kind of Spartan race athlete. He noticed that being purely ketogenic was problematic. What he experienced was it was almost like he had a governor on his heart rate. Like, he would try to push hard, but his heart rate would be much higher, fully keto-fueled, versus even doing 100, 120 grams of carbs. At a given power output, his heart rate would be, like, 10 to 20 beats less, which is huge; like, make or break a scenario.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So I&#8217;ve seen a lot of different strategies on this stuff and it&#8217;s just all up for the tinkering. Potentially, I would reach out to some of the people that I&#8217;ve mentioned, maybe nose around some of the other low-carb or peri low-carb endurance coaches and maybe have them kind of take you under their wing for some period of time so that you can help get that stuff dialed in.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But my sense is definitely that there&#8217;s not a one-size-fits-all approach to this. It&#8217;s really dependent on, man, a ton of different variables: the duration of the event, how fat-adapted you are; again, shorter events like a sprint, triathlon, and I think they mentioned ultra events-</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A cyclist. I don&#8217;t think &#8230; Yeah, ultra events. Yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ultra events. I mean, real long stuff. People do still use carbohydrate during those events, like Sami Inkinen, who&#8217;s a cofounder of Virta, he did a pretty interesting blog post talking about a really epic bike ride that he did, and he ended up consuming 150, 200 grams of carbs throughout the course of that day, but was also tracking his ketone levels and he was ketogenic the whole time because of the work output.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, man. I wish I had a more concrete answer for you, but this is where working with a coach, or if you&#8217;re going to put this stuff together you kind of just need to establish a baseline and then pressure test it and see how things do. Then, A/B test variables: &#8220;I added pre-workout carbs: these things happened. I added intra workout carbs: these things happened. I added intra workout carbs plus an NCT oil and I pooped my pants.&#8221; That thing happens. So you just kind of have to get in and tinker with it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Again, some of the really well-established endurance coaches may have a much better kind of algorithm that they move through it. But I understand that stuff in theory, not in practice.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All right. Our next question is from Heather on having a high fasting blood glucose level on a low-carb keto diet. &#8220;Hi Robb and Nicki. Huge fan, and appreciate all the knowledge and insight you share on the podcast and everywhere else you show up. I&#8217;ve eaten low-carb paleo-ish for several years now and have done really well. I probably eat less than 100 grams of carbs per day, more like around 50, and eat an average of 100 grams of protein per day: grass-fed meat, bone broth protein, whey protein smoothies, nuts, seeds, pastured eggs, mackerel, sardines, and occasionally chicken.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">My fat intake is probably 90 to 100 grams per day. I&#8217;m 43 years old, 5&#8217;4&#8243; at 118 pounds with less than 20% body fat. I go on long walks daily, weight train three times a week, and throw some hit training along with boxing in the mix. I used to be a spinning instructor and spent hours and hours on the bike each week, but haven&#8217;t taught in four years and now only power walk for cardio outside of interval training at the gym. I have two kids, ages four and eight, so they keep me busy as well.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I recently, as of two weeks ago, bought a blood glucose meter after giving into my curiosity as to just what my fasting blood glucose is, along with postprandial, postexercise, et cetera. I was shocked and so upset when I took my first reading one morning and it was 106. Since then, I&#8217;ve been rather obsessed and am pricking my finger all day long. But really, no matter if I&#8217;m fasted, just went on a long walk or weight training session, or even two hours after a meal, my blood glucose is always somewhere between 90 and 110. I never get a big swing upward after a meal, even after I indulged in gluten-free German chocolate cake the other night. It has only gone as low as 83 or 87 on two random occasions, which is making me wonder, &#8220;What the heck.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I&#8217;ve read different things about this online, but I really don&#8217;t know who to trust other than you. Could it be cortisol? Could that be my norm? I was expecting my fasting blood glucose to be around 70 to 80 based on my diet and activity level.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Please advise. I&#8217;m so confused. Thank you so much for all you do.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So I think last week&#8217;s podcast we kind of had something similar to this where the individual had kind of higher blood glucose levels than what they might think.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The way that we tackle this is what I call triangulating in on this. So we have a blood glucose level that&#8217;s being tested at various points that looks higher than what we potentially would look. So then we look at the A1C and see what that looks like. And I would recommend just getting the fructosamine at the same time. If the A1C is also elevated and fructosamine is also elevated, then that means we have across the board elevated blood glucose levels. If fasting blood glucose or blood glucose in general as checked by a finger stick or even a CGM is high and A1C is high but fructosamine is low, then we&#8217;ve got some other things going on, like red blood cells living longer because of being on low carb and stuff like that.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s assume that it&#8217;s the drizzling shits and blood glucose is higher than what we would like. A couple of things we can look at. One, is making sure that you&#8217;re on point with electrolytes. We know for a fact that inadequate sodium intake and electrolytes in general is an adrenal stress and people getting on point with the electrolytes ends up dropping heart rate, it drops cortisol levels, it tends to drop blood glucose levels. So I would make damn sure that you&#8217;re on point with the electrolytes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If that doesn&#8217;t address things to the degree that you would like, then we start asking the question around, &#8220;Maybe you would do better at that 150 grams of carbs a day. Maybe a little bit more on heavier training days, a little bit less on sedentary days.&#8221; But that&#8217;s kind of the way that I would tackle this.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">First, I would do a little bit of additional testing to figure out, like, &#8220;Really, what do you have going on? Is it concerning? Is your A1C and your fructosamine elevated in such a away that we would be concerned about that? If it is, then the things to really tinker with are making damn sure that you&#8217;re on point with your electrolytes, specifically sodium. If that doesn&#8217;t address things, then I would definitely get in and tinker with just reintroducing more carbs and see how you do with that.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Any other thoughts, wife?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">No, I don&#8217;t think so. Good question, Heather.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s see here. Well, and it also ties into this. But if she&#8217;s consistently getting &#8230; if every day she&#8217;s getting in that range then it&#8217;s probably not glucose measurement reliability, which is the next question.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Which is the next question, yeah.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">From Pedro. &#8220;Dear Robb, my name is Pedro and I&#8217;m Portuguese. I&#8217;ve been following your work through interviews and your online publications and books. I take many notes from your teachings and have been applying them in my own life which I deeply thank you for. However, a few issues have arised, especially concerning the use of glucometers to measure blood glucose for metabolic control. Fortunately, I had no diseases.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I would like to ask you a few questions. For a year now, I&#8217;ve been regularly using the FreeStyle Precision Neo device and the readings are not reliable at all. I&#8217;ve made many experiments, such as trying to prick my fingers five times in a row to observe the results. The readings are always different, sometimes 15 or more points-&#8220;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Milligram per deciliter.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&#8220;Milligram per deciliter. I&#8217;ve done the card test as well, reproducing the same conditions, and the readings also change if I test a few times and in different days. I&#8217;ve tried different devices, too.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I contacted the company to expose this issue and they told me that there is an acceptable variation of 20 points. Being so, it basically means we can&#8217;t rely on this method to inform us how the body is reacting to foods or to check glucose stability, for example, because it&#8217;s always changing within the same conditions.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I wonder if you have noticed the same issue and if you&#8217;ve found a method to overcome this reliability. I&#8217;ve also used a FreeStyle Libre device, which measures continually the glucose, interstitial fluid. I know there&#8217;s a delay between the readings and the actual glucose level and there&#8217;s also less precision than a blood glucometer. However, the same issue of unreliability is happening.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The profile of the Libre does not have any match with the blood glucometer or even any correlation. One might be going up and the other down, and later one changes and the other doesn&#8217;t. Since glucose levels are so important for health and performance, if the best method to check it is not reliable and trustworthy, it makes all the assumptions and decisions about our health not just worthless but somehow dangerous. I wonder if you have any thoughts on this?&#8221; My best wishes, Pedro.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, it&#8217;s a great question, and this is something that was pretty frustrating when we were kind of rolling out the Seven-Day Carb Test, when I became aware that there&#8217;s about a 20% error in the basic testing in most of these glucometers. I forget, there are some that the error rate is claimed to be around more like 5%. I forget which one that that is.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But if you have a 20% error rate, if your true blood glucose reading is 100, we would not really be surprised if it was as low as 80 or as high as 120. This is why in addition to the testing I recommended this whole matrix of, &#8220;How&#8217;s your cognition? How&#8217;s your digestion? What&#8217;s your kind of sense of inflammation?&#8221; So that we could, again, kind of get multiple &#8230; as hard a data as we could, and then shift a little bit into the softer data, you know, just how you&#8217;re feeling and the performance and whatnot.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And I don&#8217;t have a super good answer to this. The error kind of bars in this story are pretty big. This is why I recommend that folks use it as a guide to kind of point them in a particular direction, but we can&#8217;t get overly hung up on this.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I remember when Nicki did this stuff &#8230; What was it? Your blood glucose ended up, like, two points lower after &#8230; so you had a baseline, and then it went to its high, and then it-</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And then it dropped low and [crosstalk 00:22:05]-</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So it started at, like, 75, and then it went to 105, and then it went to 73. And people were like, &#8220;You have phase 3 craft pattern,&#8221; or something like that. And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Fucking horseshit, people.&#8221; Like, the error &#8230; You&#8217;re trying to ascribe a three-point delta between the initial and the final test when there&#8217;s a 20-point error bar encompassing this whole thing, and I&#8217;m not a statistician, but this is where people almost get overeducated to the point of being dangerous, where, like, you can&#8217;t pull back and look at this stuff with a little objectivity.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I think as time goes on these instruments will get better and better. I will do some poking around and &#8230; I remember when we were kind of thick into the Wired to Eat stuff there were one or two brands that were significantly better with regards to error rate, like, it was more an established, like, 5% error. But this is, again, also where doing the occasional A1C and also the fructosamine, you can use that to just kind of triangulate in on that stuff.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Then, also, finally, I&#8217;m just not a fan of people tracking this stuff every day all the time. I know some people do, they&#8217;re just kind of data geeks. But Christopher Kelly over at Nourish Balance Thrive was talking about this stuff, not just with regards to CGMs, but heart rate variability monitors and power output monitors when you&#8217;re riding your bike and stuff like that. Some of it&#8217;s really valuable, and sometimes it&#8217;s kind of the difference in being able to click over performance and really make the next step in what you&#8217;re trying to do. And a lot of it is just a distraction. Like, you&#8217;re spending all this time trying to pair Bluetooth devices to this, that and the other, instead of just kind of doing what you need to do.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">We were talking this morning about the HRV stuff, because we&#8217;re tinkering with some meditation material-</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Right. There was some article that Tyler shared with us that was talking about how some of these devices are &#8230; there&#8217;s enough error rate within them, but then there&#8217;s this placebo effect that happens, a negative placebo effect. So if, for example, if you&#8217;re wearing something and it tells you that you had a really poor night of sleep, maybe you did, maybe you didn&#8217;t. If it wasn&#8217;t measuring you accurately, maybe you had a decent night of sleep but it says you had a poor night of sleep; that people actually &#8230; the rest of their day they internalize that and they really feel like they had a really terrible night of sleep.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">And it kind of cuts both ways. Like, sometimes they actually didn&#8217;t sleep well but the HRV says they&#8217;re on point, and then they rally and they do okay. Then, to Nicki&#8217;s point, there&#8217;s times where it&#8217;s just kind of a weird error or artifact. Like, when we were tinkering with one of the platforms, I would lay down to read and it would say that I &#8230; it would give me a super shitty ready because it said that I had a latent sleep process, which wasn&#8217;t the issue at all.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Right, you were just laying in bed reading.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, I was just laying in bed reading, and I had my [inaudible 00:25:05] on, and we go to bed when everybody else is still, like, fucking eating dinner and stuff like that. So I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Give me a break,&#8221; you know? And I could never get this thing to give me better than, like, a mid-80s, and heading towards 100. And I was like, &#8220;What else am I going to do to make this thing better?&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">So it became kind of annoying at some point and I think maybe wearing a platform like that, and I know we&#8217;re just wandering all over the place now, but a platform like that in my 20s when I would work myself to the bone then maybe that would be helpful.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">But, yeah, this is where the testing stuff, it&#8217;s valuable, but you&#8217;ve got to really have good context with it and, man, it&#8217;s a narrow window of the information that we have. And being aware, which it sounds like Pedro is very aware of the limitations of what this stuff can tell us and keeping that in proper context, for sure.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Show Notes</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><b>1. </b>[<i>1:31</i>]<b> Aced the 7 day challenge like your wife! So why am I doing this???</b></p>
<p class="western">Erica says:</p>
<p class="western">Hello,</p>
<p class="western">I LOVED your book Wired to Eat. I&#8217;m a 31 year old female. 6ft, at my goal of 160ish lb, 20% body fat. Ive never been heavy, don’t have diabetes in my family. I do have a history of disordered eating &#8211; counting/restricting calories and then binge eating until a year ago when I found low carb. I’ve been on thyroid meds for a few months now, possibly because of the calorie restriction. I’ve had high cholesterol all my life and now it’s even higher since starting Keto 2 months ago (total from 274 to 336! HDL ratio went from 3.2 to 4.7!&nbsp; Triglycerides now 106 (non-fasting), havent had my A1C checked for awhile but it was 5.3 long before keto. going to have my LDLp and fructosamine checked soon.)</p>
<p class="western">Low carb/intermittent fasting has reallly helped me maintain my weight while avoiding trigger foods. I went full Keto 2 months ago because the hunger control intrigued me. It’s gotten MUCH more tolerable, but I still get hunger pangs for breakfast and afternoon snacks daily. But for the first time in my life my very hormonal acne cleared up from keto!</p>
<p class="western">Now, I took the test after 2 months keto and aced it! Every day of the challenge my glucose was similar to your wife&#8217;s, even the day I ate a doughnut! So my question is&#8230; why am I doing this whole low carb thing? I guess no pimples and no trigger foods is a good enough reason; but my question is, are bad carbs even that bad in my case? Maybe my insulin response is a different picture, as my weight seems to come back easily with carbs? But it sure makes resisting cravings difficult now that I know my glucose response will be fine if I have that doughnut and I&#8217;ll go back to my usual mild ketosis within a few hours if I can manage not to eat again soon after. Any tips? Has your wife changed how she eats now that she knows her blood glucose will be fine with most anything she eats? Thank you so much for your response!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western"><b>2. </b>[<i>10:10</i>]<b> Beer and blood sugar</b></p>
<p>Thom says:<br />
Robb and Nicki: Thank you both so much for the work you do to educate the Paleo/Keto community. I have been Paleo for nearly 6 years now and Keto for 2, due to a suggestion given me after having a colectomy and still not feeling good. The results I&#8217;ve experienced are nothing short of miraculous. That has led me to become a huge advocate for the lifestyle and to share it with anyone who will listen. I do heating and air conditioning service, which affords me the opportunity to share it with many people.</p>
<p>My question is this: You have mentioned many times that we should do as many N=1 experiments to see what works for us individually. I have been keeping tabs on my blood sugars, blood pressure, O2 and heart rate levels as well as several clinical blood tests (I don&#8217;t visit the doctor very often, since all they want to do is shove drugs in me every time I go in). Over the years I&#8217;ve been able to hone in on the majority of foods or lifestyles that make me feel good and the ones that make me feel not-so-good. That said, I wanted to pose a question to you.</p>
<p>I have done this test over and over and am very shocked by the results. If I have a typical dinner with a salad or veggies of some sort and some meat, then pair that with low carb wine or tequila, lime and soda water (both very low carb drinks), my blood sugars will be somewhere between 130 and 180 two hours later. However, if I have beer (typically dark, because I prefer the porters and stouts) and check my blood sugars two hours later, I&#8217;m usually below 100 and sometimes as low as 80 or 78. I have tested these variables over and over throughout this past year (yes, I like my drink) and I get the same results. However, I HAVE noticed that the lighter beers, such as ales or lighter IPA&#8217;s do not keep my blood sugars quite as low.</p>
<p>Do you know of anything that might explain this phenomenon?</p>
<p>I have many more questions I would like to ask you, but I&#8217;ll leave it at this one for now. Again, thank you both for all you have done and are doing to keep this community going. My son keeps telling me that I should start my own blog and podcast to help spread the word about this lifestyle. When he does I always mention that I have no definable credentials, such as yours, so I&#8217;m not convinced anyone would even listen to it. So, instead I point him, and many others, to your podcast and website, along with Jimmy&#8217;s, Chris&#8217;s and Mark&#8217;s. You&#8217;re all very educational and the cornerstones of this community. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Gregor says:<br />
Hi Robb,<br />
I really appreciate what you are doing and I am a great fan of your podcasts (I read transcripts). Anyway, to the point: after I cut off grains, sugar, legumes and so on, my fasting glucose went high. On average it is 95 mg/dl, mostly between 90 and 100 mg/dl.<br />
You mentioned this subject in your 385th podcast with Shawn Baker (one of my favorites podcasts on your site), but I didn&#8217;t feel it was fully addressed and explained.<br />
I have a graph for about 15 years of measurements here: <span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://paleosmak.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/glukoza-paleo-2018.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://paleosmak.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/glukoza-paleo-2018.png</a></u></span></span> &#8211; around 2010 I turned paleo/lchf.<br />
Recently I have measured my fasting insulin level and it was 4,9 µIU/ml. I have also measured my glucose levels for one typical day and it is very stable, between 90 and 109 &#8211; here is the graph: <span style="color: #000080;"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://paleosmak.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dobowy-profil-glikemii-paleo-smak.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://paleosmak.pl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dobowy-profil-glikemii-paleo-smak.png</a></u></span></span> (the orange vertical lines are meals, I eat only twice a day).<br />
I know I am no diabetic. I have no health issues except 2-3 mild autoimmune diseases (the symptoms come and go).<br />
Is my quite high fasting glucose anything to worry about? I have a friend following quite similar diet and life style and his fasting sugar is around 70-75. Does my 95 mg/dl fasting sugar have negative impact on my health, aging speed and so on? Can I do anything about that?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for talking one more time about that.<br />

<p class="western"><b>4. </b>[<i>20:12</i>]<b> paleo approach to skin care</b></p>
<p>Andrea says:<br />
Robb, do you have any advice about skin care, such as use of any daily moisturizer or other products? I don&#8217;t use daily sunscreen because I tend to have low Vitamin D levels, but I use it if I&#8217;m going to be outside for an extended period of time. I am approaching 40 and only use a bit of jojoba oil as a moisturizer. I wash my face with bar soap (not the antibacterial kind). I&#8217;m not sure if my minimalist approach is the way to go. Maybe your wife has some experience with some products for women? Thanks!</p>

<p><b>5. </b>[<i>25:51</i>] <b>Weight loss and fat tissue toxin-release</b></p>
<p>Jarno says:<br />
Hi Robb,</p>
<p>Greetings from Finland!</p>
<p>I love your work, thank you for everything you do!</p>
<p>I really liked your stance on the carnivore diet as you discussed it with Mikhayla Peterson. Let&#8217;s not become vegan zealots about it. I&#8217;ve been eating 70-80% carnivore for 6 months and feeling mostly great. Mostly because it&#8217;s not all great. Which brings me to my question. What is your sentiment about the toxin-release from fat tissue during weight loss thingy? Is it real? What the science says at the moment? Have you heard of any connections with joint pain / arthritic pain or nausea with weight loss induced toxin release? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts about this!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jarno</p>

Nobody else is really picking up the sustainability torch and running with it probably because everybody else is smarter than Diana Rogers and I think so.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All right. Well let&#8217;s go ahead and get started with our first question form Erica. Let&#8217;s see. She says, &#8220;I aced the seven-day challenge like your wife so why am I doing this? Hello, I loved your book, Wired to Eat. I&#8217;m a 31-year-old female, six foot tall. My goal of 160-ish pounds, 20% body fat. I&#8217;ve never been heavy, don&#8217;t have diabetes in my family. I do have a history of disordered eating, counting, restricting calories, and then binge eating until a year ago when I found low carb. I&#8217;ve been on thyroid meds for a few months now possibly because of the calorie restriction and I&#8217;ve had high cholesterol all my life. Now, it&#8217;s even higher since starting keto two months ago.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It went from a total of 274 to 336. My HDL ratio went from 3.2 to 4.7. Triglycerides are now 106 non-fasting. I haven&#8217;t had my A1C checked for a while, but it was 5.3 long before keto. I&#8217;m going to get my LDLP and fructosamine checked soon. Low carb and intermittent fasting has really helped me maintain my weight while avoiding trigger foods. I went full keto two months ago because the hunger control intrigued me. It&#8217;s gotten much more tolerable, but I still get hunger pangs for breakfast and afternoon snacks daily. But for the first time in my life, my very hormonal acne has cleared up from keto.&#8221; That&#8217;s awesome. &#8220;Now I took the test after two months of keto and aced it.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Every day of the challenge my glucose was similar to your wife&#8217;s, even the day I ate a doughnut. My question is why am I doing this whole low-carb thing? I guess no pimples and no trigger foods is a good enough reason, but my question is are bad carbs even that bad in my case? Maybe my insulin response is a different picture as my weight seems to come back easily with carbs, but it sure makes resisting cravings difficult now that I know my glucose response will be fine if I have a doughnut. I&#8217;ll go back to my usual mild ketosis within a few hours if I can manage not to eat again soon after. Any tips? Has your wife changed how she eats now that she knows her blood glucose will fine with most anything she eats? Thanks so much for your response.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">How old have you navigated this stuff knowing that you have more latitude than I do or many?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Right, because I don&#8217;t feel the effects of a heavy-carb meal. I don&#8217;t feel foggy-headed and vision changes or any of the things that you and some other people get.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">You&#8217;ve mentioned that if we do a Mexican food bender where you do the tacos, and the rice, and the beans, you&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t feel great.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I don&#8217;t feel great. I mean I recovered pretty quickly, but I don&#8217;t feel great. The main reason why I still eat this way is because, gosh, even though my blood glucose level isn&#8217;t rising, there&#8217;s tons of research that shows if you keep your sugar levels low, you age better. You feel better. I&#8217;m 41, and I wanna be able to do the things that I do now. Hopefully, even more things when I&#8217;m 61 or 81. For me, it&#8217;s an aging-well thing. My mom had autoimmune disease. She had rheumatoid arthritis, and hip problems seem to run in my family. I feel like eating well and trying to maintain mobility in my hips, it&#8217;s a big deal for me. I guess you gotta figure out what your reason is but acne. I had acne growing up. All of my uncles and my dad have those kind of pitted scars from acne on their face. That&#8217;s a big deal for me as well. Gosh, I don&#8217;t know.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In Wired to Eat, when I discussed this, we used those seven-day carb set as just kind of a &#8230; Here&#8217;s the deal. The vast majority of people don&#8217;t respond like you guys do. There is the basic thing. Wired to Eat, ironically, was basically a funnel to move people into a ketogenic diet, but we fucked up by not saying the sneaky way to a ketogenic diet or something like that because keto is so hot and everything. As usual, we&#8217;re 10 years ahead of what is actually relevant. Jermaine was trying to talk about metabolic flexibility and provide something other than completely hard, fast-lane lines like, &#8220;Only do this and go to town.&#8221; But the thing is, most people don&#8217;t respond this way, even the people who do respond more the way that both of you apparently do. In general, what&#8217;s her name again?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Erica.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Erica alluded to the fact that she has disproportionately good appetite control doing else. Now, Louis has talked about how he had disordered eating on both the anorexia and bulimia side of things. There&#8217;s just a disproportionate appetite, not that I don&#8217;t wanna split, into spontaneous eating control that occurs on the lower-carb side. Lower carb can mean a lot of different things depending on what person we&#8217;re talking about. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be keto. That can be different from person to person. I think what it tells you is that if you want to kick your heels up once in a while, it&#8217;s probably not gonna be nearly as catastrophic as when this really. I mean, literally, I do something like that and I get blurry vision changes.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I feel horrible sometimes for a couple of days. It&#8217;s not from gluten. It&#8217;s just from these really crazy blood sugar excursions. They get up into the 190s. There are a lot of people out there in the physique, evidence-based nutrition seen that just fucking dismiss this stuff. These guys are, in my opinion, borderline, worthless, heading towards dangerous. There&#8217;s no thought towards the ancestral context of what a safe blood sugar excursion actually looks like. Some work that Stephen Granner did. It suggests that even an oral glucose tolerance test type story in a metabolically healthy individual is half the total blood sugar excursion of what we get in most westernized populations or what we accept as normal. Somebody quoted a number the other day.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s a major health organization. I&#8217;m blanking on the name of it, but it said that fewer than 12% of Americans are metabolically healthy. That&#8217;s using modern standards. If you use the standard of ancestral health, I don&#8217;t think fucking anybody is metabolically healthy at this point. You and maybe Erica and two or three other people like [inaudible 00:08:00] maybe, but that&#8217;s it. There&#8217;s not that many people that they can plow a big plate of tubers. I&#8217;m being a little dramatic. There are people that do do better or fine on these levels, but a lot of people don&#8217;t. The vast majority of people don&#8217;t. Having this tool here is is just an opportunity so that people can do a self check.</span></span></span></p>

They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s just see what happens.&#8221; It&#8217;s like the far side cartoon with the two deer. The one deer has a bull&#8217;s eye and he&#8217;s bummer for birthmark, man. The coach then or the doctor or whoever, they look at the person. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, gee whiz. We talked about your blood sugars. If they go here, then that&#8217;s bad.&#8221; It&#8217;s almost the person leads their way to this person process. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Okay, I either need the different carbs or fewer carbs, or face the consequences.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>

We have a tendency of doing that. Particularly, I&#8217;ve noticed like our first answer is all over the place and super comprehensive. Then, by the last answer, what? Oh, God, just be done with it. I mean, you probably have some more latitude here. It sounds because of the disordered eating and other things. I would just keep an eye on whether or not these kicking-your-heels-up sessions. Do they lead into problems that then it takes you a while to reel it back in? Or is it you&#8217;re out with some friends or some Mexican food. You had some beans, rice, and churro. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;Damn, that was great.&#8221; Then you&#8217;re just back on point the next day.</span></span></span></p>

Our next question is from Tom on beer and blood sugar. &#8220;Robb and Nicki, thank you both so much for the work you do to educate the Paleo keto community. I&#8217;ve been paleo for nearly six years now and keto for two due to a suggestion given me after having a colectomy and still not feeling good. The results I&#8217;ve experienced are nothing short of miraculous. This has led me to become a huge advocate for the lifestyle, and to share it with anyone who will listen. I do heating and air conditioning service, which affords me the opportunity to share to many people. My question is this, you mentioned many times that we should do as many an equal one experiments to see what works for us individually. I have been keeping tabs on my blood sugar&#8217;s blood pressure, oxygen and heart rate levels, as well as several clinical blood tests.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I don&#8217;t visit the doctor very often since all they wanna do is shrug drugs in me every time I go in. Over the years, I&#8217;ve been able to hone in on the majority of foods or lifestyles that made me feel good and the ones that make me feel not so good. That said, I want to pose a question to you. I&#8217;ve done this test over and over, and I&#8217;m very shocked by the results. If I have a typical dinner with a salad or veggies, some meat then pair that with low-carb Weiner tequila lemon soda water, both very low carb drinks, my blood sugar&#8217;s will be somewhere between 130 and 180 two hours later. However, if I have beer, typically dark, because I prefer the porters and the scouts. Check my blood sugars two hours later and usually below 100.</span></span></span></p>

I have tested these variables over and over throughout this past year. Yes, I like my drink, and I get the same results. However, I have noticed that the lighter beer such as ales or lighter APAs do not keep my blood sugar&#8217;s quite as low. Do you know of anything that might explain this phenomenon? I have many more questions I would like to ask you, but I&#8217;ll leave it at this one for now. Again, thank you both for all you&#8217;ve done and are doing to keep this community going. My son keeps telling me that I should start my own blog and podcast to help spread the word about this lifestyle. When he does, I always mentioned that I have no definable credentials such as yours. I&#8217;m not convinced anyone would even listen to it. Instead, I point him and many others to your podcast and website along with Chris&#8217; and Mark&#8217;s. You&#8217;re all very educational in the cornerstones of this community. Keep up the good work.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>

It mainly keeps the people like myself who were supposed to be experts actually on point with what we&#8217;re talking about. This is really interesting. I don&#8217;t know if Squatchy puts together these batches of questions. Then I read through them, and we tried to get some show notes were appropriate. I know there was some questions around blood sugar levels and alcohol. I don&#8217;t know if we did it already.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s going coming up, but there&#8217;s this wacky phenomena were alcoholics tend to have very low blood sugar levels and very low A1C levels, because the alcohol tends to suppress blood sugar production. It&#8217;s oxidative prioritization stuff so it&#8217;s interesting, but I don&#8217;t know why we would see that. In this case, my only thought is that there may be some an antioxidant effect going on with the beer that maybe it&#8217;s mitigating a stress or inflammatory response, whereas with most people, they might get a stress or inflammatory response. In this case, maybe not. I mean, the fact that we&#8217;re going, if I had initially seen this and somebody just said, &#8220;Hey, when I eat XY meal with alcohol versus without alcohol. With alcohol, the blood sugars are lower, assuming that we&#8217;re doing sugary Margarita drinks or something like that. But those the alcohol meal is lower.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>

We&#8217;re comparing alcohol to alcohol. I&#8217;m guessing on this one that there may be an antioxidant effect with the beer. They do have antioxidants in there. It could be in the darker beer [crosstalk 00:14:24].</span></span></span></p>

I really appreciate what you&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;m a great fan of your podcast. I read the transcripts. Anyway, to the point. After I cut off grains, sugars, sugar, legumes, and so on, my fasting glucose went high. On average, it is 95 milligrams per deciliter, mostly between 90 and 100. You mentioned this subject in your 385th podcast with Shaun Baker, one of my favorite podcasts on your site. But I didn&#8217;t feel it was fully addressed and explained. I have a graph for about 15 years with measurements here. Around 2010, I turned paleo low carb high fat. Recently, I&#8217;ve measured my fasting insulin level, and it was 4.9.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I have also measured my glucose levels for one typical day. It was very stable between 90 and 109. Here&#8217;s the graph of that. The orange vertical lines are meals. I eat only twice a day. I know I&#8217;m no diabetic. I have no health issues except two to three mild autoimmune diseases, the symptoms come and go. Is my quite high fasting glucose anything to worry about? I have a friend following quite similar diet and lifestyle. His fasting sugar is around 70 to 75. Does my 95 milligrams per deciliter fasting sugar have negative impact on my health, aging speed and so on? If so, can I do anything about that? Thanks for taking your time.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, couple of things on this. The dawn phenomenon tends to be where people see this significantly. In the morning, we get a little bit of a cortisol release, helps us get going. That will definitely elevate blood sugars, and perhaps disproportionately in some people. This is where triangulating in on this is helpful. We&#8217;ve got some fasting blood glucose levels, which is okay but it&#8217;s very snapshot. Now we wanna start thinking about, &#8220;Okay, what is this thing look over time.&#8221; It sounds like Gregor tracks this over a day, but still we wanna know weeks, and months, and stuff that. That&#8217;s where A1C, fructosamine can help us triangulate in on this. If fasting blood glucose seems to be consistently high but A1C is normal, then we&#8217;re okay. Not a big deal. We&#8217;re not getting complete excursions that are problematic. They&#8217;re not high old time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If we have fasting, elevated glucose, high A1C then we start getting concerned. This is still where we need to fall back on the fructosamine because the fact that you&#8217;re reading low carb means that red blood cells can live longer, and we can get an artificially elevated red blood cell number from the A1C. If we have a scenario of high-fasting blood glucose, elevated A1C but a low normal fructosamine, then what that tells us is we&#8217;re getting some dawn phenomenon. The A1C is a consequence of red blood cells live in longer. The A1C, to some degree a little bit the linchpin thing that we&#8217;re gonna look in that scenario. Beyond that, some people notice, again, supplementation with electrolytes, particularly sodium can help this.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If we&#8217;re running a little bit sodium deficient, we tend to to have an elevated blood glucose response. There&#8217;s all kinds of mechanistic reasons for that. Some people just find that really interesting reintroducing 7500 grams of carbs, ends up on average dropping their total blood glucose over time. Because, again, this is something that gets lost repeatedly in the low carb scene. It&#8217;s funny. People will freak out about the dangers of too much protein kicking you out of ketosis, but then if they see some elevated blood glucose levels, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m eating no carbs. How can my blood glucose go up?&#8221; If you are a adrenalized, if your sleep is poor, elevated cortisol, then you can have elevated blood glucose levels just from dumping stuff out of the liver.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A couple of things to do, I would get the A1C and fructosamine and see what those look like. If both of the A1C and the fructosamine look good, as we described here, then I wouldn&#8217;t really worry about it. Clearly, you&#8217;re tracking to the pants off this thing. Just keep tracking it and make sure it doesn&#8217;t go anywhere squarely from there. Beyond that, if you want to try to nudge things, I would definitely make sure that you are 100% on point with your sodium intake. Marty Kendall just did a great piece on this for Optimizing Nutrition. Maybe I&#8217;ll try to remember to get that in the show notes. It literally just came up this morning. Then drink LMNT. Our website talks about that a ton. Then finally, reintroducing some carbs. Those are the things to pressure test this, and see which one is working best.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Cool. All right. Let&#8217;s see. Our next question is from Andrea on a paleo approach to skincare. &#8220;Robb, do you have any advice about skincare such as use of any daily moisturizer or other products? I don&#8217;t use daily sunscreen because I tend to have low vitamin D levels, but I use it if I&#8217;m going to be outside for an extended period of time. I&#8217;m approaching 40, and only use a bit of jojoba oil. I can never know how to pronounce, jojoba or jojoba oil as a moisturizer. I wash my face with bar soap, not the antibacterial kind. I&#8217;m not sure if my minimalist approach is the way to go. Maybe your wife has some experiences with products for women. Thanks.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>

What&#8217;s your fave.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gosh, I&#8217;m super minimalist with my skincare routine. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s lots of opinions on this, but just what&#8217;s ended up working for me. When I was a kid and going teenager, I used all kinds of acne soaps and products and whatnot but I&#8217;ve default it now to just basically water. I literally wash my face with water. I don&#8217;t use any soap, and then moisturizer. There&#8217;s two brands that I absolutely love. One is Annmarie skincare. They have a whole suite of products. The one that I love, love, Love is our dear friend, Jessika Le Corre. She has a company called Feather, Eagle and Sky. Her beauty face oil, it&#8217;s amazing. It smells so good. It&#8217;s just all natural. It&#8217;s rosehip oil, I think argan oil. Maybe some sweet almond oil, stuff like that. It&#8217;s smells great, it feels good. It&#8217;s one of those things where you put it on in the morning and you inhale and it just sets your day right.</span></span></span></p>

I tried. I tried, but I just failed there. Anyway, I hope that helps. I&#8217;m 41. It&#8217;s for the last, gosh, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve used. I&#8217;ve just been using water and some face oil as a moisturizer for years.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">I would just add to that. I think that the bulk of skincare comes from internal processes. Circling back around to the first question we had today about blood sugar excursions and whatnot. If you are experiencing elevated blood glucose levels on a consistent basis, by elevated I mean above ancestral levels, which is way more restrictive than what we&#8217;re generally accepting as normal within our westernized populations, you are going to age faster than what you otherwise would. Talking about wrinkles and liver spots and all that type of stuff, they&#8217;re basically advanced glycation end product results, Some of it is sun exposure. A ton of it, though, is glucose-caramelizing proteins effectively and lack of antioxidants, lack of fasting, lack of autophagy, beating up on autophagy, but this is one of the reasons for not eating every day all the time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Making sure you get your sleep so that you stimulate that whole restoration process, but I just about got fired out of whole foods. I was working part-time at Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center, part-time running the herb binding section of the nutrition deal at the Roosevelt store in Seattle. People would come in, and they would ask for all the skincare type stuff. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Listen,&#8221; so I would hook them up with a protein power life plan book. Welcome over the meat section, have them buy all the stuff. Get a little bit of alpha lipoic acid and a couple of other antioxidants. It was maybe 80-90% of them were mom with a daughter who had acne. Both of them were concerned about this stuff. The mom&#8217;s issue&#8217;s different than the daughter&#8217;s issues. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Trust me. Do this for one week. Come back.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">They were like, &#8220;Oh my god,&#8221; so they were eating olive oil and eating low carb and all this stuff. Then the the face care person was getting absolutely livid because I wasn&#8217;t selling any of that shit. I think that there&#8217;s good stuff, but it&#8217;s just disproportionate how much impact that diet and sleep, and all that stuff has on the story versus putting something. Think about it. The skin is designed to be largely impermeable to the outside world. Not 100%, but the things that do soak through the skin are lipid-based. It can be a route to getting toxicants into your skin. Tiolene and gasoline and stuff will go through the skin because it&#8217;s lipid-soluble. You have a very modest effect with something on the surface like coconut oil. Our girls get dry skin. We&#8217;ll put coconut oil on them. It will help sealing the juices and all that stuff. But still, I think for the most part, tackling diet is really the way to do this.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Nicki:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">From Finland. &#8220;Greetings from Finland. I love your work. Thank you for everything you do. I really like your stance on the carnivore diet as you discussed it with Mikhaila Peterson. Let&#8217;s not become vegan zealots about it. I&#8217;ve been eating 70 to 80% carnivore for six months and feeling mostly great. Mostly because it&#8217;s not all great, which brings me to my question. What is your sentiment about the toxin release from fat tissue during weight loss? Is it real? What is the science say at the moment? Have you heard any connections with joint pain and arthritic pain or nausea with weight loss-induced toxin release? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts.&#8221;</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s one of those things that, again, if you were to pass this one by the evidence-based nutrition scene, for the most part, I think that people would scoff at it. But as we just talked about briefly in previous question, a lipid-based toxins go through the skin more effectively. They store preferentially in the fat tissue. If somebody is offloading a signal good amount of fat, there can be a toxic effects. Some of that can even be the skewed omega three, omega six balance really gets exasperated during that time. Yeah, this is a real thing. There&#8217;s not a ton of research on it. There is some research where they actually look at some of the the metabolite endpoints for different common environmental toxicants that are known to accumulate in the fat, and looking at urine, fecal, and I think, to some degree, breath release.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s elevated in people that are losing significant amounts of fat. It&#8217;s not accepted science, but the theory makes a lot of sense. I would say that we have enough anecdote there that it&#8217;s probably yes. This is a thing. What do you do about it is a good question. Some liver support like alpha lipoic acid, Jarrow Formulas has a slick liver support formula that has milk thistle, alpha lipoic acid, selenium, and a couple other co-factors that are involved with multiple angles in the liver detox pathway. Getting some fiber. This is one of the valuable spots for fiber if a process like this is going on, because bile salts do associate with fiber.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="left"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><u>Robb:</u></span></span></span> <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">If those are pulled out of the feces and not reabsorbed, then the fat-soluble toxicants that may be in the bile salts actually exit the body instead of getting reabsorbed. There&#8217;s maybe some arguments there. Then, some of this is just you gotta ride it out until you reach that weight loss goal. Then, that should, in theory, be less of an issue.</span></span></span></p>
