      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boba Fett is one of the most popular characters in the Star Wars universe, and his helmet is perhaps the most iconic after Darth Vader's. Unlike Vader, however, we never see him without his helmet, at least in the original trilogy, which makes it the only "face" we have representing the character.
</p><p>Some people like to act like Boba Fett isn't awesome just because his death in the Sarlacc pit was underwhelming. If you're one of those people, this helmet isn't for you. However, if you love and appreciate the bad-assedeness Fett exudes, this amazing replica Mandalorian bounty-hunter helmet from Hasbro's Star Wars Black Series is something you should consider picking up.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a new blog post ArtPlay and 505 Games offered an update for when Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night for the Nintendo Switch may finally receive the performance improvements that were promised after the game was released.
</p><p><h2>What’s Wrong With Bloodstained on Switch?</h2>
</p><p>When Bloodstained was released, players on the Nintendo Switch were disappointed to find that the Switch version seemed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/2019/06/28/bloodstaineds-switch-port-examining-the-problems" target="_blank">suffer issues</a> not present on other consoles. This included some <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/2019/06/26/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-pc-vs-switch-side-by-side-comparison" target="_blank">serious frame rate and optimization problems</a> that sometimes made Bloodstained run at 15 FPS, even when the game is capped at 30 FPS on the Switch.
