<p>If there is one part of our home that we use the most, it&#8217;s our <strong>kitchen dining area</strong>. It&#8217;s right next to the open kitchen (where Julia is always cooking something that smells great) and it&#8217;s without a doubt the sunniest spot in our house— with a view of the whole backyard. Sitting there reminds us why we decided to move to the country and why were are so lucky and grateful to have this special place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-30.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-312755" src="https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-30.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-30.jpg 1000w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-30-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-30-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-30-668x445.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>Aside from putting in a banquette, we haven&#8217;t done much to the space over the past five years. The pets have made the banquette <em>their</em> space, so it was in desperate need of an update and reupholstery. But more than that, our chairs had to go. We got our table and chairs from the home&#8217;s previous owner for a small price, and we have made the <em>most</em> out of them. But they&#8217;ve been the creakiest, squeakiest chairs ever. Despite reinforcing them multiple times on our own (thanks, DIY Youtubers!), we knew that it was time to say goodbye and upgrade to some safer and more stable chairs.</p>
<p>So with seating in mind, we decided to change out both the banquette cushion fabric and the chairs around the table. For the bench cushions I decided to invest in some fabric I&#8217;ve been eyeing for a long time — <a href="https://jennypennywood.com/"><strong>Jenny Pennywood</strong></a>&#8216;s <a href="https://jennypennywood.com/collections/fabric-by-the-yard/products/copy-of-triangles-in-flax-fabric-by-the-yard">Triangles Fabric in Indigo</a>. Our kitchen is mainly blue and white colors, so that deep indigo hue (which I know will eventually fade in the sunlight to a lovely, soft denim blue) goes with everything so nicely. Jen Garrido (aka, Jenny Pennywood) is such a talented artist and someone that I&#8217;ve followed since the beginning of Design*Sponge. <a href="http://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/dsc07196.jpg">This deer painting of hers</a> was one of the first &#8220;grown-up&#8221; purchases I made, and to invest in her fabric work all these years later feels so meaningful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-44.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-312756" src="https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-44.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-44.jpg 1000w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-44-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-44-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-44-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.designsponge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DSDingFabricChair-44-668x446.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>With our bench cushions in progress (thanks to our favorite upholsterer in town, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dartice826/?hl=en">Darlene Tice</a>), it was time to look at chairs. Julia and I knew we wanted something light and airy, so we decided to hunt for something made of rattan or cane, so it would have a beachy feel. After weeks of looking (you can see some of the others we considered <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/designsponge/graces-house-updates/">here</a>), we decided that these gorgeous <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com/balboa-side-chair/m12347.html#start=19"><strong>Balboa chairs</strong></a> from <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com">Serena &amp; Lily</a> were the ones. They have the breezy beachy vibes we wanted, but feel sturdy and sophisticated enough to last for years to come. <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com">Serena &amp; Lily</a> kindly gifted us three of the <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com/balboa-side-chair/m12347.html#start=19">side chairs</a> and the <a href="https://www.serenaandlily.com/balboa-armchair/m12348.html">armchair version</a> for the head of the table, so with those in place, we were ready to dress up the space and settle in for a summer meal.</p>
<p>The end result is a fresh look for our favorite room in the house. I love how sunny this space feels and it&#8217;s been the perfect home for not just friends and many special meals, but it&#8217;s also the room where our late friend Georgine&#8217;s cactus lives. If you followed our friendship with her through our volunteer shift (or watched my <a href="https://www.designsponge.com/2019/07/grace-at-creative-mornings-people-matter-real-life-matters.html">Creative Mornings talk</a> about our friendship), you&#8217;ll know how much this plant means to us. So sitting here with coffee every morning in our new chairs and thinking about our time with her (and learning to tend cacti thanks to her expertise) is the best feeling ever. <em>xo, Grace</em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Blogger <a href="https://grillo-designs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medina Grillo</a>, author of the upcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Home-Sweet-Rented-Medina-Grillo/dp/1784726001" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Home Sweet Rented Home</em></a>, is no stranger to getting her hands dirty. In fact, she&#8217;s been showing her readers various ways to make affordable, DIY changes to their rentals since 2015. More recently, though, Medina&#8217;</span><span class="s1">s taken all she&#8217;s learned and applied it to the entryway in her <em>own</em> apartment.</span></p>
<p>Since the space is the first thing visitors see when they enter the rental, Medina wanted to put a unique twist on it. To get started, she tackled the accompanying staircase that rises mere feet from her front door. An accent that once held a forgettable runner, all 13 steps are now bold and black and host a DIY stenciling technique that has them each numbered. &#8220;E<span class="s1">very time I climb the stairs I find myself counting to myself,&#8221; Medina says.</span></p>
<p>The staircase shares the spotlight with a large wall that previously stood undecorated. It was large, white, and noticeably barren. Post renovation, however, it stands out thanks to the addition of a trendy topographic wallpaper (removable, of course) and a floating IKEA cabinet. The latter proved finicky to install and make level, but after a few attempts it finally settled into place. From there, Medina went about accessorizing and decorating the nook in order to make the space flow into the aforementioned staircase, her living room and beyond. It&#8217;s quite the transformation, so scroll down to see more. E<span class="s1">njoy! </span><em>—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/insta__gare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garrett</a></em></p>

<p><em>Image above: The entryway&#8217;s initial design called for the entire wall to be wallpapered, but when Medina priced out the design it was too costly. She&#8217;s instead created a chair rail out of wallpaper, saving herself hundreds of dollars.</em></p>

<p>When it comes to anything related to the culinary arts, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/FOODCULTURIST/">Nicole Taylor</a> is unquestionably your go-to expert. She has worked as a freelance food writer for over 10 years, covering everything from restaurant openings in Brooklyn to what do with maple sugar. In between freelance jobs for numerous publications, she has written two cookbooks that celebrate Southern cooking. She also lends her time to organizations focused on equity for people of color and LGBTQ food folks. Nicole was recently appointed executive food editor at <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/">Thrillist</a>, a website covering all the good things in food, drink, travel, and entertainment.</p>
<p>Nicole&#8217;s husband, <a href="https://adrianfranks.com/">Adrian Franks,</a> is an artist and creative director at a tech company. Eight months ago, just before the birth of their son Garvey Crown Franks, the couple moved to their current rental apartment in Brooklyn&#8217;s Flatbush neighborhood. Their two-floor apartment in a recently completed building complex offers breathtaking views over both Brooklyn and Manhattan. &#8220;Some of the best memories are on the terrace hosting people during the holidays. People soak in the views,&#8221; Nicole explains. In addition to the priceless cityscape, the family&#8217;s home is also located just a stone&#8217;s throw from Prospect Park and Brooklyn Botanic Garden, some of the area&#8217;s best outdoor spaces. Nicole also loves her neighborhood&#8217;s diversity and Caribbean diaspora: &#8220;Some businesses have been around forever and a day, food businesses in particular. I walk down Nostrand Avenue and go to Allan&#8217;s Bakery for guava pastries and Daleview Biscuits and Beer for wine,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>When it came to decorating her family&#8217;s home, Nicole swiftly learned to make quick decisions and to say yes to help. A slew of friends helped the couple to unpack their collection over 600 art books, while <a href="http://njainteriors.com">Naika Andre</a>, a designer from Homepolish, provided tips on how to turn Garvey&#8217;s nursery into an inviting space. The room now features glamorous removable wallpaper and midnight blue hues that contrast the rough concrete walls, a main characteristic of the apartment. The large windows and unobstructed views from each room in the apartment always make Nicole feel light and free when she comes home after a long day. She explains, &#8220;My home still keeps me dreaming. It keeps me grateful. It keeps me humble about what a privilege it is living in the city.&#8221; —<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sofia.tuovinen/"><em>Sofia</em></a></p>

<p><em>Image above: When Nicole and Adrian began looking for a new home for their growing family, there were a few must-haves on their checklist. &#8220;We were looking for a rental that had all the modern conveniences. We needed a lot of light and a space to hold over 600 art books and cookbooks. A place that still had a touch of old Brooklyn was a must,&#8221; Nicole tells us. </em></p>

For the past 10 years, she and her partner Paul have lived in a Victorian villa in Hove, East Sussex in the UK. Although the couple still has ongoing house projects, they have transformed their home drastically over the last decade, highlighting period details while adding personal touches to each space. When Poonam and Paul&#8217;s son Zachary was born five years ago, Poonam left the corporate world of HR to focus on family. About a year ago, she wanted to try something new and started her blog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/modernluxeblog/">Modern Luxe</a>, where she shares her home&#8217;s renovation along with completed makeovers.</p>
<p>When Poonam and Paul first moved in, they started off with painting their house in neutral colors. They wanted to live in and experience each space before deciding on colors and moods. &#8220;We talked about dark colors and as we’ve got really high ceilings we can get away [with] it, without losing the sense of space. &#8220;Initially Paul wasn’t convinced, so whilst he was away on a business trip, I painted the living room in Farrow &amp; Ball &#8216;Railings.&#8217; [Paul] didn’t speak to me for a couple of hours when he got back, but he loves it now and was more than happy for us to go dark in the bedroom too!&#8221; Poonam shares. Today, the family&#8217;s home includes various hues that continue beautifully from one space to the next, making the rooms feel both unique and connected at the same time. &#8220;Each of the rooms flows into each other, bringing a sense of unity, which we love,&#8221; Poonam explains.</p>
<p>Although Poonam and Paul now feel like they have a house they can proudly call home, they are still working on changes that will ultimately allow them to spend more quality time together as a family. Poonam has plans to change some things here and there, starting with the living room. She explains, &#8220;When we first bought the house, we didn&#8217;t have Zachary. But now [the house] needs to function as a family space. And I think on the whole it does, but there are a few rooms like the living room that look great but just don&#8217;t feel quite right as a family space. So that&#8217;s the next room on my hit list.&#8221; Scroll down to see how Poonam and Paul have created a home they love. For updates to the living room and the rest of the family&#8217;s home, there&#8217;s Poonam&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/modernluxeblog/">Instagram</a>. —<a href="https://instagram.com/sofia.tuovinen"><em>Sofia</em></a></p>

<p><em>Image above: Adding shutters was one of the first things that Poonam did when she and Paul moved in. &#8220;Whilst they enhance all the original features, it also gives our house a modern feel, which is one of the reasons we love them,&#8221; Poonam says. </em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oftentimes entrepreneur <a href="http://www.laurawellington.co.uk/"><span class="s2">Laura Wellington</span></a> is kept busy by the varying commercial and residential design assignments she receives from her clients. Recently, however, she found the time to oversee a much more personal project: the revamp of her own home in Leeds, England. Using a rather unique working style, she and her partner James have infused their home with a collection of colors and accessories the likes of which we rarely come across.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The house’s color palette is a great example of the organic process Laura used to achieve the look. When it came time to paint, she was excited by the prospect of potentially using some of the colors she’d recommended to her clients but that hadn’t made the cut. Samples in hand, Laura headed to the kitchen and a wall that was destined for demolition. “I stood back and created a color journey,” she beings. “I let my eyes take me to the next color leading from the living room right up to the attic.” She even designed one of the hues herself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Form there, Laura “dumped” all of her existing furniture into the appropriate room and let her imagination help shape the space. This freeform and “playful” workflow saw her pairing wild accessories together and coming up with clever DIY hacks. In one space she made use of leftover materials from client projects. In another, she turned a dining table into shelves to display some of her favorite accessories.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While she’s thrilled with the way her renovation turned out, Laura says the most profound takeaway from the process is her renewed confidence in herself, her abilities and her eye for design. Because of this, she’s even been making bolder choices at both the hair salon and when she gets dressed every morning. Scroll down to see the home that has Laura holding her head higher than ever. Enjoy!</span><span class="s1"> </span><em>—<a href="https://www.instagram.com/insta__gare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garrett</a></em></p>

<p><em>Image above: Laura collected all of the paints her color-averse clients have rejected over the years and put them all in her own home. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things I did was to get all those colors up on a wall which was being knocked down in the kitchen, and then I stood back and created a color journey. I let my eyes take me to the next color leading from the living room right up to the attic,&#8221; she explains.</span></em></p>

We&#8217;ve previously featured her transformed <a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2015/12/before-after-a-seattle-rental-gets-a-bathroom-makeover.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bathroom</a> when she was a renter, and today we&#8217;re sharing her new kitchen makeover with you in the home she now owns.</p>
<p>One might think: the smaller the room, the easier the project &#8212; right? For this kitchen remodel, however, that&#8217;s far from true. For 10 months, Joanna and her fiancé Sean lived in their very small bungalow, cooking outside under a tarp, on a camping stove &#8212; even throughout the rainy Seattle winter. &#8220;Our bungalow is over 110 years old, so we had a lot of old house quirkiness to contend with,&#8221; Joanna recalls. &#8220;For example, all of our floors and walls are actually made of 3-4 layers of shiplap&#8230; but not the pretty, Joanna Gaines kind. The cedar pieces are randomly cut and mismatched together because the house was probably built by shingle mill workers. Oh, also, our floors were very uneven and lumpy because the house was built on logs (they still have their bark on them!). We did a lot of foundation work in order to level the floor and have somewhat square walls. Now it&#8217;s the only room in the house that isn&#8217;t super-crooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowing that this project might be a bit out of her comfort zone based on the amount of attention that it needed, Joanna reached out to Sarah from <a href="https://roomfortuesday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Room For Tuesday</a> for help. &#8220;Redoing a bedroom is one thing, but a kitchen is a major investment, so I wanted to get it <em>right,</em>&#8221; Joanna begins. &#8220;Sarah is an incredibly talented designer and renovates homes all on her own, so I knew that she&#8217;d get it right. Sarah lives in Salt Lake City, so we were in constant contact via text, FaceTime, and email. She was a rockstar on this project and helped us troubleshoot so many mishaps.&#8221; Together, they were able to swap the kitchen&#8217;s particle board two-tone cabinets for <a href="https://www.diamondcabinets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom cabinets</a> in a sleek and modern take on a tuxedo kitchen, and add new <a href="https://www.kitchenaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appliances</a> in a seamless line (rather than the original misshaped layout) and <a href="https://www.polycor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marble countertops</a>.</p>
<p>Joanna leaves us with this sweet story about her home, &#8220;My favorite story to tell about our tiny bungalow is how I actually came to own it! In 2015, my grandfather Harvey passed away and the loss was devastating to me. The last conversation we had consisted of me telling him that I was finally moving back to Seattle after a few years of feeling so lost and ungrounded. He was incredibly happy to hear that, knowing that the PNW was my real home and where I felt the happiest. A year after he passed, I found out that he had left a large sum of money for me to purchase my first home and to &#8216;settle down,&#8217; in his words. Within four weeks of receiving the sum, I had looked at over 30 houses and fell in love with this tiny, weird little bungalow. Several contractors tried to buy it in order to tear it down and build townhouses on the lot, but they all fell through&#8230; so I swooped in with my offer and the seller accepted it! Every renovation I do in the house is meant to honor my grandfather and his memory. If you notice the floor tiles, they are <a href="https://www.fireclaytile.com/tile/colors/detail/slate-blue/tile-specialty-field-chaine-homme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H-shaped</a> as a subtle homage to him. It felt like the best way to thank him and honor him in this new space.&#8221; &#8212;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/erinaustenabbott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Erin</em></a></p>
