Their newest product is called Smoke and is specifically designed to help people barbecue and smoke food at home. Smoke has two parts - a base unit (which takes two of Thermoworks standardized Pro-Series probes) and a wireless receiver unit - which lets the user track the air temperature and the food temperature without going outside to the smoker.<br /><img src='/pics6/smoke/Smoke_generic-01_320.jpg' title=''  /><br /><br />Thermoworks is selling the <a href="http://www.thermoworks.com/Smoke?tw=COOKINGFORENGINEERS">Smoke</a> at $99 and this would definitely welcome tool for anyone who likes to slow cook food outside.<br /><br /></div></summary>

There are lots of reasons for this including lack of time (or perhaps poor time management) and raising Emma (who is now nearly 3 years old), but I haven't stopped cooking and trying stuff in the kitchen. Many readers have encouraged me to return to writing and not worry so much about preparing an exhaustive article. A few have also suggested that to get back into writing, I could just write about stuff that I use or cook regularly. With that in mind, I've decided to start writing shorter equipment reviews to get back into the rhythm of writing. Then I was faced with the daunting task of picking what to write about first. After some more paralysis, I decided to write about a tool that I don't use that much anymore, but I'm happy to have on hand when I need it: OXO Good Grips Food Mill.<br /><br /><br /><img src='/pics6/oxofoodmill/main_320.jpg' title=''  /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></summary>

It was created by the early Dutch settlers who quickly realized that meat would not stay fresh for long in that hot climate and that you would need to make provisions for your journey as there was no guarantee that you would find meat along the way. When Voortrekkers where moving though the wilderness of South Africa, they changed the indigenous curing process from one that used salt as the key curing ingredient to that of vinegar.<br /><br /><i>Originally from Zimbabwe, Sebastian now lives in the UK where he spends some of his spare time in the kitchen cooking and experimenting with food and the gadgets that you find in the kitchen.

As a relatively new parent, I'm keenly aware now of just how fragmented and saturated the toy market is. There are several toys for nearly every niche one can imagine with quality varying from high to low, pricing from super-cheap to "those aren't toy prices", and playability from mere seconds of interest to a lifetime of attachment. As a firm believer in early learning through play, I find that most toys are educational in some respect (although some toys need a stretch of the imagination to determine how they aid in development). Rarely, have I encountered a toy like Jerry the Bear who is both cute and lovable and teaches children with health issues through role playing and caretaking.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div></summary>

No count down timers, no count up timers, no alarm start or stop... just set the target temperature and you're done. Sometimes simple is just what is needed.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div></summary>

Essentially, they authors had taken what was known about cooking and compiled it in one six-volume set comprised of ease-to-read text, wonderful design, and beautiful photography. Unfortunately, initially there were a limited number of copies in print and the $500-$625 price tag for the set placed it a bit out of reach of the general public. In 2012, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0982761015?tag=cfe-20">Modernist Cuisine at Home</a> debuted at $140. This book was a single 450 page volume (plus a spiral-bound kitchen manual) which distilled the exhaustive information found in Modernist Cuisine's 2400 pages into a resource home chefs could easily take advantage of. As of late 2013, <a href="https://www.inkling.com/read/modernist-cuisine-at-home-myrhvold-bilet-1st/a-modernist-meal-at-home/intro">Modernist Cuisine at Home</a> is now available digitally through <a href="https://www.inkling.com/">Inkling</a> and it is every bit as amazing as the previous incarnations at a much more accessible price point - $4.99 per chapter or $79.99 for the whole book.<br /><br /></div></summary>

My husband and I were so lucky that we scored reservations during the few days in May that we were in Barcelona, but I think that was partly due to the fact that the restaurant only opened in April so the buzz hadn't gotten out of control yet. When we went for dinner (at 7:30, which is an absurdly early time for most Spaniards), our waitress Sussie told us that the restaurant was in its seventh week. Therefore, we got to be some lucky guinea pigs for some of the menu items that Adri&amp;agrave; wanted to try out.<br /><br /></div></summary>

My Emma is too young (she's only two months old) to play this game, but I plan on sharing it with her in a couple years.

    <summary type="xhtml" xml:base="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/" xml:space="preserve"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the founders of <a href="http://www.codlo.com/">Codlo</a> contacted me last week to tell me about the water bath temperature controller that they've designed and are planning to build with the assistance of Kickstarter (the online crowd funding website). I've used a variety of <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/289/Sous-Vide-Cooking-at-Home-Setup-Guide">methods to control temperature in a water bath for sous vide cooking</a> and one of my favorites is simple: plug in a PID controller equipped with a thermocouple to the wall and plug in a device like a rice cooker filled with water into the controller. Submerging a thermocouple connected to the PID controller in the water bath provides feedback so the controller can toggle the power to the heating device on and off to accurately control the temperature of the bath. Codlo is such a controller, but designed to be aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and intuitive. The Kickstarter campaign begins at 9am PDT on Friday, June 28, 2013 and can be reached at <a href="http://get.codlo.com/">http://get.codlo.com/</a>.<br /><br /><br /></div></summary>

    <summary type="xhtml" xml:base="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/" xml:space="preserve"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brownies are a controversial subject. By varying the proportions of a few simple ingredients you can get drastically different outcomes. Which style of brownies do you prefer: Cake-like fluffiness or batter-like gooeyness? Take this Espresso Brownie recipe for example; it is a standard recipe that I have enhanced with a shot of espresso. The addition of two fluid ounces of espresso changes the consistency and the depth of flavor. It adds a barely perceptible nuanced layer to the chocolate flavor profile, making it richer and more delicious. The consistency changes too. If you like moist and gooey brownies, try this recipe!<br /><br /><i><a href="https://plus.google.com/113615183293449155482">Samantha Joyce</a> is a writer for <a href="http://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/">Seattle Coffee Gear</a> and enjoys sharing her knowledge of all things coffee.</i><br /><br /></div></summary>
