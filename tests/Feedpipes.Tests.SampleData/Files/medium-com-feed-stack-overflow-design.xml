            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>UX research snippets: How people are learning and teaching code</h3><p>🙋🏻‍♀️<em> Hello! Here at Stack Overflow, we recently started sharing UX research findings with our </em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-meta"><em>Meta community</em></a><em> to provide visibility into one of the inputs we use to make product decisions. </em><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ux-research-time"><em>You can see all past UX research updates here</em></a><em>, as well as </em><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data"><em>data science updates</em></a><em> from my colleague, Julia Silge. I’m cross-posting these findings to my personal blog.</em></p><p>Today, I’ll be talking about findings from user research we conducted about how people are <strong>learning to code</strong> and <strong>teaching others how to code</strong>.</p><h3>Research background</h3><p>This research was motivated by questions of how Stack Overflow may better serve people new to programming. More specifically:</p><ol><li>What motivates new developers to<strong> learn to code, and how are they learning</strong>? What tools or communities are they using, and what do their workflows look like?</li><li>How are code teachers <strong>teaching people to code</strong>? Any best practices, what resources do they share with their students, and what do their workflows look like?</li></ol><p>We conducted interviews with people sourced from our social networks and the community. Participants included people with less than 3 years of programming experience, a college Python instructor, Stack Overflow moderators and answerers, and leaders of various technology communities. Out of respect for people’s privacy, any quotes I’ve included here have been combined or paraphrased.</p><h3>What motivates new developers to learn to code, and how are they learning?</h3><p>The new coders I spoke to were <strong>driven to learn code so they could make career changes</strong>. They are self-taught and used a wide range of resources to learn, including online courses, YouTube videos, blogs, demos, and Twitter. They <strong>initiated their learning process via online courses</strong> (discovered via Google), and <strong>organically amassed resources over time</strong>.</p><blockquote><em>“I found resources by googling “learning to code python.” One of the resources I found showed me an online course. Then I found out about Code Academy. I’ve progressed from online courses to books to YouTube channels. The more confident I became, I [learned] that following tech people on Twitter is a great way to figure out how to get new resources.” — New coder, 3 years experience</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“I’m learning because I want to leave clinical medicine and go into research/policy analysis. I started using Datacamp last spring to learn R.” — New coder, 1 year experience</em></blockquote><p>New coders describe being overwhelmed at the beginning of their learning process — everything from <strong>vocabulary</strong> to the <strong>research process </strong>was new. This insight was strongly reflected in the experiences of those teaching code, who described the need to <strong>scaffold information</strong> for their students and to <strong>teach them how to gather information properly</strong>.</p><blockquote><em>“I take 5 min to find something, evaluate 30 pages, looked at 5, spend 1–2 min on each, and navigated to one. Whatever time it takes me to deal with it, it’ll take a novice 10x. If I have to go through 30 pages of search results then what do you expect of a novice? It takes learning to put natural language vocab to a coding question; those are words you don’t have yet.” — College instructor</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Sometimes you don’t even know what to search for. Sometimes copy and pasting an error helps, other times you come up with your own keyword search. When you’re learning it’s hard to know what to do… What people consider normal tech language can be super overwhelming. [On SO sometimes people say] ‘don’t ask questions you haven’t tried to find an answer for’. It would be nice if they could elaborate on ways to search the site.” — New coder, 1 year experience</em></blockquote><h3>What motivates people to teach and lead code communities, and how do they teach?</h3><p>Those teaching others to code are cautious about referring students to Stack Overflow. They described good teachers as being <strong>skilled in deconstructing student questions and scaffolding information</strong>.</p><blockquote><em>“Can you scaffold them to get there when teaching? You can’t just throw them the whole thing. I’m thinking about the problem differently than how a learner is learning about the problem. Can I try to understand the learners POV and how to break it down? What scaffolding will they need?” — Leader in technology community</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Students need a safe space to ask questions. A question from a novice is not just about technical clarification. A novice’s mental model is what has to be corrected… I usually caution against them using SO because the discussions there are working at a higher level than they need to be worrying about.” — College instructor</em></blockquote><p>People are incentivized to donate their time to Stack Overflow, open source communities, and teaching for philanthropic and practical reasons: <strong>to develop their careers, receive professional recognition, and to give back to communities that benefited them</strong>.</p><blockquote><em>“[I got involved in open source] because I wanted to engage in activities that signaled my professional credibility.” — Leader in technology community</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Some people have the time capacity and [like the] philanthropic aspects. Others will require more incentive. I usually [answer questions] to help out and as a resume builder.” — Stack Overflow answerer</em></blockquote><h3>Next steps</h3><p>This research is being used to help us to continue improving the guidance we provide to question askers. It’s also informing initiatives outside of the Community product team. If you’d like to participate in future user research sessions, you can join the research email list via your <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/email/settings/current">email settings</a>.</p><p>🤘Thanks for reading!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My hobby is coaching. I spend my evenings coaching youth and high school athletes in Track &amp; Field &amp; Cross Country.</p><p>I approach much of my design thinking in a similar manner as my coaching; prescribe appropriate frameworks to elicit a response, always look for opportunities of improvement, and be ready to adapt the toolkit to novel problems.</p><p>At Stack Overflow, I was tapped to lead our product team using <strong>design sprints</strong> to explore broad new concepts. We are specifically interested in helping developers grow by providing new ways for them to participate and connect on our platform.</p><p>In this lengthy article, I will talk about how we used design techniques to explore problems and test solutions quickly, and how I adapted a framework to creatively answer critical business questions facing our team.</p><h3><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3><p>Our team is remote. We have several different product segments and a very passionate and opinionated meta community. We also have many different stakeholders with strong opinions of how we can expand our services to developers and help them find better careers. Our product is tested, proven, and well known. So why upset that balance?</p><p>Our product team wanted to swing for the fences. We had tried several different design techniques in the past to move projects along ~ from <a href="http://gamestorming.com/whole-product-game/">whole product games</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034608000840">vision quests</a>. While these proved useful to generate a lot of ideas rapidly, they did not meet our needs when it came to validating key ideas or aligning the team on solutions.</p><p>Using <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/introduction/overview">Google’s Design Sprint Kit</a> as a backbone, we adapted their workflows to our unique remote circumstances.</p><p>Meetings that are supposed to be in person, now had to be remote. This required using tools in different ways.</p><p><strong>Tools we used:</strong> Trello, Figma, Google Documents, Hangouts, Respondent Screenflow, Github Pages, <a href="https://stackoverflow.design/">Stacks</a></p><p>We are also spread across the U.S. and all have different working hours.</p><p><strong>Locations &amp; Time Zones:</strong> Des (California), Max (New York City), Courtny (Indiana), Piper (Ohio), Kirti (New York City), Elaine (New York City)</p><h4><strong>The Sprint Plan</strong></h4><p>We had five days to work on our design sprint. This was an intentional and necessary time box. We wanted our team’s full attention and efforts focused to achieve the best outcome, while delivering maximum value.</p><p>Time is precious, so we were stingy during the sprint. We were even more aggressive and squished down the traditional 6 hour sessions into a 4 hour time block each day. We found that being remote and async allowed individuals to work individually within the rest of their workday as they deemed fit.</p><p>The initial plan consisted of 5 days. Each day was broken down into a “theme”.</p><p>Our schedule roughly looked like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Day 1: Create a shared understanding</strong></li><li><strong>Day 2: Brainstorm &amp; sketch all the thingz</strong></li><li><strong>Day 3: Decide what to build</strong></li><li><strong>Day 4: Build the damn thing</strong></li><li><strong>Day 5: Test it and see what people think</strong></li></ul><p>There are also different roles we filled during the sprint. <strong>It’s key to have a Sprint Lead, Decider, and a Technical expert.</strong> It was a bonus that we were able to have Marketing, Design, and User Research also involved.</p><ul><li><strong>Sprint Lead: </strong>The sprint lead facilitates and runs all of the sessions. The lead prepares all content, guides the team through exercises, and keeps everything on track and organized. In our situation, I served as the sprint lead.</li><li><strong>Decider: </strong>The decider role is very important. This person makes the final decisions on product direction and ideas. They need to listen to their team and be able to build consensus among team members. Aligning folks on shared vision is their goal during the sprint. We had one of our Talent Product Manager, Desiree Darilek serve as the decider during the sprint.</li><li><strong>Tech Expert(s): </strong>These people advise on technical matters, but also assist with building the final prototype. They are key members of all design activities.<strong> </strong>Max Horstmann &amp; Kirti Thorat, developers on the Talent product served in this role.</li><li><strong>Marketing Expert(s): </strong>Provided guidance on product positioning.<strong> </strong>Elaine Wang our Product Marketing Manager filled this spot.</li><li><strong>Design Expert(s): </strong>Gave guidance on user experience considerations, as well as helped with final designs for the prototype. Piper Lawson and I provided support here.</li><li><strong>User Research: </strong>Our resident research specialist, Kristina Lustig assisted us with all the planning for our user research sessions and facilitated the discussions with users on the final testing day.</li></ul><blockquote><em>The ideal team here is no more than 6–8 people. Too many people can stagnate decisions. The sprint’s goal is to reach decisions quickly, prototype those decisions, and test them.</em></blockquote><h3>Day 1: Shared Understanding</h3><p>Before we started our sprint, we needed to lay down ground rules for all involved and what the expectations were. We also needed to pick the brains of the subject matter experts we have in our company, and reflect on past research and activities.</p><h4>Set a long-term goal</h4><blockquote>“Why are we doing this project? Where do we want to be in 1 month, 6 months, or a year from now?”</blockquote><p>We spent time as a team discussing and understanding each other’s perspectives. It’s very important for each person to actively listen to one another. We designated a note taker so we could reflect on the discussion.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p><blockquote><strong>Our Ideal outcome</strong> — a strong direction for our product. How do we “10X” our offering to developers?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Problem</strong> — Can we provide more value back to our developers when it comes to engaging with companies, jobs, each other? Can developers enrich their careers and opportunities by using Stack Overflow? Will Stack Overflow be able to deliver on that vision?</blockquote><h4>Sprint questions</h4><p>Once our team had a shared understanding of each individuals perspectives, and we aligned on ideals and problems, we moved into identifying what questions we wanted to answer during the sprint.</p><p>Sprint questions are also a time to be honest as a team and identify what hurdles will be in your path as you try to innovate.</p><p>In our case, internal pressures and the desire to be conservative with our core product offering was identified as the biggest challenge to any new ideas we presented.</p><p>The core questions your team should be asking:</p><blockquote><strong>• What questions do we need to answer in this sprint?</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>• To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true?</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>• Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What could have caused that?</strong></blockquote><h4>Idea review</h4><p>We had a lot of previous research, archived design sessions, and insights to reflect on. We also have had failed projects from the past, and we want to learn from those mistakes.</p><p>Leaning on this previous knowledge gave us a head start on our solution, as well as helped us make more educated assumptions.</p><p>We were able to identify common trends and themes reappearing across all of these different pieces we had. Retroactively reviewing these findings, design documents, and conversations sped up our process and allowed old ideas to be brought back into the spotlight.</p><h4>Map your solutions</h4><p>Once the team identified the goals and failures, it was time to start thinking about possible solutions.</p><p>For most people I find that they already have a solution pre-baked into their head. It’s usually attached to a specific feature, or core feature but it is rarely completely detailed. Much less an end-to-end story.</p><blockquote>By providing your team with a structure you can begin to scaffold more detail.</blockquote><p>Our team chose to take a “story based” approach. Its a simple concept that most anyone can begin to break their solution down with.</p><p><strong>What’s the beginning, middle, and end of your story that solves our long term goal?</strong></p><p>Each individual took some time to prepare a short story. Then we presented to one another. The design sprint facilitator pulled together common themes and highlighted particularly strong ideas. The team worked together to build the narrative.</p><h4>Stakeholder Interviews</h4><p>Speaking with stakeholders about this shared story was the next step.</p><p>This was less of a presentation of the team’s work, and more about our team asking questions that filled in the gaps of the story. These people helped our team identify pitfalls, reflect on old initiatives, and uncover additional opportunities.</p><p>When doing this session, here are a few tips.</p><p>Take the time to be opinionated about the product direction. Assume brand new features exist that help tell your story. As an example, you might ask an ads stakeholder: <em>“In what ways do you think companies would want to promote their content </em><strong><em>[we do not have this today]</em></strong><em>? Do we feel like this would be intrusive to the user’s experience </em><strong><em>[meta may dislike it]</em></strong><em>? Why and why not?</em><strong><em>[help the Stackholder consider both sides]</em></strong><em>”</em></p><p>Asking hypothetical questions allows you to temper new ideas rapidly with these key people, and also gets their minds working to address new <em>(and sometimes potentially disruptive)</em> ideas.</p><blockquote>For our company, these are the team members and product areas we had represented:</blockquote><blockquote>• Puneet Mulchandani &amp; Sean Bave— Talent strategy</blockquote><blockquote>• Noah Meiri &amp; Yi Shan — Ads</blockquote><blockquote>• Joe Friend — DAG context, what’s the mindset</blockquote><blockquote>• JNat — Dev community, Cogro/Meta mindset</blockquote><blockquote>• Donna Choi— Dev community, user motivations (Public Q&amp;A, Teams, Jobs)</blockquote><h4>Homework: Product Teardowns</h4><p>At the conclusion of the day, we broke down as individuals to work quietly. We asked each individual to find products and services that could serve as an inspiration for this design sprint. Each person was to prepare to share their homework on Day 2.</p><h3>Day 2: Brainstorming &amp; Sketching</h3><p>On day two the team members were focused on creating a design solution sketch by the end of the day. This is basically a visual representation of the core features that will bring our story outlined in Day 1 to life. Day 2 was composed of activities that helped focus the team on rapidly generating a lot of ideas and exploring them.</p><h4>Review &amp; Refine Story</h4><p>We started off the day reviewing the long term goal, sprint questions, solutions map, and all the expert interviews. Was there anything that we should change in our story based on those sessions?</p><h4>Lightning Demos</h4><p>For the lightning demos, we compiled a list of all the products and services people brought to show and tell. We had each individual give a 3-minute tour of the product or service, and highlight exactly what features are standout to them.</p><p>For these lightning demos, each team member presented on Google Hangouts, while a note taker compiled all of the interesting features and concepts each person covered.</p><h4>Sketch</h4><p>The sketching activities took up the majority of the day. Here we chose to focus on a couple of different sketch activities, although there are several methods for your team to try and use. We chose to use “How Might We’s”, “Crazy 8&#39;s” and then move onto the Design Solution Sketches.</p><p><strong>Beginning with How Might We’s</strong> allowed us to take the problems we would face and pose them as opportunities for design. This is a common design activity that guides people to believe the answer is out there, may or may not work, and reminds people that the sprint is about teamwork and riffing on other’s ideas. The team is working to create opportunities versus narrowing down solutions too early.</p><p>Our team came up with a couple of broad “How Might We” statements, and then began providing their individual solutions for each.</p><p><em>How Might We examples:</em></p><ul><li><strong>How might we curate content?</strong></li><li><strong>How might we introduce new content types?</strong></li><li><strong>How might we guide developers careers?</strong></li><li><strong>How might we connect the developers and employers?</strong></li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sepZt4zdcPEf93q2zzTuXQ.png" /><figcaption><strong>How Might We’s organized on a Trello board</strong></figcaption></figure><p>This activity spawned many ideas, but even more rich conversations and exploration about how we may execute. This was precisely what we were going for! Seeing everyone’s HMW’s opened the field for discussion. We then started organizing each of the HMW’s into broader category buckets so we could see some of the common ideas our team shared.</p><p>In fact, this exercise took so much time we did not get the chance to dive into Crazy 8’s sketching. This wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. The Crazy 8’s exercise is in place to challenge team members to rapidly sketch 8 distinct ideas on paper. This wasn’t mission critical since our team was aligning behind some of the shared ideas being presented during the HMW exercise.</p><p>One comment here as the facilitator is: don’t shut down good, productive discussion. Our team was really on a roll creating and detailing some of the HMW themes. So I called an audible and let us go an hour longer on that segment to make sure we captured everyone’s thoughts and insights.</p><p>We ended the How Might We session by allowing each team member to vote on their favorite HMW cards on the Trello board. Each individual only got three votes, and with nearly 60+ different ideas this was difficult. However, it forced each individual to focus on the core story they wanted to tell and that they felt emphasized our goals as a team.</p><p>We began to see alignment.</p><p>We then closed off the day creating our <strong>Solution Sketches</strong>. This activity focused on defining the key visuals of product ideas in action. The team members would create a sketch focused on the major keyframes that would need to exist for their solution to be brought to life. Once their sketches were completed, they emailed them to me where they were compiled into a single Figma document.</p><p>Some things to keep in mind while doing a solution sketch:</p><ul><li><strong>Make it self-explanatory.</strong> It needs to explain itself without you presenting it. If people can’t understand it on it’s own, then it probably won’t make sense when it’s polished either.</li><li><strong>Keep it anonymous.</strong> Don’t put your name on the sketch. We want to evaluate ideas — not people.</li><li><strong>Ugly is fine.</strong> The sketch doesn’t have to be fancy and polished. It just needs to have enough detail, be thoughtful, and complete.</li><li><strong>Words matter.</strong> Don’t use “text will go here” headlines. Think about the copy you would use. Strong writing is an important product element.</li><li><strong>Give it a catchy title.</strong> The title helps us keep track of the different solutions. It’s also a way of drawing attention to your big idea.</li></ul><h4>Bonus: Lightning Research Interviews</h4><p>We had the luxury of testing these solution sketches, and receive some early user reactions to them. This was a luxury because it provided some great high level feedback and insights moving into Day 3 where we decide on a final design to prototype. This was done completely remote and reminded me a lot of testing paper prototypes with users in person.</p><h3>Day 3: Deciding</h3><p>Decision day is the most critical to the sprint. This is the day your team will decide on what to ultimately build and test in order to answer your sprint questions.</p><p>Before our team dug in, we spent time at the beginning of the day reviewing work to date. This was a good time to collect comments and feedback on the brainstorm and sketching activities you did previously so we could improve that process in the future.</p><h4><strong>Heat Mapping the Design Solutions</strong></h4><p>Our first activity of the day was reviewing the design solutions each team member created. This review session was coupled with a heat mapping exercise and speed critique session.</p><p>All of the sketches were placed into one Figma document that was shared with all team members. Team members design solutions were kept anonymous from one another. Each team member was asked to do the following heat mapping exercise:</p><ul><li>Don’t talk.</li><li>Look at a solution sketch.</li><li>Put dots besides parts that you like, commenting with a simple “+1”</li><li>If you really like an idea, put 2 or 3 “+1”.</li><li>Comment on parts you really like.</li><li>If you have a concern or question, comment on that part.</li><li>Move on to the next sketch, and repeat.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NI-oSIzy2n_qrf1zXJX91Q.png" /><figcaption><strong>Design solutions placed into a Figma document allowed for multiplayer polling, commenting, and discussion.</strong></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Speed Critiquing the Design Solutions</strong></h4><p>Once the heat map was completed, we moved onto the speed critique.</p><p>The overall goal of this session was to create a record of promising ideas for the prototype. We didn’t need to debate if they should be included, we just presented each idea. This was a purposefully focused time period (30 minutes) and it helped to have a dedicated note taker, allowing the sprint leader to narrate the solutions to the team.</p><p>For each design solution we did the following:</p><ul><li>Set a timer for three minutes.</li><li>The sprint lead narrated the sketch.</li><li>The sprint lead called out standout ideas that have +1’s around a theme.</li><li>The team noted any ideas the sprint lead missed.</li><li>The note taker wrote down the standout ideas and gave each idea a simple name, such as “Animated Video” or “One-step Signup”.</li><li>Review concerns and suggestions that were noted.</li><li>The solution creator remained silent until the end. (“Creator, reveal your identity and tell us what we missed!”)</li><li>The solution creator revealed any missed ideas that the team failed to spot, and answered any questions.</li><li>The user researcher shared the feedback provided by users during the lightning interviews</li><li>Move on to the next design solution, repeat.</li></ul><h4>Straw Poll</h4><p>Once we finished critique, we moved into aligning concepts. This activity focuses on getting folks on the same page.</p><p>We reviewed our <strong>long term goal</strong> as well as <strong>sprint questions</strong>. We were looking to identify the big, risky ideas that would have potential.</p><p>Each team member was asked to write down their favorite ideas shown during the critique. This could be an entire solution, or pieces from different solutions stitched together.</p><p>Once everyone was done, we went around to each individual and revealed their choices and they explained their votes.</p><p>Ultimately, it is the Decider who determines what ideas the team will explore in the prototype. This is all based on input from the team, but the decider is there to solve any disputes and get the team aligned on the solutions to be explored.</p><blockquote>Des (our Decider) helped us identify what we wanted to focus on as a team:</blockquote><blockquote>• Introduce new content types for exploration</blockquote><blockquote>• Figure out how we can curate content for users.</blockquote><blockquote>• Enhancements to company pages</blockquote><h4><strong>Prototype Storyboard</strong></h4><p>Our team now had solid direction for the prototype. The task now became breaking these high level concepts down into executable steps. This is the time we began to figure out exactly what the prototype would look like.</p><p>Here’s what we did:</p><ol><li><strong>Decide who the “storyboard artist” will be.</strong> This is the person(s) responsible for writing, note taking, and sketching ideas the team comes up with. We used a combination of Google Document + Figma to assemble the storyboard and any accompanying sketches.</li><li><strong>Create up to 10 storyboard frames. </strong>You can always use less, but max it out at ten.<strong> </strong>This will help to figure out how a user will experience the prototype, while also keeping the scope tight.</li></ol><p>Imagine an opening scene for the prototype. What would be the natural starting point for users? An example opening scene: <strong>“User clicks through a new post on Hacker News titled <em>Stack Overflow introduces new community features</em>”.</strong></p><p>It was important to keep the following in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Work with what we have.</strong> Resist inventing new ideas. Work with the ideas we have already come up with.</li><li><strong>Don’t write copy together.</strong> Either use headlines from the sketches or defer copywriting until tomorrow.</li><li><strong>Include just enough detail.</strong> The storyboard should include just enough detail that nobody asks “what happens next?” or “what goes here?”, but don’t get too specific. It doesn’t need to be perfect today. We can decide this tomorrow.</li><li><strong>The Decider decides.</strong> Ultimately the Decider makes all final decisions. If we reach an impasse, we defer to the Decider and move on.</li><li><strong>When in doubt, take risks.</strong> The sprint is for testing risky ideas with huge payoffs. Skip the easy wins for bold bets. This isn’t the time to be conservative.</li><li><strong>Keep it to 15 minutes or less.</strong> This will ensure we don’t overbuild and it will help us make sure we leave enough time for customers to think aloud and answer questions.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VRnj8owEqeJio1C-k_DkZQ.jpeg" /><figcaption><strong>Storyboarding involved hand sketches, Google Documents, and Invision boards for collecting inspiration.</strong></figcaption></figure><h3>Day 4: Build the Prototype</h3><p>Now the team moves onto the build phase. It is here that the designers and developers involved in the sprint work together to breathe life into the sketches and documents created by the team. Their efforts provide the tangible vision to test with users.</p><p>We started off the morning with a quick check-in; assigning roles and breaking down tasks.</p><p>Our team decided to build the prototype using our user interface library, <a href="https://stackoverflow.design/">Stacks</a> and depended on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to serve the content. Using Github allowed the designers and developers to collaborate on the project as it was being built.</p><h3><strong>Day 5: User Testing</strong></h3><p>Day 5 is when our team placed our vision in front of users.</p><p><strong>Our prototype was ready and publicly accessible.</strong></p><p>We were very interested in seeing their reactions to the project we had completed. The insights we gained from these sessions would inform the net big steps for our product.</p><p>Given the developer focus of Stack Overflow, we recruited seven developers of varying experience levels and familiarity with Stack Overflow to test with. Kristina Lustig ran our research sessions and provided a script to walk each of our users through.</p><p>Sprint team members were encouraged to sit in on the sessions, and were allowed to hear the user’s feedback and see the reactions to the prototype.</p><h3>Wrapping it all up: Findings</h3><p>Following the research sessions, our team walked away with several findings that we could use. While we weren’t provided a definitive strategy, we did spot major recurring themes that will inform our product trajectory.</p><p>As the sprint lead, it was my responsibility to wrap up insights from the research into a nice package.</p><h3>Closing</h3><p>Leading a design sprint is intense. It requires a lot of preparation and active participation by everyone in the sprint.</p><p>This can lead to exhaustion. Providing adequate breaks between sessions was important. Each day we got better at monitoring when to take a break, let the mind rest, and come back fueled up and ready to tackle the next batch of work.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to take the traditional design sprint model and tweak it to your teams needs. Adapting the processes with some handy collaboration tools helped us bridge the physical-digital divide.</p><p>I am optimistic about Stack Overflow using this model more in our product development process.</p><p>It has certainly been a beneficial experience for our product team, and it was fun to go outside the box and think big!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5c0dc79dea31" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design/remote-design-sprinting-at-stack-overflow-5c0dc79dea31">Remote design sprinting at Stack Overflow</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design">Stack Overflow Design</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Stack Overflow email management: a UX case study</strong></h3><p>If you have an email account, you’ve probably received a product email at some point. Chances are that your experience fell into one of these buckets:</p><ol><li>The email was helpful and relevant. Managing your emails was dead simple.</li><li>The email wasn’t really helpful and only sort of relevant. It was mostly easy to opt-in or out of emails, but some settings were vague or hidden behind a login wall.</li><li>The email was irrelevant, even misleading. It was difficult to opt-out; in fact, you’re <em>still </em>receiving emails about this product after hitting “unsubscribe from all” countless times.</li></ol><p>Stack Overflow’s email experience has hovered around #2 — the emails we sent were mostly relevant, but management features were scattered and neglected in dark, dusty corners of the product. As we started to send more emails, there was a risk that we’d slide into #3 unless we made some major improvements.</p><p>Our team set out to fix this experience, and here’s my take on our process.</p><p>This is the second in a <a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design/designing-a-better-email-preference-center-4fddd44b91b5">two-part</a> series about how we overhauled Stack Overflow’s email management UX.</p><h3>A quick history of email at Stack Overflow</h3><p>Up until a year ago, Stack Overflow didn’t send much email. There were a few emails sent to highly active Q&amp;A users, plus emails for basic things like resetting your password or verifying your email address. The assumption was that users didn’t want or need emails from us. If they wanted to hear from us, they could visit the site.</p><p>This assumption was true for some users — particularly highly active Q&amp;A users, who are already visiting the site regularly to moderate or participate in question threads. However, this is a small, expert slice of users. The majority of users visit irregularly to get answers, find a job, or learn about an interesting topic — and might miss content that would otherwise be interesting or beneficial to them.</p><p>In fact, as we dug into metrics and user feedback, we found that users responded pretty positively to (relevant) email. Our assumptions about email started to shift and broaden, and we began lining up more email projects across the product.</p><p>As more emails were sent, experience problems — particularly around email management — became increasingly apparent. To understand these problems, let’s back up and talk about the structure of Stack Overflow.</p><p>Stack Overflow is a product for developers. It’s composed of our flagship Q&amp;A feature, Jobs (a job board for programming &amp; programming-related jobs), a business entity, and Stack Exchange (a network of 150+ community sites on topics ranging from web security to cooking).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3_FJYi35PDicUIVS1woLpw.png" /></figure><p>The product serves over 5 million users with varied tasks including (but not limited to):</p><ol><li>Answering someone else’s programming question</li><li>Finding an answer to a cooking question</li><li>Finding a job</li><li>Building a new community around a topic like <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/113400/pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</a>.</li></ol><p>Depending on the tasks and sites that a user engaged with, they’d need to visit three or more pages on disparate sites to manage their emails. Some of these pages were behind a login wall, and none were mobile-friendly. It was hard for users to know <em>what</em> they were subscribed to (or unsubscribed from). Some settings were synced across all sites, and others were not.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-80noHDxP1ejLPuFGyex5A.png" /><figcaption>Various email management pages that a user might have encountered.</figcaption></figure><p>There were also major infrastructure problems that made improvements to our email sending and managing system costly to implement and difficult to measure, such as poor tracking, limited A/B testing capabilities, and a fragile deployment system.</p><h3>Defining goals</h3><p>The UX goal was simple: create an honest, clear, and easy-to-use email management system for users regardless of:</p><ul><li>What tasks they were completing;</li><li>What sites they were using;</li><li>Whether they were logged in or not; and</li><li>What device they were using.</li></ul><p>Side note: implementing a more robust email sending &amp; tracking system was a significant part of this project, but this case study will focus on the above UX goal only.</p><h3>Conducting preliminary research</h3><p>We started with an audit of our existing emails: what they said, where they came from, what conditions triggered them, and how they were grouped. This helped us broadly understand use cases and problem areas.</p><p>We then conducted an analysis of email management solutions on other sites.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K2_OyBy2-I-9KrTuT3YUqA.png" /><figcaption>We analyzed email management solutions on sites like Duolingo, Redfin, and Litmus.</figcaption></figure><p>The goal was to learn from standards and insights already gained by other companies with similar needs. When analyzing these experiences, we asked questions like:</p><ul><li>What do the best experiences have in common?</li><li>What experiences reflect or contradict our principles?</li><li>What are the paths per use case (eg. logged in vs. logged out), device, and task? How, if at all, do they differ?</li></ul><p>We then cobbled together this research, existing data, and past user feedback in order to identify and prioritize pain points.</p><h3>Defining pain points</h3><p><strong>Pain Point #1: Managing emails on your phone was really hard</strong>. Users attempting to manage their email settings from their phones were simply sent to the desktop site, where they were expected to pinch and zoom in order to change — or even see — their email settings. This presented usability and accessibility problems for a significant subset of users, since our data indicated that a large slice of email engagement occurred on mobile.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/938/1*n7damMOqOMOM9reC7hTWvQ.png" /></figure><p>This one might seem obvious in a <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/a-hands-on-guide-to-mobile-first-design/">mobile first</a> world, but Stack Overflow has historically centered around Q&amp;A, where users are writing code, reading and writing content, and testing code. These tasks overwhelmingly take place on desktop computers. The introduction of email grew mobile traffic — and consequently, led to more mobile investment.</p><p><strong>Pain Point #2: You needed to login to manage or unsubscribe from some emails. </strong>If attempting to manage email settings while logged-out — perhaps while using a work computer or phone — users were sometimes blocked by a login wall.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vWGihFO9GSRXwUm9MitXug.png" /></figure><p><strong>Pain Point #3: Email settings were confusing and inconsistent across sites. </strong>In some cases, users needed to visit three or more pages on different domains to manage their emails. Some settings were synced across all 150+ sites, while others were site-specific — and it was hard to know one from the other.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*boJmJLSerhiwlD-qG9f8bw.png" /></figure><p><strong>Pain Point #4: Email groups — and which address they sent to — were confusing. </strong>For example, users opted-in to the bucket pictured below were eligible to receive emails like beta feature invites, online event reminders, and notifications about their reputation milestones — something that wasn’t immediately clear. In some cases, those emails send to a different address than the one displayed on this page.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Txs0Jrznd6qdXqpzGQodhQ.png" /></figure><h3>Designing and testing the solution</h3><p>We went through several design iterations before arriving at the solution. Each design iteration surfaced risks and open questions, which we explored through hallway and usability testing. Here’s our solution.</p><p><strong>A touch-friendly mobile design. </strong>This addresses the difficulty of managing emails on mobile. A reusable toggle UI, which is both touch and desktop-friendly, can reduce implementation cost for future cross-device projects.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rrIeA0Uq-hASZKxA3Wa7nQ.png" /></figure><p><strong>One-click unsubscribe and management for <em>all</em> users and emails. </strong>Even if you’re logged out, you can control all of your emails easily.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MJH9nbkVIy7eY551prOUww.png" /></figure><p><strong>Clear, consistent design across all network sites</strong>. This reduces the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/">cognitive load</a> of processing different design patterns when completing similar, or identical tasks. Multi-site vs. site-specific email settings are clearly organized and communicated to the user.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*39-Fq6xbavBgz57XUzPpOA.png" /></figure><p><strong>Emails grouped based on common characteristics. </strong>We remapped emails and added new groups like Research and Tips &amp; Reminders. Succinct, scannable copy and design makes it clear what you are subscribing and unsubscribing from.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OwvMkHY7uLA53jnnX-e34A.png" /></figure><h3>Takeaways</h3><p>Email management is one factor in our experiences with product emails. There are still plenty of improvements to make as we scale up email efforts — for example, it’s not only important that management is useful and easy, but that the emails themselves are those things and more — relevant, timely, and respectful. This also brings up questions about other communication channels that might be helpful to users, like in-product or mobile notifications.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lessons and insights from redesigning Stack Overflow’s email preferences.</em></p><p>Hi. I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/TedGoas">Ted</a> and I’m on the Product Design team at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, a place where developers can get answers to their programming questions, find a job, and build communities around similar interests. Like many other websites, Stack Overflow sends email. Earlier this year, we set out to explore how we could improve our email experience. We’d love to share what we learned in the process.</p><p>This is the first in a two part series about how we’re overhauling Stack Overflow’s email subscription UX.</p><h3>The Current State of Email Preference Centers</h3><p>When I hear folks talk about email, usually it goes something like this:</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>Want to receive unwanted emails for the rest of your life, and possibly the life of your children?

Sometimes it seems like you mysteriously get on an email list and have to jump through hoops to get off.</p><p>Until about a year ago, Stack Overflow didn’t send much email aside from a few messages sent to active Q&amp;A users and basic things like resetting a password. We’ve been working hard to ramp up Stack Overflow’s email program and send better targeted emails. As our email program evolved, we knew our email preferences needed to keep pace. Our existing design wasn’t going to cut it, so we set out to redesign Stack Overflow’s email preference center.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Kx0w1U4t4HRfqgmo." /><figcaption>We can do better</figcaption></figure><h3>Our Goal</h3><p>First, we needed to fix our legacy system in order to avoid becoming the bad actor ourselves. Designing for a community that connects over 50 million developers can pose some unique challenges. We created a few <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">design principles</a> to help guide our ideas for Stack Overflow’s email preference center:</p><ol><li><strong>Be honest</strong> about what’s happening.</li><li><strong>Be clear</strong> about what’s possible.</li><li><strong>Be quick</strong> in removing roadblocks and honoring users’ wishes.</li></ol><h3>Common Pitfalls (and what we did to solve them)</h3><h4>Pitfall #1: Inundating folks with emails after signup</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*Ub1YM-pCSxXcbbrj." /><figcaption>Aww hell no!</figcaption></figure><p>How many times have you joined a new service and gotten opted into EVERY SINGLE EMAIL THEY SEND? Yeah, we didn’t want to be that guy… but at the same time, we were underselling ourselves by playing it too conservative with email. Users frequently made comments like “Oh I didn’t know you had x/y/z feature.” Rather than just not send any email at all, we had to convince ourselves that we could do it in a responsible way.</p><blockquote><em>One of my biggest apprehensions is annoying our community. Worrying about that keeps me up at night. — </em><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/how-we-make-money-at-stack-overflow-2016-edition/">Nick Craver</a></blockquote><p>We reorganized our email categories and reconsidered how folks are opted into each one. We made email subscriptions trigger-based wherever possible. For example, we don’t send you any Jobs emails until you engage with the Jobs product (apply for a job, set status to ‘looking’, etc.). We don’t send you any community emails until you’ve participated. We don’t opt you into any newsletters. And no, we don’t employ any pop-ups imploring you (or shaming you) to sign up. We don’t even have an email signup form on most pages.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*w9rOPwjIW3PXsXNl." /><figcaption>Our email footer</figcaption></figure><p>And when we <em>do</em> email you, we tell you why. Every email includes <em>a reason</em> you got email. We watched our language and made sure our internal speak didn’t end up in the text (such as “Profile merge expired,” “Active status decayed,” and other glorious names we give emails at Stack Overflow).</p><p>Lastly, we do our best to remove folks who probably don’t want to be emailed. If an email is rejected, we’ll unsubscribe you. If you’re unresponsive to emails we send, we’ll unsubscribe you. If you mark it as spam, we’ll unsubscribe you. We want to keep in touch, but only in ways that you find helpful.</p><p><strong>TAKEAWAY:<br>Be honest:</strong> We’re careful about not emailing anyone who doesn’t want to hear from us. If we’re not sure, we don’t send the email.</p><h4>Pitfall #2: Sending poorly targeted emails</h4><p>So many times, I sign up for a service and get an email I didn’t expect.</p><blockquote>“Where did this come from?”</blockquote><blockquote>“What did I do to receive this?”</blockquote><blockquote>“How do I change my preferences?”</blockquote><p>When a preference center gives me a lot of options, I want to know what exactly each of those options actually means. A list of vague categories like “Announcements” or “Product Updates” doesn’t set clear expectations about what email I’d receive and how often I’d receive them.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*5Gj1cOMLIXzwyqKp." /><figcaption>What… exactly are these?</figcaption></figure><p>Same goes for when I receive an email. So many times, I’ve arrived at a preferences page after clicking “unsubscribe” in an email and have no idea which email I just turned off. It’s often hard to tell exactly what category controls a certain email, so I have to guess and disable certain message types until I stop getting the ones I don’t want any more.</p><p>We addressed this by including a brief explanation of each email category. Where possible, we say how often we send an email. We try to be as clear as possible so a user may edit their preferences with confidence.</p><p>If the unsubscribe link is clicked in any email, we bring you to your email preferences with that email highlighted so it’s clear what you just unsubscribed from. Regardless of how you end up in your email preferences, we want your experience to be as good as possible.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/0*A1bkkhgAfSTX3Npq." /></figure><p>Stack Overflow highlights the email you unsubscribed from so you don’t have to guess.</p><p><strong>TAKEAWAY</strong>:<br><strong>Be clear:</strong> We describe each email and highlight important actions so users know what’s going on.</p><h4>Pitfall #3: Poor, Inaccessible Email UX</h4><p>When updating your email preferences, how many times have you been forced to…</p><ul><li>…log into a site or app?</li><li>…navigate a non-responsive site on mobile?</li><li>…make sense of confusing text?</li><li>…type your email address (on mobile)?</li><li>…confirm an unsubscribe?</li><li>…wait a week for it to process?</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*7Xru1NmTWZeGPhxr." /><figcaption>This is where I mark emails as spam.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>There is nothing worse than making the user do more than completely necessary when it comes to trying to remove themselves from communications.- </em><a href="https://medium.com/@Conversio/sorting-out-our-email-marketing-opt-ins-223ca92483e7#.awwrvphxz">Becs Rivett-Kemm</a></blockquote><p>We think of this as any other conversion. If we optimize the landing pages from our emails, why not our subscription preferences? Unsubscribing might not be a flow we want them to complete, but if that’s what someone wants to do we shouldn’t make it any harder than it has to be.</p><p>We provide a one-click unsubscribe wherever we can. We did a lot of discovery and prototyping on when to include an unsubscribe link in email footers; it’s not always clear! For instance, we researched the<strong> Welcome Email</strong> for 15 websites and found only about half included an unsubscribe link.</p><p>You can edit most of your Stack Overflow emails on a phone, without logging in, with a single click or tap.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong><em>Lessons learned from creating and maintaining a modestly successful open source project.</em></strong></h4><p><em>This article is adapted from a talk I gave at the Stack Overflow Design Meetup In July 2017.</em></p><p>Before we start, a few quick bits:</p><ol><li>You don’t need to know how to code to do open source.</li><li>Open source doesn’t have to require a lot of time.</li><li>This article is focused on maintaining your own project. Contributing to others’ projects is also important, but I won’t cover that here.</li><li>Open source projects can lead to pleasant surprises. I’ve used mine as leverage to get pay raises and at least one speaking gig.</li></ol><p>I’m a designer. In 2013 I created <a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">Cerberus</a>, a set of simple HTML email templates that solve a lot of common gotchas in getting emails to display properly across email clients. I have a few open source projects, but Cerberus is my main jam. It’s been used by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2839730-A-Litmus-Love-Story">the team at dribbble</a>, and is included in products like Dreamweaver and <a href="https://litmus.com/email-builder">Litmus Builder</a>.</p><p>In this article, I’d like to share a few tips that guide my open source work and show a few examples of some awesome open source projects.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ArN0PxSQuq4zaPVe21vL5Q.png" /></figure><h3>1. Choose Something Timeless and Stick With It</h3><p>There’s a saying that certain jobs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession-proof_job">recession-proof</a>. I’m not suggesting every open source project should survive the nuclear apocalypse, but there are certainly parallels. A project should be something that can evolve through paradigm shifts. Something trendy like a long-shadow generator is probably not a good bet, but so many projects end up needing <a href="https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/">a good tooltip</a> at some point.</p><p>For me, email is an obvious choice. Email is mature, ubiquitous, and has proven staying power… no matter how many people proclaim that email is dead. When I started Cerberus, I worked on it slowly and steadily for a few years before anyone started noticing it. And that’s ok, because email’s gonna be around for a while.</p><h3><strong>2. Make It Small and Focused</strong></h3><p>I have a full-time job, a young family, own a house, and enjoy life away from screens. I mostly work on my project alone, so it’s important not to spread myself too thin. I resist building bells and whistles; they’re more to maintain. I minimize dependencies; they’re roadblocks for folks getting started. I’ve left the design open for folks to adapt it for their own needs.</p><blockquote>Cerberus is a few simple, but solid patterns for responsive HTML emails.</blockquote><p><a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">That’s what’s on the tin</a>. Cerberus’s design is grayscale, uses placeholder images, and contains dummy text. It doesn’t even define a font. It’s intentionally simple and unassuming. It does just a few things but it does them really well. Well, that’s the goal anyway.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OfTAq8_8-Jlo6dQNuSUHYg.png" /><figcaption>Cerberus (in all it’s beauty)</figcaption></figure><p>When considering new features, I think about 37Signals’s “<a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php">Start with No</a>” in Getting Real. A while back, I was asked to extend Cerberus’s three-column layout to support four columns.</p><blockquote><strong>GitHub-User:</strong> Hi, can you please make a four column layout?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Me:</strong> Hmm, that’s possible. Can you tell me a little about what you need it for?</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><p>I got no response. Building a four column layout was totally possible, but I never built it because it wasn’t important enough to this person. No one’s asked for it since.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QKrF5BQXSHwvxt8FH3htWw.jpeg" /></figure><p><em>It’s like Fight Club. You should only consider features if they’re willing to stand on the porch for three days waiting to be let in.</em></p><h3><strong>3. Dogfood It</strong></h3><p>This might go without saying, but using my own project helps me understand how it can be used so common workflows can be optimized. Email has been part of nearly every project I’ve worked on in the past few years, so I reach for Cerberus quite often.</p><p>Dogfooding it helps…</p><ul><li>find and fix bugs in dark corners</li><li>write documentation</li><li>educate and offer tips on how best to adapt and extend the project</li></ul><h3><strong>4. Work on Non-Visible Features</strong></h3><p>I designed for a healthcare company for six years. Our work was heavily regulated (HIPAA) and we had strict privacy and security protocols. Every so often, I’d search for a plugin or tool to solve a problem. I usually found something that did the trick, but it would violate U.S. healthcare regulations.</p><blockquote><em>Well $@*#… can’t use this one!</em></blockquote><p>I had a lot of these moments. It was very frustrating.</p><p>But it made me appreciate things like accessibility, download speed, industry-specific compliance (higher education, healthcare, government, etc.), and browser / device support. I don’t want to knowingly exclude folks from being able to use my project.</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>The world doesn&#39;t need new and innovative interaction patterns as much as designers believe. It just needs shit to work.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/gem_ray/status/481855135610847233">@gem_ray</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height); resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><h3><strong>5. Double-Down on Documentation</strong></h3><p>As amazingly self-documenting as I think my project is… yea, it’s really not. Prioritizing documentation makes a project more approachable and understandable. I try to remind myself that no one is in my brain but me (I hope). All those decisions I made in my head may as well not even exist to anyone else unless they’re documented somewhere.</p><ul><li>A decent <a href="https://github.com/LappleApple/feedmereadmes/blob/master/README-maturity-model.md">readme</a> helps people get up and running.</li><li>Documentation helps explain why things work the way they do.</li><li>Code comments are good for for granular things.</li><li>Good commit messages explain what changed, when, and why.</li><li>Thoughtful discussions in GitHub issues and pull requests explain what ideas were considered and why they were implemented (or not implemented).</li><li>Demos help visualize results.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*odGzeWYoSXv-442YOZ2UiQ.png" /><figcaption><em>Screenshot of Cerberus’s code; the dark gray text is code comments.</em></figcaption></figure><h3><strong>6. Include Instructions on How to Contribute</strong></h3><p>As my project matured, it started to get a little attention. As folks started using it, they had ideas on how to fix stuff or add to the project. This is a great thing, though I hit a few stumbling blocks in the beginning because I didn’t specify any contribution guidelines. So I’d occasionally get messages like this:</p><blockquote><strong>GitHub-User:</strong> Hey, I found and fixed a bug in a template. Here’s a pull request!</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Me:</strong> Thank you very much! Hey, Cerberus is actually <em>three</em> templates, would you mind fixing the other two?</blockquote><p>People didn’t know how to help because I didn’t tell them. face-palm-dot-gif</p><p>I created some <a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/#contribute">contribution guidelines</a> in the project’s docs to help steer the project in the direction I wanted to see it go and direct help where it’s needed most. So I don’t get a pull request out of nowhere with some changes I don’t want.</p><h3><strong>Examples!!</strong></h3><p>Alright, enough advice. Here are a few simple, focused, and well-documented open source projects I keep coming back to.</p><h4><a href="https://backgrounds.cm/"><strong>Bulletproof Background Images in Email</strong></a></h4><p>Getting background images to display in email clients takes a lot of code that I’ll never memorize. This project provides a few options and spits out working code that can be pasted into any email template. It does this <em>one</em> thing <em>really</em> well.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QkkU7C3iTfEZlMiQ1sZOpQ.png" /><figcaption>Backgrounds.cm by Campaign Monitor</figcaption></figure><h4><a href="https://yeun.github.io/open-color/"><strong>Open Color</strong></a></h4><p>This project researched a color palette optimized for interfaces. It’s been tested for things like accessibility, brightness, and contrast across a range of different screens. The whole project is colors. That’s all it is. Brilliant.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dA7aicftWsBDKf0J9AhOxg.png" /><figcaption>Open Color by heeyeun</figcaption></figure><h4><a href="https://github.com/phanan/htaccess"><strong>.htaccess Snippets</strong></a></h4><p>I don’t know if I’d ever edited an .htaccess without bringing an entire site down… until I found this project. The entire project is the readme.md file, which contains paste-able snippets of common .htaccess commands. I’ll reference this until the day we hire an .htaccess programmer 😆.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tCjBLKmPsEBV6KHD01VnIQ.png" /><figcaption>.htaccess snippets by Phan An</figcaption></figure><h4><a href="https://gist.github.com/malarkey/4031110"><strong>Contract Killer</strong></a></h4><p>Contract Killer is a popular open source contract for web professionals that translates confusing legal passages into layman’s terms. The entire project is a text document in a GitHub Gist. A contract is part of any freelance project I take on, so I’ve adapted my own version that I use each time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Eq_AkpeRVudZGsCqLPmx1g.png" /><figcaption>Contract Killer by Andy Clarke</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Wrapping up</strong></h3><p>I’m so happy you made it this far! So, to recap:</p><ul><li>Choose something timeless.</li><li>Keep it small and focused.</li><li>Use it yourself.</li><li>Invest in good documentation.</li><li>Guide folks on how to contribute.</li></ul><p>Are you grinding on an open source project? Thinking about starting one? I’d love to know if you found something in here useful. Please leave a comment or ping me <a href="https://twitter.com/TedGoas">on Twitter</a>. On the off-chance you’ve used Cerberus in a project, I’d love to hear about it! ✌️</p><p>Also published at <a href="http://www.tedgoas.com/blog/open-source">http://www.tedgoas.com/blog/open-source</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9de60ce54e62" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design/anyone-can-open-source-9de60ce54e62">Anyone Can Open Source!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design">Stack Overflow Design</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That was this week’s topic. Whether within our product teams, the company, or the 40+ million visitors to Stack Overflow every month; we need to remind ourselves that biggest part of our job as designers isn’t pushing pixels—it’s framing the conversation so we’re getting the right feedback at the right time.</p><h3><a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design/how-stack-overflow-redesigned-our-top-navigation-f77b7f968bff#.alod0lr6m">“How Stack Overflow Redesigned the Top Navigation”</a></h3><p>by <a href="https://medium.com/@kjbeavers"><em>Kurtis Beavers</em></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design/how-stack-overflow-redesigned-our-top-navigation-f77b7f968bff">How Stack Overflow Redesigned our Top Navigation</a></p><p>The new site navigation is the first major update to Stack Overflow in 4 years. And the internal and external reception to this update dominated our team’s discussion this week. To kick off this week’s links, Creative Director Kurtis Beavers breaks down the problems with the previous navigation, solutions we explored, and our testing and implementation details.</p><h3><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/design-for-the-feedback-you-want-1a65d58ff74f#.yqb7d3nie">“Design for the Feedback You Want”</a></h3><p>by <a href="https://medium.com/@speezyd"><em>Denise Spiessens</em></a></p><p><a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/design-for-the-feedback-you-want-1a65d58ff74f">Design for the feedback you want</a></p><blockquote>But if you’ve spent hours pushing pixels only to get feedback that the flow doesn’t make sense, <strong>not only was that time wasted, but you might be more reluctant to change your design after all of the time you invested. (Emphasis ours)</strong></blockquote><p>We completely agree with Denise’s article here. Sharing journey maps, creating wireframes, critiquing designs, doing code reviews—the level of feedback needed (and desired) with each step changes. You want to make sure you’re building the right thing early, and sweating the details later.</p><h3><a href="https://vimeo.com/162935382">“Proper Etiquette for the Advancement of Design”</a></h3><p>by <a href="https://medium.com/@danielmall"><em>Dan Mall</em></a><em>, </em>presented at SmashingConf SF 2016</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F162935382&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F162935382&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F565794593_1280.jpg&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo" width="1920" height="1080" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/6cd9fa147532c36998818ff52ad376d4/href">https://medium.com/media/6cd9fa147532c36998818ff52ad376d4/href</a></iframe><p>There are so many great pieces of advice in Dan’s talk. Dan practically walks through not only the reasons why designer should care about “setting the table” for design, but <em>how</em> to do it successfully.</p><h3><a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/storymapping/">“The User’s Journey: Storymapping Products That People Love”</a></h3><p>by <a href="https://medium.com/@dlichaw"><em>Donna Lichaw</em></a>, Rosenfield Media</p><p><a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/storymapping/">The User&#39;s Journey - Rosenfeld Media</a></p><blockquote>I’ve seen what happens when people feel good about what they can do with your product. They love your product. And your brand. They recommend it to others. They continue to use it over time…as long as you keep making them feel awesome. They even forgive mistakes and quirks when your product doesn’t work as expected, or your brand doesn’t behave as they’d like. People don’t care about your product or brand. They care about themselves. That’s something that you can and should embrace when you build products.</blockquote><p>At the core of great products and brands are great stories. So argues Donna Lichaw in her book, <em>The User’s Journey: Storymapping Products That People Love</em>. In this short, insightful read, Donna explains why you should consider stories, how they’re structured, and the ways you can apply them to large, medium, or small ways within a product.</p><h3><a href="https://medium.com/dropbox-design/simple-products-for-many-users-3c82519c523d#.326roh9l5">“Simple products for (many) users”</a></h3><p>by <a href="https://medium.com/@anishajain"><em>Anisha Jain</em></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/dropbox-design/simple-products-for-many-users-3c82519c523d">Simple products for (many) users</a></p><blockquote>A clear purpose enables us to create a North Star that the whole team can rally around, keep any V1 product simple, and communicate a product’s purpose through its design. It also makes it easier to say no to features that don’t matter and identify ones that do for the future.</blockquote><p>If you’ve worked on a project long enough, you find you have seemingly competing user expectations at times. Anisha outlines a number of ways you can break down these seemingly impassable chokepoints to deliver great product experiences.</p><p><em>Enjoy reading this?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YMXOXKuJVeNSpRSibXPLkA.png" /></figure><p>You may have noticed Stack Overflow sporting a new look lately.</p><p>We launched this update as part of a series of changes supporting our core mission: Make developers’ lives better. In the past year, we fully integrated our by-developers, for-developers <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs">Jobs</a> product. We added a whole new content type — <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/07/introducing-stack-overflow-documentation-beta/">Documentation</a> — to help you find even more solutions to your programming questions. And we added <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/10/bye-bye-bullets-the-stack-overflow-developer-story-is-the-new-technical-resume/">Developer Story</a> to help developers ditch the outdated resume format.</p><p>During this time, we also evolved our product development process to include more user research, allowing us to validate ideas earlier and surface more users’ voices. There’s a ton you can learn by watching people try to use a feature — things that don’t get uncovered when directly soliciting feedback. As both product and process expanded, it quickly became apparent that Stack Overflow had outgrown some of our previous design decisions.</p><h3>A Common Theme</h3><p>A pattern surfaced when talking to users: even with the addition of Jobs and Documentation to the navigation, many developers weren’t aware of the change. Digging deeper, we discovered that many weren’t really seeing the top bar at all — a “mental block” so effective that most users also couldn’t identify what the icons meant.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yr0UBOO8rh5WeBZtEorLgA.png" /></figure><p>Here’s what a few of you said:</p><blockquote><em>“When I come here I’m on a mission; I don’t care about the rest.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“You’re only there for 1 reason: to find the answer to your question.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“From my point of view, nothing above the question title exists.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“I scroll down and read the question.”</em></blockquote><p>The data validated our hypothesis — of the average 9.3 million daily visits to Stack Overflow, we get fewer than 88,000 clicks to the navigation or top bar (this includes inbox, rep, profile, and search.) If you divided each individual click per visit, that’s fewer than 1% of visits navigating anywhere (and far fewer if you counted multiple clicks per visit). Our navigation is not being used by 99% of our users.</p><p>The common use case for millions of daily visitors is “come from Google, scroll to middle of the page to a find an answer (without seeing the nav and sometimes evening ignore the question itself), and leave. This workflow makes sense — and we love helping the world’s developers gain programming knowledge quickly — but this also means many visitors don’t benefit from everything that Stack Overflow has to offer. If they’re not aware, then we’re less effective in helping more developers share their knowledge by finding questions to answer, advance their career search, utilize Documentation, or become contributing members of our community.</p><p>We hypothesized that a lack of engagement with the nav was due to a combination of browsing habits, visual hierarchy, and the right-hand position of the layout. Based on research about <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/">F-shaped reading patterns</a> and how readers’ eyes commonly move down the page, it made sense that our navigation was sub-optimal for most people.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pw66NGDWvZTL3rYbZph-Xw.png" /></figure><p>We also hypothesized that the focal point of the page (the logo) caused many users to skip over the small top bar. Plus the nav and top bar quickly scroll out of view when moving down the page.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*i0SwWai0e9edYjXUHdW0Uw.png" /></figure><p>The product design team then did a <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint">design sprint</a>. Each designer created their own design of the top nav and then converged to critique and identify the strongest ideas.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nsBtYLq-O39wMehLxiFNIQ.png" /></figure><p>The team then combined the best parts of their ideas into one design. The main thinking generated from the sprint:</p><ul><li>Remove clutter and group similar information in a way that’s more quickly parsable</li><li>Stick the navigation to the top of the page so that users who are scrolling quickly to answers or arriving from answer or comment links still have access to search or navigate the site</li><li>Use navigation design patterns more commonly found in contemporary web apps</li><li>Design the navigation as shorthand for the Stack Overflow brand</li></ul><blockquote>“I’m not even sure if the black bar is new.”</blockquote><blockquote>“I logically filter out the stuff that I know I’m not looking for.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Nav looks like tags — they might filter, but they don’t look like navigation. Makes you question what it is so I don’t click it and instead go back to Google that I’m familiar with.”</blockquote><blockquote>“I’m signed in and I still don’t know what those (inbox, achievements) mean.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Jumbled stuff at the top that you have to read and decipher.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Black bar is kinda… doesn’t look like it belongs, all else is white, grey, orange.”</blockquote><p>And the <strong>new version</strong>:</p><blockquote><em>“On the current nav I didn’t know what the inbox / rep icons were, on the new one I know what every button will do.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“I know I can search, I know I can go to Jobs.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Much more modern, this one.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“I like the old black bar, but I like that I know what I’m getting myself into on the new one.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“A lot less noise, more signal.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“Cleaner, more organized. Instead of jumbled stuff at top you have to read and decipher you can go to this.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“More standardized position that you’re used to on other sites.”</em></blockquote><h3>Project Definition</h3><p>At this point there was enough info to make the top navigation redesign an actual project. The nav is an area of the site that touches so many different use cases, user types, and metrics; it was important to tightly scope the project and clearly define the goals in advance in order to ship quickly. To mitigate scope creep, feature parity to the current navigation was the defined scope (with a few exceptions).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E06QK1TsUdfTe45dE9oL3Q.png" /><figcaption>(Remember Windows’ Hot Dog theme?)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Primary goals</strong></p><ul><li>Present all the tools we provide for developers in a way that’s consistent with them actually discovering them</li><li>Increase traffic to Jobs and Documentation</li><li>More intuitive, updated visual design</li><li>Increase the number of users who sign up and gain access to more site features</li></ul><p><strong>Secondary goals</strong></p><ul><li>Increase in notifications acknowledged</li><li>Increase or no decline in searches</li><li>No decline in questions asked</li><li>And a handful of other important and boring metrics that we simply didn’t want to screw up</li></ul><p>The progressive rollout plan to measure success had the following objectives:</p><ul><li><strong>Usability tests</strong> on clickable prototype with 6 additional users to catch any major UX and functionality issues and gather qualitative insights about the new design</li><li><strong>A/B test with 5% of anonymous users</strong> to measure usage data</li><li><strong>A/B test with 10% of registered users</strong> with less than 500 reputation to measure usage data</li><li><strong>Opt-in for all Stack Overflow employees</strong></li><li><strong>Opt-in for all users</strong> for Meta feedback and for debugging</li></ul><p>Our findings from each…</p><h3>Usability Tests</h3><p>These tests were conducted in 1–1 recorded hangouts with 6 users who ranged from having low to high reputation.</p><p>While a few participants struggled with identifying two of the icons (which were updated mid-testing), all participants successfully completed all tasks, and all participants preferred the new design over the current.</p><blockquote>“Looks really, really good. By far I like the new one — in the current one, you don’t notice the navigation at all, only the top bar. The (sub) tabs catch my eye before the current navigation.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In the old, it is weird to me that the two bars exist separately. This one feels more natural.”</blockquote><blockquote>“The new one is cleaner. Less wasted space. Things are more compact on the new one and account info is better grouped. Tabs across the top is preferable because a lot of sites have a similar flow. …much prefer the new one.”</blockquote><h3>A/B Test with 5% of Anonymous Visitors</h3><p>This test ran from 2016–12–01 to 2017–01–19 for about 2 million users in each A/B group. Anonymous visitors account for about 97% of all page views but only 61% of the current navigation clicks.</p><ul><li>Signups increased by 7%</li><li>Clicks to Questions increased by 163%</li><li>Clicks to Jobs increased by 160%</li><li>Clicks to Documentation increased by 229%</li><li>Clicks to Tags increased by 113%</li><li>Clicks to Users increased by 178%</li><li>Clicks to Ask Question increased by 33%</li><li>Searches decreased by 13%*</li></ul><p>*Adjustments to the design between the anonymous test and the registered user test were made that resolved this issue and actually improved the number of searches in the next test.</p><p>While some dropoff often happens after launch due to novelty effect, these increases were large enough to make us think that a good portion of the increases would be sustained after launch. Regardless, we’ll continue to measure and monitor the performance of the new top nav.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4YICAnl8xS5_0iRrVvVNpg.png" /><figcaption>Our handmade tracker for A/B testing funnels.</figcaption></figure><h3>A/B Test with 10% of Registered Users with Less than 500 Rep</h3><p>This test ran from 2017–01–18 to 2017–01–30 for about 100k users in each A/B group . Registered user account for about 3% of all page views but about 44% of the current top navigation clicks.</p><ul><li>Inboxes shown increased by 45%</li><li>Achievements shown increased by 11%</li><li>Clicks to Questions increased by 51%</li><li>Clicks to Jobs increased by 99%</li><li>Clicks to Documentation increased by 113%</li><li>Clicks to Tags increased by 32%</li><li>Clicks to Users increased by 82%</li><li>Clicks to Ask Question remained the same</li><li>Searches increased by 8%</li></ul><h3>Opt-in for Stack Overflow Employees</h3><p>This phase began Tuesday, February 1. About 100 Stack Overflow employees opted in to test the new top nav.</p><h3>Opt-in for All Users</h3><p>This phase began 2017–02–07 to 2017–02–14. Around 1600 users opted in.</p><p>Feedback from the Meta community has been extremely helpful. Thank you to everyone who participated! A number of bugs were fixed during this period, some feature requests were implemented and others considered or planned.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>There’s a running list of ideas we’d like to try in the near future. We plan on iterating upon the design and functionality of our new top nav in a series of A/B tests. There are also early-phase explorations into how this might roll out to international and other Stack Exchange community sites.</p><p>The design team is working on <a href="https://medium.com/stack-overflow-design/building-a-design-system-21647dc1ae74#.qnxxi7mcl">a cohesive design language</a> in order to create consistent experiences across all our product areas. Some of these changes have already rolled out, and more are coming in the near future. Special thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/ludwiczakpawel">Paweł Ludwiczak</a>’s and <a href="https://twitter.com/OdedCoster">Oded Coster</a>’s hard work designing and implementing the new top navigation.</p><p>As always, we appreciate your feedback.

Here are the five most interesting things we shared with each other.</p><h3><a href="https://library.gv.com/change-aversion-why-users-hate-what-you-launched-and-what-to-do-about-it-2fb94ce65766#.fq6tv0ucq">“Change aversion: why users hate what you launched (and what to do about it)”</a> by Aaron Sedley</h3><p><a href="https://library.gv.com/change-aversion-why-users-hate-what-you-launched-and-what-to-do-about-it-2fb94ce65766">Change aversion: why users hate what you launched (and what to do about it)</a></p><blockquote>By sampling a small percentage of users continuously, we can see attitudinal shifts that signal how much pain users are experiencing as they adjust to the changes we’ve launched.</blockquote><p>Posted almost 4 years ago, this article by <strong>Aaron Sedley</strong> is still insightful today. As product designers, we’re always changing things–trying to make things better. Aaron lays a number of practical ways your team can help turn a potentially painful experience for your users into a delightful one.</p><h3><a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/space-in-design-systems-188bcbae0d62#.bm8i7eq6h">“Space in Design Systems”</a> by Nathan Curtis</h3><p><a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/space-in-design-systems-188bcbae0d62">Space in Design Systems</a></p><blockquote>Don’t give up on systematic clarity because of exceptions. Try to solve them. If you can overcome such nuances, even with a bit of CSS trickery, you can persist a simpler concept everyone can stick to.</blockquote><p>We’re in the throes of finalizing our type and spacing systems right now for the Stack Overflow Design System. Nathan’s article was a timely one for us. Nathan not only makes strong arguments for a strong spacing system, but then breaks down the various ways to approach creating that system.</p><h3><a href="https://medium.com/email-design/why-dont-email-clients-use-modern-rendering-engines-1971a0e0fda4#.lvk4yhvhc">“Why don’t email clients use modern rendering engines?”</a> by Ted Goas</h3><p><a href="https://medium.com/email-design/why-dont-email-clients-use-modern-rendering-engines-1971a0e0fda4">Why don’t email clients use modern rendering engines?</a></p><blockquote>But remember: the primary job of an email client is to render emails, not web pages. Mimicking “modern browser engines” needn’t be a requirement and should be considered more like a nice-to-have.</blockquote><p><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> Ted is a product designer at Stack Overflow. That said, we still felt this was a great article about why email clients and browsers render HTML differently.</p><h3><a href="https://bitsofco.de/css-grid-terminology/">“CSS Grid Layout Terminology, Explained”</a> by Ire Aderinokun</h3><blockquote>CSS Grid Layout introduces a lot of new concepts; there are 17 new properties to learn, and many more new terms to understand.
