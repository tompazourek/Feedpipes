Not only does this mark its first stint in Raid Battles since this past March, you'll have your first chance to catch a <strong>Shiny Rayquaza</strong>. If you'd like to add one to your collection before it leaves the game again, here are some tips on how to catch Rayquaza.</p><h3>How To Catch Rayquaza</h3><p>For the next several weeks, Rayquaza will appear as a boss in five-star Raid Battles. If you find a nearby Rayquaza Raid, you'll need to head to the Gym where the Raid is taking place and challenge it. You'll need to have a Raid Pass in order to participate in the Raid, but you can receive one for free when you spin the Photo Disc at a Gym.</p><p>To earn an opportunity to capture Rayquaza, you'll first need to battle it. Rayquaza and other Legendary Pokemon are quite powerful, so you'll need to team up with other players in-person if you hope to defeat it. Rayquaza is a dual Dragon/Flying Pokemon, which means it has a 4x weakness to Ice-type Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Weavile, and Glaceon--they'll be your best bet. Fairy, Rock, and other Dragon Pokemon will also be effective against it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/3565053-4591460876-shiny.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3565053" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/3565053-4591460876-shiny.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1578/15787979/3565053-4591460876-shiny.jpg" srcset="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1578/15787979/3565053-4591460876-shiny.jpg 1024w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1578/15787979/3565053-4591460876-shiny.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-width="1024"></a></figure><p> </p><p>If you manage to defeat Rayquaza, you'll receive a handful of Premier Balls among other rewards; you'll need to use these Premier Balls to capture it. Study Rayquaza's movement pattern before your throws to ensure you have the best chance of snagging it. Feeding it a Golden Razz Berry will also make it a little easier to capture.</p><h3>How To Find Shiny Rayquaza</h3><p>Shiny Pokemon are fairly rare in Pokemon Go, so there's no sure-fire way to ensure you find a Shiny Rayquaza. That means you'll need to participate in as many Rayquaza Raids as possible if you're hoping to add a Shiny one to your collection. Fortunately, you'll know for sure if you've encountered one; if the Pokemon has black scales instead of green ones, then you've found yourself a Shiny. Follow the steps outlined above to add it to your collection and make other trainers envious.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-guide-how-to-catch-purify-team-rockets-/1100-6468641/">Pokemon Go Guide: How To Catch And Purify Team Rocket's Shadow Pokemon</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-community-day-august-2019-start-times-s/1100-6468778/">Pokemon Go August 2019 Community Day: Start Times, Shiny Ralts, Event Move, And More</a></li></ul><h3>How Long Will Rayquaza Be Available?</h3><p>Each Legendary in Pokemon Go typically hangs around for about a month, and that holds true for Rayquaza. The Sky High Pokemon will appear in Raids from July 31 to 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET / 9 PM BST on September 2, when it will be replaced by a different Legendary, so you have until then to capture as many as you can.</p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1100-6468850</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 14:00:00 -0700</pubDate><media:content url="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/1578/15787979/3565053-4591460876-shiny.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><dc:creator></dc:creator><category></category></item>

<item><title>New My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising Movie Trailer Introduces The Villainous Nine</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-my-hero-academia-heroes-rising-movie-trailer-i/1100-6468853/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A new trailer for My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising has been released. Though most of the trailer reuses scenes from MHA: Season 3, there are some new clips. The trailer can be watched in the tweet embedded below.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer begins with our first look at Nine, the villain of the movie. We know almost nothing about Nine--even his abilities are still unknown--but he seems to be connected to All for One, one of the biggest bads in MHA, as he dresses just like All Might's archenemy, even adopting similar headgear. The end of the trailer sees a badly injured Midoriya and Bakugo once again temporarily putting aside their differences and teaming-up, presumably to take on Nine.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/heroaca_movie/status/1156731114460872704"><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">ヒロアカ映画特報が来た!<br />12/20(金)全国ロードショー<br />『僕のヒーローアカデミア THE MOVIE ヒーローズ:ライジング』<br />特報ムービー解禁!! <a href="https://t.co/Zag30vWwG9">https://t.co/Zag30vWwG9</a> <a href="https://t.co/Dud81V0oSe">https://t.co/Dud81V0oSe</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%92%E3%83%AD%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#ヒロアカ</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/heroaca_a?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#heroaca_a</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%92%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#ヒーローズライジング</a> <a href="https://t.co/K6kC4nh4vz">pic.twitter.com/K6kC4nh4vz</a></p>  — 『僕のヒーローアカデミア THE MOVIE』公式 (@heroaca_movie) <a href="https://twitter.com/heroaca_movie/status/1156731114460872704?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">August 1, 2019</a></blockquote><text></text></div><p dir="ltr">Heroes Rising is the second MHA movie, following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-hero-academia-two-heroes-review-does-the-my-her/1100-6462039/">Two Heroes</a>, and is being advertised as the final chapter of the superhero story, as it incorporates elements from how MHA's creator originally wanted the manga to end. Whether Heroes Rising remains MHA's finale remains to be seen, though. The movie will be released in Japan on December 20 with an international release presumably scheduled for 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">In My Hero Academia, Midoriya is one of the few powerless humans born in a world where superpowers are the norm. Wanting to be a hero, despite his lack of superpowers, Midoriya strives to get into the high school where All Might, his idol and the number one hero in the world, attended. After being impressed by Midoriya's heroic potential, All Might lets the young boy in on a secret: his super strength and speed actually come from a power that can be passed from one person to the next. Midoriya is chosen as All Might's successor, but his sudden strength irks Bakugo--a boy born with the ability to sweat and detonate nitroglycerin in his palms--who's always strived to be the world's next number one hero and now, for the first time, must acknowledge that the peer he's been bullying for years might actually be stronger than him.</p><p dir="ltr">Two Heroes acts as a bridge between Season 2 and Season 3 of the MHA anime series. The movie sees All Might taking Midoriya to the US to see an old friend of his, David Shield, who's an inventor that created All Might's original hero suits. While visiting, Midoriya befriends David's daughter, Melissa, who's also exceptionally intelligent and seeks to help others by building support devices for heroes. Midoriya's vacation is cut short, however, when a metal-controlling villain attacks and captures All Might, forcing the young aspiring hero to work together with Melissa and other members of his high school class in order to save the day. Though originally a one-off character, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-my-hero-academia-story-is-being-released-i/1100-6468701/">Melissa reunites with Midoriya in My Hero Academia: Team Up Mission</a>, a brand-new manga that acts as a bridge between Seasons 3 and 4 of the anime.</p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1100-6468853</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 13:10:00 -0700</pubDate><media:content url="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/1587/15875866/3566534-mha-heroes-1181267-1280x0.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><dc:creator></dc:creator><category></category></item>
<item><title>Fortnite Stop Sign Locations Guide (Season 10)</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-stop-sign-locations-guide-season-10/1100-6468842/</link><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-season-10-patch-notes-release-date-downti/1100-6468661/">Season X</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> has officially arrived, and a lot has changed in Epic's popular battle royale game. Not only are there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-season-10-map-changes-comet-rift-zones-sk/1100-6468827/">new areas of the map</a> to explore, there's also a new Battle Pass to purchase, which gives holders access to an assortment of new challenges to complete and cosmetic rewards to unlock.</p><p>This time around, however, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-season-10-changes-how-challenges-work-and/1100-6468825/">challenges work a little differently than in past seasons</a>. Previously, Epic offered new missions to complete on a weekly basis, some of which were available to everyone, even if they didn't own a Battle Pass. Season X does away with these free missions. Now, most of the challenges are gated behind the pass, so you'll need to pick one up if you're hoping to get the most out of the new season.</p><p>The challenges are also no longer doled out weekly; rather, they're now grouped into different themed sets. Three challenges are available from the outset, with additional ones unlocking as you complete them. The first themed set is called Road Trip, and it features a couple of tasks that may give you some trouble if you're not too familiar with the island, such as one that asks you to <strong>destroy stop signs with the Catalyst outfit</strong>. If you don't know where those are, we've put together this guide to point you in the right direction.</p><h3>Where Are The Stop Sign Locations?</h3><p>The stop signs that you need to destroy are scattered all around the island. You need to vandalize a total of 10 in order to complete this challenge. Fortunately, you don't need to destroy all 10 within a single match, so you can jump into a game, visit an area where a few of the signs are bunched together, then get eliminated and repeat the process until you've completed the challenge.</p><p>The most stop signs can be found in <strong>Pleasant Park</strong>, which is home to 10 of them, so you can potentially clear this challenge in one go if you land there--although it will surely be a hotbed, as other players will be looking to complete this challenge as well. If you'd prefer to avoid the crowd, you can find three stop signs scattered around <strong>Salty Springs</strong>, and another two by <strong>Mega Mall</strong>. We've also found at least two stop signs around <strong>Paradise Palms</strong>, so you have plenty of options to choose from. You can see some locations in the tweet below.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/LydiaDeneez/status/1156929100331790336"><blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Stop sign locations ❤🛑 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#Fortnite</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteSeason10?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#FortniteSeason10</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GamerGirl?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#GamerGirl</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href="https://t.co/DyG8e8e4Zg">pic.twitter.com/DyG8e8e4Zg</a></p>  — Lydia Deneez (@LydiaDeneez) <a href="https://twitter.com/LydiaDeneez/status/1156929100331790336?ref_src=twsrc^tfw">August 1, 2019</a></blockquote><text></text></div><p> </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-where-to-visit-stone-head-statue-durr-bur/1100-6468831/">Fortnite: Where To Visit Stone Head Statue, Durr Burger Head, And A Dinosaur (Season 10) </a></li></ul><h3>How To Complete The Challenge</h3><p>As the challenge name states, it isn't enough to simply destroy the stop signs; you need to be doing so while wearing the Catalyst skin, which is unlocked at the first tier of the Season X Battle Pass. Equip the skin, then located some signs and destroy them using either your Harvesting Tool or any weapons you're able to pick up during the round. Once you finally manage to break all 10 stop signs, you'll complete the challenge and earn 10 Battle Stars.</p><p>Season X has only just begun, and much has changed in the game.

<item><title>Dev Has A Great Explanation For Why It&#039;s Going Epic Exclusive On PC</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-has-a-great-explanation-for-why-its-going-epic/1100-6468851/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Cute life-sim adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/ooblets/">Ooblets</a> did the thing that some people aren't fond of: sign an Epic exclusive deal. Now, Ooblets will launch exclusively for the Epic Games Stores on PC, while the Xbox One release remains unaffected. Indie developer Glumberland has some words on the matter, explaining the choice in a surprisingly frank message to fans.</p><p>In <a href="https://ooblets.com/2019/07/we-did-the-thing/">a blog post</a>, Glumberland stated that signing with Epic was a "big decision" the studio didn't take lightly. "[Epic] offered us a minimum guarantee on sales that would match what we'd be wanting to earn if we were just selling Ooblets across all the stores," Glumberland wrote. "That takes a huge burden of uncertainty off of us because now we know that no matter what, the game won't fail."</p><p>The financial security, according to Glumberland, gives the studio peace of mind, allowing the small team to "focus on making the game without worrying about keeping the lights on [and] afford more help and resources to start ramping up production and doing some cooler things."</p><p>Glumberland also responds to common complaints leveled against the Epic Games Store, writing, "Venting anger is cathartic and natural, but let's have just a little perspective about what we decide to get angry about." The developer suggests, instead of getting riled up over "low-stakes video game stuff," gamers should "look at the things going on and ask if there might be anything just a tad more worthwhile to be upset about." Suggestions include climate change, human rights abuses, the new Twitter desktop UI, and the final Game of Thrones season--though Glumberland says the last two are jokes.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://ooblets.com/2019/07/we-did-the-thing/">the full blog post</a> for tons of laughs and further insight behind the decision.</p><p>The indie studio did say the Epic investment "might delay" the game's initial launch, though no release date has been confirmed. Increased resources will speed up development time, but Glumberland confirmed that "it takes some time to ramp things up." Ultimately, the lack of financial pressure won't force the team to push out an incomplete product. Ooblets will arrive on other PC distributors after "a pretty long while."</p><p> </p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">1100-6468851</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 12:13:00 -0700</pubDate><media:content url="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_medium/1578/15789366/3566522-west2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="480" height="270" /><dc:creator></dc:creator><category></category></item>
<item><title>Modern Warfare Dev Downplays White Phosphorus Controversy, Says Multiplayer Is About The Fun</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-dev-downplays-white-phosphorus-cont/1100-6468852/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Infinity Ward released a heap of new details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a>'s multiplayer mode this week, both on a livestream and to journalists at a hands-on press event in Los Angeles. Those details included some of the game's new Killstreak rewards, which struck up controversy in the days before the announcement when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killstreaks-return-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-/1100-6468754/">Infinity Ward revealed that white phosphorus is one of the weapons</a> players will have access to in multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">In the real world, white phosphorus is a chemical weapon that has horrific power. The chemical ignites when it interacts with oxygen, creating a thick white smokescreen that can obscure troop movements and disorient soldiers on the battlefield. But white phosphorus also burns extremely hot, making the chemical very dangerous. It can melt skin and burn through muscle and even bone; it also is capable of reigniting days or weeks after its use.</p><p dir="ltr">Infinity Ward saw criticism for choosing to allow players to use white phosphorus against each other in the game. The inclusion of the weapon also seems at odds with Infinity Ward's stated goals for its single-player campaign. The studio has said it means for Modern Warfare's narrative to be gritty and realistic, exploring morality and gray areas soldiers have to navigate when balancing completing their missions and doing the right thing.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-saw-white-phosphorus-in-action-in-call-of-duty-/1100-6468833/">We Saw White Phosphorus In Action In Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare -- Here's What Happened</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-modern-warfare-multiplayer-hands-on-rebuilding/1100-6468817/">Modern Warfare Multiplayer Hands-On: Rebuilding Call Of Duty From The Guns Up</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-reveal-modern-warfare-multiplayer-new/1100-6468832/">Call Of Duty Reveal: Modern Warfare Multiplayer News Recap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfares-night-multiplayer-map/1100-6468845/">Modern Warfare's Night Multiplayer Maps Are Its Coolest New Feature</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-multiplayer-supports-m/1100-6468819/">Modern Warfare Multiplayer Supports Up To 100 Players</a></li></ul><p>Call of Duty games of the past have included weapons in multiplayer that are horrific in the real world, including flame throwers, napalm, and even nuclear weapons. Art director Joel Emslie pointed out during an interview with GameSpot that Modern Warfare's multiplayer trailer ended with a nuclear detonation. Nuclear bombs have been Killstreak rewards in past Call of Duty games.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ultimately, I think it's a realistic game," Emslie said. "It's mature-rated and, you know, you saw a nuclear bomb go off at the end of the trailer."</p><p dir="ltr">As far as the disconnect between what the narrative is trying to say about war and the way multiplayer portrays it, Emslie said the two modes are trying to accomplish different things.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think that, in the end, the narrative is telling a story, a serious story, and it does things in a way, to make things--it's trying to get a dramatic reaction out of the player, and making you feel things," Emslie said.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want people to be thoughtful about what they're playing," audio director Stephen Miller added.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the narrative experience, you're using this landscape and this universe to make people care about these characters," Emslie continued. "And then when you're in the multiplayer space, you're trying to get them, using the same things in the same universe, to care more about the fun that they're having. It's almost like a mental chess game, where you're solving puzzles with mechanics and doing these things. And the characters that are in there, it's more about representing you in this play-space.</p><p dir="ltr">"...It's almost like having two different actors in the same film," he said. "You might have a really dramatic, deep, disturbed character with a horrible past and all this trauma. And then over here, you've got another character that's devil may care, whatever. But I look at it that way. I almost look at the game as, it's three very different characters and actors in the same film, in the same play."</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/13/532809626/u-s-led-coalition-has-used-white-phosphorous-in-fight-for-mosul-general-says">NPR reports</a>, the US military has used white phosphorus in Iraq during the war there and in fighting the Islamic State. The substance isn't banned under the <a href="https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention">Chemical Weapons Convention</a>, as long as it's used to create smokescreens and not as a weapon itself. Human rights organizations have pushed the US and others to stop using the chemical weapon, however, because of the risk to civilians, especially in urban settings.</p><p dir="ltr">We saw white phosphorus in use in Modern Warfare <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-multiplayer-hands-on-rebuilding-cal/1100-6468817/">during our hands-on session</a>. It blankets the battlefield in white smoke, which does a small amount of damage to enemy players, renders their screens in black-and-white, and disorients them as they go cough through it. We didn't encounter any canisters, which apparently will "burn any that wander too close," according to Infinity Ward's description of the Killstreak reward.

And fortunately for those planning to pick it up on day one, it seems Dragon Quest XI S is being included as part of Amazon and Walmart's ongoing pattern of discounting games to $49.94 before they've even released. The fact that it's labeled as the number one best-selling Switch game on Amazon right now may have something to do with such an early price drop. In any case, you can grab Dragon Quest XI S at that price right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1591/15918215/3566427-dragon%20quest%20xi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3566427" data-ratio="1.0341671751068" data-width="1639" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1639px"><a href="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1591/15918215/3566427-dragon%20quest%20xi.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1591/15918215/3566427-dragon%20quest%20xi.jpg" srcset="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1591/15918215/3566427-dragon%20quest%20xi.jpg 1639w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1591/15918215/3566427-dragon%20quest%20xi.jpg 1237w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1591/15918215/3566427-dragon%20quest%20xi.jpg 928w" sizes="(max-width: 1237px) 100vw, 1237px" data-width="1237"></a></figure><h3><strong>Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition</strong></h3><p><strong>$49.94 (<del>$60</del>)</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Quest-XI-Elusive-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B07NQGDXRY?tag=gamespotdeals-20">See it at Amazon</a> <a href="http://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=VZfI20jEa0c&amp;mid=2149&amp;murl=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Dragon-Quest-XI-S-Echoes-of-an-Elusive-Age-Definitive-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-045496594381/956081585">See it at Walmart</a></p><p>The good thing about pre-ordering games at Amazon is that you're guaranteed the lowest price after you place your order, even if the price drops again between now and September 27.

But if (and when) the price goes back up to $60, you won't pay any more than the sale price you committed to. Walmart doesn't offer that price guarantee, but you'll still get the game on release day with either retailer.</p><p>Dragon Quest XI's Definitive edition includes all the content from the original game as well as additional character-specific stories, orchestral field and battle music, the ability to toggle between HD and retro 16-bit visuals, side quests that let you travel into past Dragon Quest worlds, both Japanese and English voice tracks, and more.</p><p>Of course, you can get in on some Dragon Quest action already with the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-smash-bros-ultimates-hero-dlc-releasing-toda/1100-6468755/"> release of Super Smash Bros.

Not too much is known about the game, though Respawn has been adamant that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-premium-titanfall-experience-isnt-a-vr-game/1100-6464846/">it is not the "premium" Titanfall experience</a> that it's also been working on.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/oc6-news-registration-now-open-plus-first-wave-of-sessions-announced/">blog post</a>, the Oculus team announced Respawn's new VR game would be revealed at this year's Oculus Connect, which is scheduled for September 25-26. The game is described as a "triple-A first-person combat title made in partnership with Oculus Studios." A hands-on demo will be available at Oculus Connect.</p><p dir="ltr">Respawn has a proven track record with first-person action games, being the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/titanfall/">Titanfall</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/titanfall-2/">Titanfall 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a>. However, this unannounced title is the studio's first foray into VR. Respawn hasn't said whether this VR game is a spin-off of the Titanfall franchise, like Apex Legends, or a brand-new story for the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside this VR game, Respawn is currently creating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-apex-legends-event-will-deliver-one-of-the-mos/1100-6468808/">a limited-time event for Apex Legends: Season 2</a>, beginning work on Apex Legends: Season 3, and finishing up on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>--all of which are scheduled for this year. Fallen Order stands to be the developer's biggest project of the year, delivering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-orders-exploration-inspired-/1100-6467974/">Metroid Prime-inspired Star Wars experience</a> that also utilizes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-is-very-similar-to-sek/1100-6468711/">a similar combat system</a> to From Software's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Star Wars, ILMxLAB will also be at Oculus Connect 2019 to talk about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vader-immortal-is-a-new-star-wars-series-coming-to/1100-6462070/">Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/vader-immortal-episode-i/">first episode</a> of the Oculus Quest exclusive VR experience was received very well by fans and critics alike, containing fun lightsaber mechanics and a never-before-seen canonical story about Darth Vader's quest to bring Padme back to life.

Infinity Ward showed off the competitive mode to journalists ahead of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-livestream-modern-warfare-multiplayer/1100-6468832/">multiplayer reveal livestream</a>, where we got a chance to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-multiplayer-can-suppor/1100-6468819/">engage in 20-on-20 battles</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-youll-have-to-earn-your-radar-in-ca/1100-6468813/">try out new Killstreaks</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-multiplayer-rebuilding-call-of-duty/1100-6468817/">customize all our guns</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-multiplayer-rebuilding-call-of-duty/1100-6468817/">drive tanks</a>.</p><p>The coolest new addition to Call of Duty multiplayer, though, is probably Modern Warfare's take on night-vision goggles. The game supports day and night versions of several maps, and we played a match on a version of the map "Caves," blanketed in darkness. Fighting at night completely changes the feel of the map--as you move through it, you have to decide whether to use goggles for heightened visibility or to take them off in favor of natural light sources that might blow out the goggles' optics. There's also a hardcore version of the mode that removes your heads-up display information, making the darkness more intrusive and your time in the goggles even more realistic. Check out our gameplay with Modern Warfare's night-vision googles in the video above.</p><p>Using night-vision gives you the ability to see in the dark, but it also has its drawbacks. Modern Warfare takes into account the size of the goggles when you're wearing them. If you were wearing NVGs in the real world and tried to look into a gun scope, the gun would bang into the goggles. That's the case in Modern Warfare, too, so when you draw up your gun to aim down its sights while wearing NVGs, the weapon rests about halfway up, instead. It's more accurate than aiming from the hip, but not quite as useful as normal ADS. That creates a tradeoff situation you'll have to adapt to if you want to be effective in the dark. However, you can also fully customize all your weapons in Modern Warfare. Opting for smaller sights can get the optics out of the way and let you pull the rifle up to aim properly.</p><p>The goggles also significantly change how you think about engagements with other players. On NVG maps, guns come with infrared targeting lasers that are invisible to the naked eye but become fully visible in the goggles. The lasers only appear when you hit the ADS button, taking up the role your scope would otherwise occupy.</p><p>The trouble is that if you can see your laser while using night-vision, so can anyone else who's wearing goggles. Your laser then becomes something of a liability: Whenever you ADS, you're not only sighting in a target, you're also revealing your location to anyone who can see the laser. During its multiplayer press event, Infinity Ward developers discussed how real-world soldiers practice "laser discipline" to make sure their lasers aren't giving them away. You'll need to do the same thing in Modern Warfare--but the intel you get from other players who aren't as careful about their aim can help you set up ambushes and take advantage.</p><p>Of course, whenever you're using NVGs, you have to worry about being blinded by sudden flashes of light. That can push you to change up your loadout choices. Guns with big muzzle flashes can blow out your goggles somewhat (as well as those of your opponents), while flashbangs are even more hazardous to anybody too close to them. And of course, you need to be careful about any light sources around you that might disorient you.</p><p>It seems a minor change, but thanks to the attention to detail Infinity Ward has put on its night-vision tech, flipping a map from day to night significantly changes up Modern Warfare's gameplay. Suddenly, a lot of tactical decisions you don't make during the day, like where to move between light and darkness, and when to risk taking aim, dominate your decision-making. The night-vision goggles of Modern Warfare feel very authentic, and all the pros and cons they bring mean adapting to new strategies. The inclusion of night-vision bucks the multiplayer formula just enough to add exactly the kind of fresh dynamics Infinity Ward is going for with Modern Warfare.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-multiplayer-rebuilding-call-of-duty/1100-6468817/">our impressions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's multiplayer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-beta-announced-heres-a/1100-6468821/">read more about its open beta</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-multiplayer-can-suppor/1100-6468819/">how big teams can get</a>, and how the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-youll-have-to-earn-your-radar-in-ca/1100-6468813/">changing radar and Killstreaks</a>.

<item><title>Fire Emblem: Three Houses Gift Guide - The Best Gifts For Every Character</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-three-houses-gift-guide-the-best-gifts/1100-6468843/</link><description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/fire-emblem-three-houses/">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a> doesn't have much in the way of romance, cultivating friendships with students and faculty is still a major part of the game. As a new professor at Garreg Mach monastery, sometimes you just gotta buy the love (and motivation) of the people around you. If you're not sure whether your favorite character will like the gift you got them, don't worry--we've tested it out so you don't have to face the shame of, "Oh. I guess I'll take it."</p><p dir="ltr">Gift-giving is important for a number of reasons. A loved gift will sharply increase your support bond with the recipient, and if they're in your class, it will also increase their motivation gauge by 50 (out of 100). Keeping students motivated to learn means you'll be able to instruct them more, and improving bonds is a crucial part of recruiting new students and improving your joint performance on the battlefield. A basic gift will also give you a minor support boost and a smaller motivation increase, but as with most things in Three Houses, you should strive to get the most bang for your buck.</p><figure data-ref-id="1300-3566481" data-img-src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3566481-2019070910502600-0dc6ece91cf3f6f02bafc002e3ffbaad.jpg" data-size="large" data-align="center" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1280px"><a href="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3566481-2019070910502600-0dc6ece91cf3f6f02bafc002e3ffbaad.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3566481-2019070910502600-0dc6ece91cf3f6f02bafc002e3ffbaad.jpg" srcset="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1575/15759911/3566481-2019070910502600-0dc6ece91cf3f6f02bafc002e3ffbaad.jpg 1280w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1575/15759911/3566481-2019070910502600-0dc6ece91cf3f6f02bafc002e3ffbaad.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" data-width="1280"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">To start off, literally everyone in the game likes Owl Feathers. If you're at a total loss for what to give someone (or you're just out of relevant gifts), it's a great plan B. You can find Owl Feathers around the monastery. As for flowers, you can plant flower seeds in the Greenhouse and harvest them for your gift-giving needs the next time you explore. The rest of these gifts can be purchased from various merchants, mainly the Eastern and Western Merchants in the monastery's marketplace. Note that this list is not comprehensive; we'll update with more gifts as we continue to test them out.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Black Eagles</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Edelgard (Black Eagles only):</strong> Armored Bear Stuffy, Monarch Studies Book</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hubert (Black Eagles only):</strong> Coffee Beans, Board Game</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ferdinand:</strong> Tea Leaves, Riding Boots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Caspar:</strong> Smoked Meat, Whetstone</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Linhardt:</strong> Fishing Float, Tasty Baked Treat</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dorothea:</strong> Stylish Hair Clip</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bernadetta:</strong> Armored Bear Stuffy, Pitcher Plant, Watering Can, Dapper Handkerchief, Landscape Painting</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Petra:</strong> Smoked Meat, Hunting Dagger</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Blue Lions</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dimitri (Blue Lions only):</strong> Whetstone, Training Weight</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dedue (Blue Lions only):</strong> Watering Can</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ashe:</strong> Exotic Spices, Legends of Chivalry, Violet</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sylvain:</strong> Dapper Handkerchief, Board Game</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ingrid:</strong> Legends of Chivalry, Riding Boots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Felix:</strong> Ceremonial Sword, Hunting Dagger</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Annette:</strong> Stylish Hair Clip</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mercedes:</strong> Armored Bear Stuffy, Goddess Statuette</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Golden Deer</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Claude (Golden Deer only):</strong> Riding Boots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hilda (Golden Deer only):</strong> Anemone, Armored Bear Stuffy</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Leonie:</strong> Fishing Float, Training Weight</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lysithea:</strong> Lily, Tasty Baked Treat, Armored Bear Stuffy</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ignatz:</strong> Landscape Painting, Goddess Statuette, Ancient Coin, Forget-me-nots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Raphael:</strong> Smoked Meat, Tasty Baked Treat</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lorenz:</strong> Rose, Floral Adornment</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Marianne:</strong> Armored Bear Stuffy, Floral Adornment</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Other</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hanneman:</strong> Dapper Handkerchief</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Catherine:</strong> Whetstone, Legends of Chivalry</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Shamir:</strong> Coffee Beans, Sunflower</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gilbert:</strong> Goddess Statuette, Ceremonial Sword</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Rhea:</strong> Landscape Painting, Goddess Statuette</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seteth:</strong> Fishing Float, Dapper Handkerchief</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cyril:</strong> Smoked Meat, Watering Can</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Alois:</strong> Floral Adornment, Fishing Float, Ancient Coin, Sunflower</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Manuela:</strong> Goddess Statuette</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Flayn:</strong> Forget-me-nots</li></ul><p>For more Fire Emblem: Three Houses tips, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-three-houses-student-recruitment-requi/1100-6468740/">guide to recruiting students</a>, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-three-houses-guide-to-sharing-meals-ef/1100-6468745/">best tips for sharing meals</a>, and our rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fire-emblem-three-houses-guide-gardening-tips-and-/1100-6468747/">how gardening works</a>.

However, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cross-saves-coming-to-all-platforms-incl/1100-6467375/">upcoming cross save feature</a> has been moved up and will be releasing this month.</p><p dir="ltr">"Being independent means that the future of Destiny 2 is entirely on our team," Destiny 2 director Luke Smith and general manager Mark Noseworthy wrote in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48032">blog post</a>. "It also means that we're agile enough to choose to do what's best for the game and our players, even if it's the hard choice." Previously scheduled for September 17, Destiny 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-shadowkeep-changes-the-moon-heres-how/1100-6468521/">Shadowkeep</a> expansion and free-to-play New Light version have been delayed to October 1. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1587/15875866/3566469-shadowkeep_keyart_1-1_date.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3566469" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 1080px"><a href="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1587/15875866/3566469-shadowkeep_keyart_1-1_date.jpg"><img alt="No Caption Provided" src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1587/15875866/3566469-shadowkeep_keyart_1-1_date.jpg" srcset="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1587/15875866/3566469-shadowkeep_keyart_1-1_date.jpg 1080w, https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1587/15875866/3566469-shadowkeep_keyart_1-1_date.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" data-width="1080"></a></figure><p dir="ltr">As a result of the delay, several other dates for Destiny 2 have changed as well.

Another Iron Banner event is being squeezed into Destiny 2's summer line-up too, beginning September 17.</p><p dir="ltr">An exact date for cross save hasn't been provided, though Smith and Noseworthy did teas it will release "well ahead" of the Shadowkeep expansion. Destiny 2 lead producer Jared Berbach <a href="https://twitter.com/darkhorse4life/status/1156975091906859009?s=21">tweeted</a> that cross save can be expected to launch this month. </p><p dir="ltr"><span>"We didn't make this decision lightly," Smith and Noseworthy wrote. "We know for some of you (us too), Destiny releases are events where you take time off of work or develop a sudden sickness that keeps you from school or work (we get it, a bunch of our team takes some time off to go on their own Destiny Jacket Quest)." The two promises that more information about what's coming to Destiny 2 in the fall will be announced next week.</span></p><p dir="ltr">The final major content drop for Destiny 2: Year 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-update-solstice-of-heroes-2019-patch-not/1100-6468770/">Solstice of Heroes 2019</a>, has just dropped.
