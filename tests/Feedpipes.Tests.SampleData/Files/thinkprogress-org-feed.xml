								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump on Thursday tweeted that he would apply 10% tariffs on  $300 billion worth of Chinese imports.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trade talks are continuing, and&#8230; during the talks the U.S. will start, on September 1st, putting a small additional Tariff of 10% on the remaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods and products coming from China into our Country. This does not include the 250 Billion Dollars already Tariffed at 25%&#8221; the president <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979443900067841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in a series of tweets.</p>
<p>But while the White House described this week&#8217;s trade talks between the U.S. and China as &#8220;constructive,&#8221; little progress was made.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the president tweeted that countries such as Iran and China, both embroiled in heated diplomatic contretemps with the U.S. (Iran, over the nuclear deal Trump violated and the sanctions he subsequently imposed, and China, over trade) are hoping he doesn&#8217;t get reelected in 2020:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">China, Iran &amp; other foreign countries are looking at the Democrat Candidates and “drooling” over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future. They would be able to rip off our beloved USA like never before. With President Trump, NO WAY!</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156933712761753600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>China still wants the United States to lift the tariffs the White House placed on $250 billion in Chinese goods, but the U.S. is not budging, insisting that China take a number of steps first &#8212; including opening its markets to U.S. business and stopping the forced transfer of technology.</p>
<p>As the deadlock has dragged on over the past year, negotiations have, at times, regressed, with each country slapping tariffs on an increasing number of categories of the other&#8217;s exports. Talks finally <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/trump-threat-tariffs-china-trade-deal-9d67cded3481/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broke down</a> entirely in May.</p>
<p>That China might be hoping to wait out Trump isn&#8217;t surprising as the Chinese government has historically taken the long view on most issues. In the meantime, however, the stalled talks and escalation of tariffs create new uncertainties for the U.S. economy as this contentious trade war persists with no end in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over time, I have a hard time seeing a protectionist U.S. grow more than an integrated U.S.,&#8221; said Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>But he doesn&#8217;t think the Chinese are stalling because they fear President Trump&#8217;s toughness at the bargaining table.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sense is that the Chinese have lost interest in a deal because they don&#8217;t trust the Trump administration any longer,&#8221; said Kennedy. And this drawn-out trade war, he said, will have a negative effect on the U.S. economy, one way or the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;How quickly that is reflected depends on where you are in the economy,&#8221; he added. Soybean farmers have already been hit, for example, whereas consumers will start paying higher prices when the latest round of tariffs are applied on Chinese goods in the fall.</p>
<p>By Kennedy&#8217;s reckoning, the prolonged trade war will adversely affect business and consumer confidence in the United States, piling onto the collateral damage that he believes has been wrought by the Trump administration&#8217;s &#8220;economic nationalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>He expects the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to see this situation as a net negative, and issue estimates in August on its impact on global economic growth.</p>
<h2>A deal won&#8217;t fix all that is broken</h2>
<p>Robert E. Scott, senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, said that the tariffs are a bad idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a fan of these tariffs&#8230; there&#8217;s no strategy behind it and it&#8217;s unlikely to lead to an improvement in our trade relations, or that it&#8217;s going to help workers or American production,&#8221; said Scott.</p>

<h3 class="related-content__title">China and US trade talks to resume, but don&#8217;t hold your breath for a deal just yet</h3>
<p class="related-content__dek">Experts tell us that negotiators are a million miles apart on key issues.</p>
</p></div>
<p>	</a>
</div>
<p>While he doesn&#8217;t think a trade war that drags along for another year and a half will be catastrophic to the U.S. economy, Thursday&#8217;s fresh round of tariffs, he said, &#8220;ups the ante,&#8221; making it unclear &#8220;how long consumers can continue to fuel economic growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that some U.S. farmers and manufacturers have already said that they are feeling the pinch, with consumers bracing for <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/sony-warns-playstation-might-get-more-expensive-if-the-trade-war-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price increases</a>.</p>
<p>But contrary to President Donald Trump&#8217;s claims, China isn&#8217;t footing the bill for his tariffs, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-says-china-is-paying-his-tariffs-but-us-companies-keep-getting-the-bill/2019/07/22/cbe5a1e4-aca3-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html?utm_term=.4782d367546d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American business owners are</a>. Some are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/29/polaris-ceo-scott-wine-supports-trump-trade-goal-but-says-tariffs-hurt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buffering consumers from drastic price hikes</a> by taking the hit themselves, or are spending money <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/annashedletsky/2019/07/02/the-7-problems-manufacturers-will-need-to-solve-to-move-their-supply-chains-out-of-china/#1dd6b3ec5a13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving their supply chains away from China</a>.</p>
<p>Farmers took a hit at the start of the trade war, but the Trump administration started <a href="https://www.farmers.gov/manage/mfp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering aid</a>, and, it seems, is now <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/25/745280710/economists-say-trump-administration-is-over-paying-farmers-for-trade-losses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over-compensating</a> on some fronts, costing taxpayers more than $26 billion in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>But, Scott said, it&#8217;s not the trade war with China that is causing most of this pain: It&#8217;s a combination of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/26/us-economic-growth-gdp-second-quarter-2019-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slowing domestic economic growth</a> (after the sugar rush of last year&#8217;s tax cut wore off), combined with a slow-down in <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/03/28/world-economic-outlook-april-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global economic growth</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;That 0.5% negative impact of tariffs does loom larger when baseline growth is so low, and tenuous,&#8221; Scott cautioned.</p>
<p>He added that there was nothing in either the tax or spending bills that was going to &#8220;rebuild the domestic economy, and generate increased demands in the future.&#8221; The president also didn&#8217;t<a href="https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-goes-back-to-pretending-to-care-about-infrastructure-66dad4fe8e0a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> increase spending on infrastructure</a> as he said he would, he added.</p>
<p>Yet President Trump&#8217;s former economic adviser Gary Cohn <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49187126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> the BBC on Thursday that the trade war has had a &#8220;dramatic impact&#8221; on the U.S. manufacturing sector. He added that with everything &#8212; including credit availability &#8212; being controlled by the state, China has a better chance of weathering this crisis.</p>

<h3 class="related-content__title">Digging in for a long fight, China isn&#8217;t about to say &#8216;uncle&#8217; in the trade war Trump started</h3>

<p>	</a>
</div>
<p>Scott points out that Cohn is basically only talking about Wall Street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall Street is very dependent on the state of the manufacturing sector in China. They are very invested in globalization and offshoring,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Despite President Trump&#8217;s tariffs, trade deficits <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-trade/u-s-trade-deficit-surges-to-five-month-high-as-imports-soar-idUSKCN1TY1PR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keep increasing, </a>and even American companies aren&#8217;t bringing manufacturing jobs back home from China. Instead, they&#8217;re moving them to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3009245/trade-war-pushing-companies-china-vietnam-experts-warn-they" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taiwan or Vietnam,</a> and China is shipping parts and components to those plants.</p>
<h2>Over-valued dollar + protectionism = trouble</h2>
<p>Is getting a deal important? Yes. Do both countries need it? Absolutely. However, it&#8217;s possible that no trade deal will solve the very real problems &#8212; the massive trade deficit and the forced transfer of technology, for instance &#8212; that the U.S. has with China.</p>
<p>China is the U.S.&#8217;s third largest trading partner, and a huge player in the global supply chain. But, said Kennedy, it is neither the savior nor the bane of the American economy.</p>
<p>President Trump&#8217;s protectionism, however, is another matter, with investors looking at this issue not strictly through a perspective of U.S.-China tension, but rather through the prism of the global economy as a whole. The president has imposed or threatened to impose tariffs on virtually every major trading partner: Canada, Mexico, the European Union, China, India, Japan, and South Korea.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of what Kennedy feels the president should be doing, which is to lift tariffs off allies, present a united front against China, and develop &#8220;new rules of the road&#8221; for international trade &#8212; all in the service of creating a more level playing field for global trade.</p>
<p>Scott, however, feels that the main culprit in hurting the American economy is the over-valued U.S. dollar &#8212; especially against the Chinese Yuan. Without rebalancing the U.S. dollar, trade deficits and manufacturing losses will continue.</p>
<p>American manufacturing and agriculture alike have been hit by the strength of the dollar, which makes prices of U.S. goods &#8212; especially farm goods, whose prices are set on the global market &#8212; uncompetitively high. Recent floods in the U.S. and decreased Chinese purchases haven&#8217;t helped matters. Nevertheless, the U.S. dollar&#8217;s appreciation (driven higher by increased U.S. borrowing) is the biggest culprit, said Scott.</p>
<p>Plus, China is happy to continue to devalue its currency &#8212; down 8.3% since February 2018 &#8212; which allows it to offset the effects of the tariffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have countered Trump&#8217;s move and he doesn&#8217;t have an answer,&#8221; said Scott, adding that they are also waiting for Trump to simply be voted out of office.</p>
<p>But what if he&#8217;s not? Kennedy said China will expect a bifurcated global economy &#8212; one centered around the U.S. and one around itself. It will continue to aggressively develop technology, build trade and investment partnerships, and make whatever moves it has at its disposal to weaken the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will see this as part of a broader strategic partnership&#8230; they would be responding, very much in parallel, to what the U.S. is doing,&#8221; said Kennedy.	</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) shared a story on Thursday about Layleen Cubilette-Polanco, an Afro-Latinx trans woman who died at Rikers Island in New York City in June, coupling it with a call for sweeping reforms to the criminal justice system. Her interest in the tragic story may signal to advocates for LGBTQ equality that she is committed to acknowledging the effects of the criminal justice system on trans people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>Warren <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1156982642996326400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted on Thursday,</a> &#8220;Let’s be clear: Layleen Cubilette-Polanco should still be alive. Solitary confinement is cruel and inhumane. We must end this practice, enforce strict standards for medical care, and provide extra layers of protection for LGBTQ+ people.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let’s be clear: Layleen Cubilette-Polanco should still be alive. Solitary confinement is cruel and inhumane. We must end this practice, enforce strict standards for medical care, and provide extra layers of protection for LGBTQ+ people.<a href="https://t.co/J9yjkCd1tF">https://t.co/J9yjkCd1tF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1156982642996326400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Cubilette-Polanco was arrested in April on misdemeanor assault charges, and bail was set at $500. A judge ordered her release on those charges, but she was still being held for low-level drug charges and prostitution charges from two years prior. She was placed in a unit for trans women, where she was involved in a fight and subsequently relocated to a restrictive housing unit, which many have referred to as solitary confinement. Her family said she could not afford to pay bail. She died at Rikers <a href="https://pix11.com/2019/07/30/cause-of-death-revealed-for-woman-who-died-in-rikers-cell-after-she-couldnt-pay-500-bail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as a result</a> of a <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">medical condition that causes seizures, according to Chief Medical Examiner the City of New York, Dr. Barbara Sampson. </span></p>
<p>Shortly after her death, 600 people <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/layleen-cubilette-polanco-trans-woman-found-dead-in-her-cell-at-rikers-new-york-community-searching-for-answers-0b5424b6d24e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gathered</a> in Foley Square in New York, chanting “Black trans lives matter!”</p>
<p>Tina Luongo, the attorney-in-charge of the Criminal Defense Practice at The Legal Aid Society, <a href="https://pix11.com/2019/07/30/cause-of-death-revealed-for-woman-who-died-in-rikers-cell-after-she-couldnt-pay-500-bail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a> a statement to media this week following the official news of Cubilette-Polanco&#8217;s cause of death. “Layleen Polanco’s death is an absolute tragedy, and her passing further underscores the dangers of solitary confinement, which isolates already medically fragile people from observation and care,&#8221; said Luongo. &#8220;We demand utmost transparency and rigor in the investigation of the correctional and medical policies and decisions surrounding her treatment and her placement in isolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawyers from David B. Shaines Law Office, who represent her family, have said that Cubilette-Polanco experienced multiple seizures at Rikers and that the Department of Corrections knew about her epilepsy. They say she should have never placed in &#8220;punitive segregation,&#8221; and that it &#8220;became her death warrant.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we also received documentary confirmation that Layleen’s epilepsy was well known to DOC, and she suffered multiple seizures on Rikers.  </p>
<p>On 5/30, a jail doctor approved her placement in punitive segregation, despite her epilepsy. </p>
<p>That became her death warrant.</p>
<p>(2/3)</p>
<p>&mdash; Shanies Law Office (@ShaniesLaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaniesLaw/status/1156340661731414017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There is some evidence that the staff have not handled conflict within the trans women&#8217;s unit well, which is perhaps the reason why she was placed in the restrictive housing unit to begin with. A 2018 New York City Board of Corrections <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfOxLbUHYyVcbcjYmTZLAKnwQRBcp2xT/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> assessing its Transgender Housing Unit determined that there is “no effective mechanism to address conflict between people in the unit.” There were many other criticisms of the unit, including poor training of staff on how to serve transgender people in the unit.</p>
<p>Cubilette-Polanco&#8217;s treatment by the criminal justice system is a case study in how it disproportionately and negatively impacts many vulnerable populations &#8212; trans women, people of color, and low-income people and their families who can&#8217;t afford bail. By tweeting about her story and potential reforms, Warren is bringing attention to those criticisms. But she is also notably filling in the gaps of some of her own proposed policies to improve the well-being of LGBTQ people.</p>
<p>In May, NewNowNext <a href="http://www.newnownext.com/elizabeth-warren-lgbtq/05/2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> on Warren&#8217;s proposals and policies designed to advance LGBTQ rights. That included reversing Donald Trump&#8217;s military trans ban, a vow to “protect civil rights for transgender people,&#8221; outlawing conversion therapy, reversing the State Department&#8217;s denial of family visas to same-sex domestic partners of diplomats, and ending discrimination against queer men who are currently barred from donating blood. She also said she supports the Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in housing, employment, education, federal programs, jury service, public accommodations, and credit and lending. Warren added that she&#8217;d implement the Refund Equality Act she co-sponsored in 2017, which would mean that same-sex couples married in states before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality could amend amend past tax returns, which would allow them to get IRS refunds.</p>
<p>Although Warren acknowledged many important barriers for LGBTQ people, one of the holes in her plan for LGBTQ equality was in the criminal justice system. Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s LGBT &amp; HIV Project, asked how she would acknowledge the struggles of trans people of color. &#8220;What about prisons, sex work?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ewarren</a> &#8211; I really really support you in many ways but your LGBTQ plan is so basic and grounded in formalistic notions of equality and is not going to save the lives of the Black and Indigenous trans people who need material and radical change. What about prisons, sex work? <a href="https://t.co/2bPPw0LtG0">https://t.co/2bPPw0LtG0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) <a href="https://twitter.com/chasestrangio/status/1130906561793200130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Although we don&#8217;t know all of the circumstances of Cubilette-Polanco&#8217;s life, her experience in the criminal justice system and protracted stay and eventual segregation within Rikers was likely compounded for many reasons. She was poor and couldn&#8217;t afford bail. She felt the effects of the criminalization of sex work. Sex workers are currently fighting for decriminalization, and one of their <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/decrim-new-york-legislation-decriminalize-sex-work-e604f16b5271/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chief arguments</a> is that it will make sex workers and those whom police profile as sex workers &#8212; who are often <a href="https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/mcleod/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trans women of color</a> &#8212; much safer. As the National Center for Transgender Equality <a href="https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/Meaningful%20Work-Full%20Report_FINAL_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> in a 2015 report on sex work:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Transgender people overall experience high levels of discrimination in every area of life, as well as high levels of poverty, unemployment, homelessness, negative interactions with police, incarceration, and violent victimization. As a result, many transgender people participate in the sex trade in order to earn income or as </span><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">an alternative to relying on homeless shelters and food banks. The criminalizing </span><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">and stigmatizing of sex work in the United States can worsen the discrimination </span><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">and marginalization that transgender people already face in society.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Warren has not fully answered Strangio&#8217;s question about policies supporting trans people of color, but her focus on Cubilette-Polanco&#8217;s story is another example of her taking steps to show her support of trans people, particularly some of the most marginalized in the trans community. In January, for instance, ThinkProgress <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/elizabeth-warren-transgender-prisoners-lgbtq-record-352c3b445bba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pressed</a> Warren on her 2012 remark that transition-related surgeries for incarcerated trans people was not a “good use of taxpayer dollars.”</p>
<p>Warren’s presidential exploratory committee said in a statement, “Senator Warren supports access to medically necessary services, including transition-related surgeries,” claimed an unnamed spokesperson for her 2020 exploratory committee. “This includes procedures taking place at the VA, in the military, or at correctional facilities.”</p>
<p>In another show of support for transgender and nonbinary Americans, Warren recently updated her Twitter bio to include her pronouns, and at the Iowa City presidential debate, staffers&#8217; nametags <a href="https://twitter.com/ChloeAngyal/status/1156563034237743105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">included</a> pronouns for their gender. During the previous presidential debate held in June, she used the word &#8220;Latinx&#8221; instead of &#8220;Latino&#8221; to be inclusive of all genders. Those may seem like small gestures, but they nevertheless show her support of transgender and nonbinary people.</p>
<p>“I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for? It’s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top … It’s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons but not for the African Americans and Latinx who are torn apart and whose lives are destroyed,&#8221; she said.	</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were plenty of things to love about the WNBA All-Star Game in Las Vegas last weekend. The skills challenge and three-point competition on Friday night was a blast. The players were treated like the superstars they are. The crowds were electric. And the game itself was a thrilling 129-126 victory for Team A&#8217;ja Wilson over Team Elena Delle Donne, that included three dunks by Brittney Griner and one of the most emotional, inspiring performances in WNBA history by Indiana Fever guard Erica Wheeler, an undrafted guard who was named the MVP of the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was amazing. Definitely one of the best that I’ve attended,&#8221; said six-time All-Star Sylvia Fowles.</p>
<p>But the most refreshing part of the weekend? The host city really pulled out all the stops. Walking around Vegas, there were signs for the All-Star Game everywhere, from billboards to casino walls to public transportation. And none of them included inspirational slogans, the color pink, or rhetoric about supporting women. They weren&#8217;t focused on sex appeal, either. The ads just showcased the faces of the most elite women&#8217;s basketball players in the world, along with the name, date, and time of the event. Simple, and effective.</p>
<p>Nneka Ogwumike, an All-Star forward with the Los Angeles Aces and the president of the WNBA Players Association, was impressed with the visibility of the advertisements and the focus on basketball above all else. &#8220;It&#8217;s the [Las Vegas] Aces, it&#8217;s the WNBA All-Star game, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; she excitedly proclaimed on the WNBA&#8217;s orange carpet on the eve of the game.</p>
<p>Megan Rapinoe, Women&#8217;s World Cup hero and star of the Seattle Reign and U.S. Women&#8217;s National Team, was on hand in Vegas to support her girlfriend, WNBA star Sue Bird. She, too, was thrilled that the advertisements across the city didn&#8217;t go out of their way to express the inspirational nature of the of the sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously they&#8217;re going to inspire girls and boys playing basketball because that&#8217;s where they want to get, but to always lead with that &#8212; it leaves so much short when it comes to the potential of it,&#8221; said Rapinoe.</p>

<p>During the Women&#8217;s World Cup, FIFA was criticized &#8212; including by <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/pay-the-uswnt-more-money-2d1e98c8b3d1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThinkProgress</a> &#8212; for its patronizing slogan, &#8220;Dare to Dream.&#8221; (Female athletes have always dreamed; FIFA and other organizations at the top of the sport have been actively destroying those dreams by failing to adequately invest in women&#8217;s sports.)</p>
<p>But FIFA is far from the only organization that often falls back on promoting women&#8217;s sports as a social justice obligation, rather than entertainment. The WNBA has done this, as well.</p>
<p>In 2018, the WNBA unveiled its &#8220;Take a Seat, Take a Stand&#8221; campaign, which was a &#8220;women and girls empowerment program.&#8221; It leaned heavily on marketing the WNBA as part of the broader women&#8217;s movement, and announced that a portion of each ticket sale would be dedicated to one of six WNBA partners, including Planned Parenthood and the United States of Women. All of this was, on the surface, perfectly nice, inspiring, and on-brand for a league whose players have been outspoken about social justice issues. But the campaign was unveiled without input from the players, and some were upset that none of the official partners were associated with the Black Lives Matter movement or ending police brutality.</p>
<p>And there was also something uncomfortable about so heavily tying the sport to charity, and in taking a portion of ticket sales away from the WNBA itself at a time when the league claims it can&#8217;t pay the players more.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the league&#8217;s ad campaign seemed to forget about the fact that people should support WNBA games because they are physical, competitive, flashy, feisty, and a whole lot of fun. There&#8217;s plenty of inspiration on the court for every game, it doesn&#8217;t have to be manufactured by marketing consultants.</p>
<p>Last month, the WNBA&#8217;s new commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, came on board after a long career as the CEO of Deloitte, a professional services firm. Since she comes from the corporate world, she&#8217;s expected to be focused primarily on turning the league into a profitable business. But in a conversation with ThinkProgress three days into her tenure, Engelbert repeatedly stressed that she took the job with the WNBA because she wanted to do &#8220;something with a broad women&#8217;s leadership platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked whether she viewed the WNBA as a sport or a cause, Engelbert said that both were in play.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s what makes the W so unique is that [these things aren&#8217;t] mutually exclusive with one another. You can have very socially minded community oriented, elite athletes playing a game they love &#8230; broadening the fan base, but always knowing that they ultimately have a maybe a broader mission behind what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;So you kind of have to follow the athlete.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the athlete is an important step &#8212; in the summer of 2016, the WNBA brass created tension with its players when it tried to quell Black Lives Matter protests. Many WNBA players identify as activists, and should be encouraged to use their voices and platform. But if there&#8217;s no interest in the platform itself, then their voices won&#8217;t be amplified, they&#8217;ll be lost in the abyss.</p>
<p>Female athletes aren&#8217;t always going to be perfect role models. The biggest stars might not always be comfortable being the faces of political movements, or advocates for change. So relying on those two things as the main selling point of the league is precarious at best.</p>
<p>The WNBA has come a long way since its early days. It now celebrates the individuality of its players, both through their pre-game styles and by being more openly welcoming to those who are lesbian, bisexual, and/or gender nonconforming. In Las Vegas last weekend, married Chicago Sky teammates Allie Quigley and Courtney Vandersloot were both All-Stars. They walked the orange carpet together, and were interviewed about playing against each other. It was wonderful to see their relationship out in the open and celebrated. But it was <em>also</em> wonderful that this was just a fun side story to the main event, a basketball game between the best players in the world.</p>
<p>As Rapinoe said, the focus on these female athletes doesn&#8217;t have to end with the sport itself, but it should always start there. In Vegas, it was confirmed that not only is this approach possible, it&#8217;s downright popular.	</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Senate passed a two-year budget agreement on Thursday, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">67-28</a>, sending the bipartisan legislation to President Donald Trump&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The agreement includes a suspension of the debt ceiling until after the November 2020 elections.</p>
<p>Despite Trump&#8217;s stated support for the deal and his previous urging, 23 of the 53 Republicans in the Senate voted against the deal. Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Tom Carper (D-DE), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Jon Tester (D-MT) also voted nay.</p>
<p>The common refrain from those Republicans voting no on Thursday was that, while they liked the bill&#8217;s increases in defense spending, they were concerned that it did not do enough to address the Trump administration&#8217;s all-time record budget deficit and national debt.</p>
<p>But a large reason for the nation&#8217;s projected <a href="https://www.axios.com/white-house-projects-1-trillion-deficit-for-2019-ee45c1b0-44d3-4c94-9f02-442e8fcf61dc.html">trillion dollar annual deficit in 2019</a> is that two years ago, the Republican Congress passed the so-called &#8220;Tax Cut and Jobs Act,&#8221; a massive tax cut that mostly benefited the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Though the bill&#8217;s supporters claimed it would pay for itself with economic growth, even its main author now <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/kevin-brady-gop-tax-bill-deficit-149f49bd7895/">admits</a> that was not true. As Trump repeatedly touts the greatest economy ever, revenues are down since its enactment. The cost of the tax cuts is estimated to be in the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/28/tax-cuts-trump-gop-analysis-430781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trillions</a> over a decade.</p>
<p>The senators voting against the budget deal on Thursday after previously backing the tax cuts included Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Braun (R-IN),  Bill Cassidy, (R-LA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rand Paul (R-KY), Jim Risch (R-ID), <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Mitt Romney (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), </span>Rick Scott (R-FL), Tim Scott (R-SC), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Pat Toomey (R-PA).</p>
<p>All 18 of of those who were in the Senate at the time <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted for</a> the tax bill in December 2017. Blackburn, then a representative in the lower chamber of Congress, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll699.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voted</a> for the identical bill in the House. While <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2018/10/05/heres-what-joe-donnelly-mike-braun-say-donald-trumps-tax-cuts/1496344002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Braun</a>, <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article181018441.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawley</a>, <a href="https://www.romneyforutah.com/issues-taxes/">Romney</a>, and <a href="http://sunshinestatenews.com/story/tax-reform-vote-set-be-issue-2018-senate-race-florida">Rick Scott</a> were not yet in Congress when the vote happened, all four backed the bill publicly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday it will extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, affecting nearly 7,000 Syrians living legally in the United States. Protections for Syria were officially set to expire under the program on September 30, 2019, leaving families just two months to pack up their lives and return to Syria, or risk deportation.</p>
<p>The news was first made <a href="https://www.rescue.org/press-release/irc-trump-administration-must-reconsider-syria-tps-decision" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public</a> by several <a href="https://twitter.com/Re4mImmigration/status/1156973170026565633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advocacy groups</a> earlier Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Extending TPS allows those who are already protected to remain legally in the United States, however the administration&#8217;s decision to not re-designate shuts out future Syrian immigrants from applying for TPS. If the Trump administration were to re-designate the program rather than simply extend it, an additional 7,000 Syrians would be eligible for protections.</p>
<p>The TPS program designation — which grants temporary work authorization to certain immigrants from countries ravaged by war, natural disasters, or disease — does not lead to any kind of pathway to citizenship, so TPS recipients are at the whim of presidents who may decide to cancel the program.</p>
<p>Syria became a TPS designated country in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/03/29/2012-7498/designation-of-syrian-arab-republic-for-temporary-protected-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012</a> following the State Department&#8217;s <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2012/03/29/2012-7498/designation-of-syrian-arab-republic-for-temporary-protected-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">determination </a>that President Bashar al-Assad used the military to suppress protests through violent and deadly repression tactics. The decision was extended and re-designated four more times. In January of 2018, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen wrote in her decision to extend the program that “it is clear that the conditions upon which Syria’s designation was based continue to exist, therefore an extension is warranted under the statute. &#8221;</p>
<p>Over a year later after TPS for Syrians was last extended, the conflict in Syria is still far from over. According to Syrian media, more than 100 civilians were killed in Syria over the course of just 10 days in July. Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, over 560,000 people have been killed.</p>
<p><span class="gmail-m_7720127972982492432gmail-m-2713857326413648491m-845911806860115894gmail-il">&#8220;TPS</span> continues to be crucial for <span class="gmail-m_7720127972982492432gmail-m-2713857326413648491m-845911806860115894gmail-il">thousands</span> of <span class="gmail-m_7720127972982492432gmail-m-2713857326413648491m-845911806860115894gmail-il">Syrians</span> in the <span class="gmail-m_7720127972982492432gmail-m-2713857326413648491m-845911806860115894gmail-il">US,&#8221; American Relief Coalition for Syria said in a statement. &#8220;</span>It allows them to work legally, to build business, to continue their education, but most importantly, to live in peace and security [&#8230;]. <span class="gmail-m_7720127972982492432gmail-m-2713857326413648491m-845911806860115894gmail-il">Syrians</span> should not be forced to return to a country where violence and the threat of barrel bombs <span class="gmail-m_7720127972982492432gmail-m-2713857326413648491m-845911806860115894gmail-il">has</span> become a norm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monzer Shakally, a 23-year-old student at the University of Iowa&#8217;s College of Dentistry, has lived in the United States since 2012, after he was detained at age 16 by the Syrian government for participating in a peaceful protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t really anyway to prepare for this,&#8221; Shakally told ThinkProgress. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only help I have is my friends and close relatives, prayers, and their support.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Shakally, whose only family member in the United States is his brother, a doctor in California, says that for thousands of Syrians, going back is not an option.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As stressful as it is, I have it a lot better compared to others: I&#8217;m single, I have family that is really supportive in terms of mental and financial support, I have a bachelors from an American college,&#8221; Shakally said. &#8220;For some people going back to Syria is not a possibility, it will be a death sentence for them. Keeping those people in mind is what keeps me motivated to fight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The situation in Syria is extremely dangerous,&#8221; he added. &#8220;People live for the day. You know, people [in the United States] joke about how they want to live for the day, but it&#8217;s really not as fun as it sounds when you could leave your house and never come back.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Permanent solutions for immigrants from countries like Syria has never been more necessary. However, the Trump administration is currently debating whether to accept zero refugees next fiscal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Since Trump became president, U.S. refugee levels have been dropping at an alarming rate. This year alone, the administration cut refugee admissions by a third to just 30,000, the lowest refugee admissions goal in the history of the program. The United States has only welcomed 461 Syrian refugees in fiscal year-to-date 2019; a 96% drop from 2016.</span></p>
<p>Other countries with TPS designation include Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras, Nepal, Sudan, and Nicaragua. When the Trump administration decided to end protections for six out of the 10 TPS designated countries, thousands of families were placed in limbo. Faced with a court injunction, in early March, the administration temporarily extended protections for nearly 94% of all TPS holders until January 2020. This included 200,000 TPS holders from El Salvador, 50,000 from Haiti, 2,500 from Nicaragua, and 1,000 from Sudan. Protections for Nepalese and Honduran TPS holders are currently being battled over in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>One way to secure protections for all TPS holders is for Congress to pass the Dream and Promise Act, a bill which would provide a path to citizenship not only for undocumented youth brought to the United States as children, but also for immigrants with TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED). Under the bill, TPS and DED holders will receive lawful permanent residence status if they have been in the United States for three years before the bill is enacted, were eligible for TPS on September 25, 2016 or had DED status as of September 28, 2016. The House of Representatives passed the Dream and Promise Act in early June, however the majority-Republican Senate is unlikely to take it up for a vote.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newly unsealed federal search warrants have revealed the extent to which the man who attacked the Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego this April was inspired by the far-right extremist who attacked two mosques in New Zealand earlier this year.</p>
<p>John T. Earnest, 19, has been charged with one count of murder, the attempted murder of 53 people, and 109 counts of federal hate crimes. On April 27, Earnest opened fire on a Passover service at the Chabad of Poway synagogue, killing one and injuring three before fleeing the scene and being captured by police. Less than a week prior, Earnest had tried to set fire to a mosque in Escondido, California.</p>
<p>The similarities between Earnest&#8217;s attack and the one that happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, were apparent from the start.</p>
<p>Like the Christchurch shooter, Earnest released a manifesto in advance of the shooting, which touted his European heritage and went on a conspiracy-filled ramble about how an &#8220;other&#8221; group (In Earnest&#8217;s case Jews, in the Christchurch shooter&#8217;s case Muslims) were conspiring to bring down the white race. Like the Christchurch shooter, Earnest also attempted to livestream the attack on Facebook.</p>
<p>The extent of Earnest&#8217;s praise of the New Zealand attack, however, did not become clear until Tuesday, when Superior Court Presiding Judge Peter Deddeh unsealed more than 300 pages of court documents related to the case, at the request of five news organizations including the Associated Press and several local outlets. Their lawyer, Elizabeth Baldridge, had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/media-wants-search-warrants-unsealed-from-synagogue-attack/2019/07/25/fbce00e6-ae96-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html?utm_term=.396304fd1680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that the public &#8220;has a substantial interest in understanding the motivations behind these crimes and obtaining transparency in the process of bringing the alleged perpetrators to justice.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.626722/gov.uscourts.casd.626722.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Previous search warrants</a> that were made public in June showed Earnest told the FBI post-arrest that he had been &#8220;inspired by individuals such as Adolph Hitler and [New Zealand Shooter] Brenton Tarrant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest warrants further expand upon Earnest&#8217;s obsession with the New Zealand shooter. As reported by <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/jul/31/warrants-new-details-poway-synagogue-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KPBS</a>, in the days after the attack Earnest complained over text to a person that he wasn&#8217;t able to watch the shooting livestreamed. He also described the shooter&#8217;s manifesto as &#8220;spot on with everything&#8221; and that it was &#8220;important that everyone should read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earnest <a href="https://ktla.com/2019/07/31/warrants-say-new-zealand-attack-inspired-poway-synagogue-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also prepared for the attack</a> by opening an Amazon account and using it to buy equipment in advance of the shooting, including an ammunition holder, a tactical helmet and a &#8220;GoPro&#8221; camera. Earnest also legally purchased an AR-15 rifle from a local San Diego gun shop just prior to the attack. Authorities suspect he may have used his family&#8217;s hunting license to do so, since it&#8217;s illegal in California for anyone under the age of 21 to buy a rifle unless they are a member of the military or hold a hunting license.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/extremist-manifestos-are-being-memeticized-1880dca8c7b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThinkProgress has previously outlined</a>, the connections between Earnest and the New Zealand shooter show how far-right attacks bounce off each other, offering inspiration and creating further radicalization.</p>
<p>“They’re not acting alone in terms of being inspired, gathering information, tactical knowledge, ideology. It’s clear that the pace of that dissemination is increasing,” Zahed Amanullah, resident senior fellow at the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, previously told ThinkProgress. “That’s the real concern, because the bar is being lowered and lowered for someone to be inspired by the manifesto and to take action themselves.”	</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a series of revelations over the past week, the CEO of Overstock.com has claimed that he had a sexual relationship with convicted Russian agent Maria Butina, and that the FBI encouraged him to continue such a relationship.</p>
<p>One of Butina&#8217;s lawyers, Robert Driscoll, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/420475766/Letter-from-Maria-Butina-Lawyer-to-Justice-Department-25-July-2019">revealed in a letter to the Justice Department</a> last month that the 57-year-old Byrne maintained a relationship with Butina.</p>
<p>Byrne said that he initially met Butina at the 2015 FreedomFest, an annual libertarian convention. He <a href="https://saraacarter.com/russia-probe-twist-a-billion-dollar-ceo-a-convicted-russian-agent-and-the-fbi/">said</a> Butina claimed she was working for Alexander Torshin, who was then working as an official at the Russian Central Bank. Torshin, who has been <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/russian-politician-who-reportedly-sent-millions-to-nra-has-long-history-in-spain">accused</a> by authorities in Europe of overseeing massive money laundering operations, is <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338">now sanctioned</a> by the U.S. for his role in Russia&#8217;s kleptocratic regime.</p>
<iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="//www.scribd.com/embeds/420475766/content?start_page=1&view_mode=&access_key=key-ZcAFCuzzhdbsn3Bq1H87" data-auto-height="true" scrolling="no" id="scribd_420475766" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<div style="font-size:10px;text-align:center;width:100%"><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/420475766" target="_blank">View this document on Scribd</a></div>
<p>Byrne <a href="https://saraacarter.com/russia-probe-twist-a-billion-dollar-ceo-a-convicted-russian-agent-and-the-fbi/">added</a> that Butina claimed she was working at Torshin&#8217;s behest in order to build up contacts in the administration of whoever won the 2016 election, saying she wanted to allow Russian liberals a platform within the new White House. It&#8217;s unclear which Russian liberals Butina would have been describing: Not only was Torshin firmly in the pro-government camp in Russia, but Butina has previously been one of the most outspoken figures supporting Russia&#8217;s attempts to disintegrate Ukraine, including <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/russian-malefactors-rally-for-maria-butina-bcd97b91749d/">promoting</a> the arming of pro-Kremlin separatists in Ukraine.</p>
<p>As ThinkProgress has <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/russian-malefactors-rally-for-maria-butina-bcd97b91749d/">reported</a>, at least one other sanctioned Russian, Alexander Malkevich, is currently involved in fundraising on Butina&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>Byrne says he developed an intimate relationship with Butina through early 2016, after which it was broken off. Driscoll&#8217;s letter noted that Byrne said he had a &#8220;non-standard arrangement&#8221; with the FBI, and that he &#8220;communicated and assisted government agents with their investigation of Maria.&#8221; The letter notes that American officials instructed Byrne to restart his relationship with Butina in the lead-up to the 2016 election.</p>
<p>As the letter read:</p>
<blockquote><p>At some point prior to the 2016 election, when Byrne’s contact with Maria diminished or ceased, the government asked and encouraged him to renew contact with her and he did so, continuing to inform the government of her activities. Byrne states he was informed by government agents that his pursuit and involvement with Maria (and concomitant surveillance of her) was requested and directed from the highest levels of the FBI and intelligence community.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byrne later denied that this second portion of his relationship with Butina was intimate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The second period, I did it because I was instructed to rekindle it. However, I decided that was not the right thing to do,” Byrne told the Washington Examiner. “But I was told where the orders came from, and the orders came from high enough that I accepted the orders. I just want America to know that I didn’t lay a finger on her that second time.”</span></p>

<h3 class="related-content__title">Leading voices in Russian interference efforts rally to support Maria Butina</h3>
<p class="related-content__dek">The main organizer of American secessionists, a sanctioned disinformation operative, and a leading anti-gay official are joining forces to raise money for Butina.</p>

<p>Driscoll&#8217;s <a href="https://saraacarter.com/russia-probe-twist-a-billion-dollar-ceo-a-convicted-russian-agent-and-the-fbi/">letter</a> noted that Byrne claimed Butina&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">behavior and interaction with him was inconsistent with her being a foreign agent and more likely an idealist and age-appropriate peace activist.” The letter added that Byrne &#8220;conveyed [Byrne&#8217;s] thoughts and the corroborating facts and observations about Maria to the government.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This is the first time Byrne&#8217;s name has been linked with Butina. Byrne said that he met with Justice Department officials earlier this year, but his relationship with Butina never came up during Butina&#8217;s prosecution. It is also the second known romantic relationship Butina carried out in the U.S. The other was with another 57-year-old, GOP operative Paul Erickson, who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/06/687417296/paul-erickson-boyfriend-of-russian-agent-maria-butina-charged-in-fraud-scheme">was charged</a> earlier this year with wire fraud.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have been involved with three peace efforts in my life, and stranger things have happened than that someone positive came from such an encounter,&#8221; Byrne said. &#8220;However, I was also keenly aware that she might be a Red Sparrow instead.”</span>	</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KABUL, AFGHANISTAN &#8212; The Democratic presidential candidates during their debate in Detroit, Michigan this week raised the issue of withdrawing U.S. troops from the 18-year war in Afghanistan, a goal which many appeared to be broadly in agreement about.</p>
<p>But while they broached the subject of U.S. military deaths and the duration of the military&#8217;s presence, the people of Afghanistan — who themselves are about to hold a presidential election in September —  were rarely mentioned. In fact, the presidential contenders avoided any mention of the toll the Afghan people have been paying in the nearly two decades since the US-led invasion.</p>
<p>Neither the moderators nor the candidates spoke about the fact, for example, that the United Nations attributed 89% of the 519 civilian casualties in the first six months of 2019 — 363 deaths and 156 injured — to international military forces.</p>
<p>Nor did they address the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/world/asia/afghanistan-campaign-attack-amrullah-saleh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attack</a> targeting a vice presidential candidate in Kabul that led to 20 deaths, dozens of injuries, and the decimation of an entire neighborhood on the first day of campaigning for September’s presidential elections.</p>
<p>What the candidates did mention was the deaths of two <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49157007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. service members</a> in Kandahar on Monday. The deaths of those two soldiers brings the number of US troops <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/07/31/army-identifies-two-soldiers-killed-in-afghanistan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killed</a> in Afghanistan so far this year to 12.</p>

Tim Ryan (D-OH) speaks as former housing secretary Julian Castro looks on during the first night of the Democratic presidential debate on June 26, 2019 in Miami, Florida.

<p>Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend Indiana, referred to the seven months he spent as a solder in Afghanistan in 2014. Buttigieg asserted that if he were to win the presidency, he would withdraw the remaining 14,000 US troops within his first year in office.</p>
<p>“I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan when I thought I was turning out the lights years ago,” said Buttigieg, who left Afghanistan just as Barack Obama was leading the withdrawal of the majority of foreign troops in the country.</p>
<p>Buttigieg’s rhetoric focused entirely on U.S. soldiers serving in the country. There was no mention of a single Afghan in any of the mayor’s comments on the Afghan war.</p>
<p>“Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague.”</p>
<p>Other candidates, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) called for a US troop pullout from Afghanistan. One exception was John Hickenlooper, former Governor of Colorado, who made vague allusions to the status of women — which the Bush administration often cited as an impetus for the 2001 invasion — and a potential “humanitarian disaster.”</p>
<p>Though Hickenlooper did acknowledge that there are more than 30 million people living in the country, what he was not able to do was provide any details that would have helped the American public identify with a war that <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/10/08/most-americans-would-support-withdrawal-afghanista" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">61%</a> of the public want out of.</p>
<p>The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said in a <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/unama_poc_midyear_update_2019_-_30_july_english.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> this week that in the first six months of. 2019, the conflict in Afghanistan has caused 3,812 civilian casualties &#8212; including 1,366 deaths.</p>
<p>None of the candidates, not even Hickenlooper, mentioned Trump’s recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/i-just-dont-want-to-kill-10-million-people-trumps-comments-reverberate-in-afghanistan/2019/07/23/88e8d15e-ad0c-11e9-b071-94a3f4d59021_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarks</a> that he could have solved the Afghan war “literally in 10 days” by killing 10 million people. Nor was there a single mention made about the so-called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/opinion/mother-of-all-bombs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mother of All Bombs</a>,” the world’s largest non-nuclear weapon, that Trump dropped on a village in Eastern Afghanistan in 2017.</p>

<h3 class="related-content__title">Afghan officials are shut out of the U.S.-Taliban peace talks. That&#8217;s proving to be a problem.</h3>
<p class="related-content__dek">What&#039;s at stake if these talks fail?</p>

<p>On the second night, Sen. Corey Booker (D-NJ) vowed, like the other candidates, that he too would “bring our troops home, and I will bring them home as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>But in a move that saw him separate himself from former President Barack Obama, Booker said he “will not set during a campaign an artificial deadline” for a US troop withdrawal.</p>
<p>Booker may have made the biggest gaffe on Afghanistan of any candidate in the two nights of debates when he vowed to avoid any decision that could create a potential “vacuum that&#8217;s ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East.” Afghanistan is, of course, not in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who served briefly in Iraq and continues to serve as a major in the Hawaii National Guard, took a similar approach to Buttigieg, making remarks centered entirely on U.S. service members.</p>
<p>“My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now. Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan …This is about leadership, the leadership I will bring to do the right thing to bring our troops home, within the first year in office, because they shouldn&#8217;t have been there this long,” Gabbard said.</p>
<p>Another issue absent from the two nights of debate was the Taliban, the largest armed opposition movement in Afghanistan and the group responsible for some of the most audacious attacks in the country’s history. This is especially notable given the fact that the Trump administration is currently engaged in face-to-face peace talks with the group.</p>
<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-usa-pompeo/us-secretary-of-state-pompeo-visits-kabul-hopes-for-a-peace-deal-before-september-1-idUSKCN1TQ20X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit</a> to Kabul, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he expects a conclusion to the months-long peace talks between Washington and the Taliban by the beginning of September.</p>
<p>At a time of stark political divides, a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan is one issue Democrats and Republicans largely seem to agree on. Leading Democrats, including <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton</a>, <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/15186/39906/26732/limits-funding-for-war-in-afghanistan-to-the-withdrawal-of-us-forces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy Pelosi</a> and 2020 contender <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/features/joe-biden-iraq-war-vote-democratic-primary-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Biden</a>, once voted in favor of the United States’ Afghan incursion. Now Biden, when speaking about the longest-ever US foreign war, says he will end Washington’s &#8220;<a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/07/11/joe-biden-i-promise-to-end-the-forever-wars-in-afghanistan-and-middle-east-as-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forever wars</a>,&#8221; including in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It was during Biden&#8217;s tenure as vice president under President Barack Obama that the United States ramped up the use of drones, a policy that by 2013 would lead to Afghanistan being named “<a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/drone-war/data/afghanistan-reported-us-covert-actions-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most drone-bombed country</a>” in the world. In a 2010 biography, he was quoted as saying that he and Obama both <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/08/biden-on-the-afghanistan-debate-in-his-own-words/60868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed</a> that “We were not in Afghanistan for nation building.” Biden was not asked about his plans for Afghanistan during Tuesday and Wednesday nights&#8217; debate.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/2020-democratic-debate-ryan-gabbard-big-truth-afghanistan-war-september-11-taliban-us-policy-f5cb5e041991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">again</a>, the crowded pool of Democratic presidential hopefuls showed that they have very little understanding of the war in Afghanistan, and even less about the people there paying the highest cost.	</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A handful of New York lawmakers want to make it a felony to dump a bucket of water on a police officer.</p>
<p>The quixotic legislative push is the result of a mounting, week-long fearmongering campaign from conservative media figures eager to highlight viral videos of people in New York City tossing water on cops.</p>
<p>“This time, it’s water. But what’s next? Gasoline? Acid?” said Assemblyman Mike LiPetri (R) at a press conference Wednesday.</p>
<p>Throwing acid, gas, or other harmful substances on anyone is already a crime. Aiming such an assault at a police officer is already a special category of crime carrying additional punishment. The NYPD has already made arrests in the “water attacks” and pushed additional resources into pursuing others seen in the videos.</p>
<p>But the redundant nature of LiPetri’s new law is no obstacle to its political utility for conservatives. The political right is eager to tamp down the bevy of evidence that police around the country abuse their authority over citizens on a routine basis.</p>
<p>And so it was no surprise that Fox News leapt to LiPetri’s aid on Thursday morning, inviting on his State Assembly ally Mike Reilly (R) and Ed Mullins of the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA) police union to tout the bill and dismiss the idea that cops might have earned some public disdain through their actions.</p>
<p>After host Bill Hemmer told the pair he’d have been arrested if he’d thrown water on a cop during his childhood in Ohio, he invited them to explain why this is happening in New York. The two immediately blamed city leaders and mass criticism of NYPD violence.</p>
<p>“Well you don’t have Mayor di Blasio in Ohio, you don’t have Police Commissioner O’Neil in Ohio,” the SBA’s Mullins said. “You don’t have the Pantaleo effect that has now crippled the NYPD.”</p>
<p>Hemmer interjected that “Pantaleo’s the officer who was connected to the Eric Garner.”</p>
<p>Indeed, that “connection” is that Pantaleo killed Eric Garner, according to the medical examiner who testified at the former man’s administrative trial earlier this year. The &#8220;Pantaleo effect&#8221; could thus be remedied by police taking the necessary steps to not needlessly kill people. This fix would likely have the concomitant effect of ameliorating much of this &#8220;buckets of water tossed on police&#8221; problem.</p>
<p>This logic proved elusive for Reilly, who later in the segment reiterated the notion that the “Pantaleo effect” is causing police to become “hesitant,&#8221; thus reducing overall safety for both officers and community members.</p>
<div class="responsive-video"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rPnsP-RX7o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>
<p>It’s worth unpacking the twinned aspects of soft-power rhetoric and hard-power legislative ideation here.</p>
<p>Creating a new felony specifically for throwing or squirting water at or on a police officer would not just be redundant to existing assault laws currently being used to go after the people in the videos. In another sense, the proposed law is an attempt to de-criminalize one of the most common abuses of authority in all of policing.</p>
<p>People are already being arrested at high rates for simply being impolite to police officers. This unconstitutional, illegal practice is so common that it has its own name in law enforcement jargon. “<a href="https://thinkprogress.org/trump-order-wont-make-cops-safer-but-might-make-it-a-felony-to-yell-at-them-6ebfa58dae47/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contempt of cop</a>” is not a crime you’ll find in any law book. But in practice, on the street, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/19/im-a-cop-if-you-dont-want-to-get-hurt-dont-challenge-me/?utm_term=.fa4989f2f3e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cops will find a reason to put the hooks on you for being rude or uncooperative</a>.</p>
<p>These illegal arrests and harassment are hard to curb even when an appointed or elected official has the will to try. They are ghosts in the law enforcement machine, <a href="https://wamu.org/projects/assault-on-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disguised in the official bookings record</a> as “resisting arrest” or “assaulting an officer.”</p>

<h3 class="related-content__title">Trump order won’t make cops safer, but might make it a felony to yell at them</h3>
<p class="related-content__dek">“Contempt of cop” is a big enough problem already. The president seems determined to make it worse.</p>
</p></div>
<p>	</a>
</div>
<p>But officers who know they’re being watched and recorded are less likely to press ahead with illegal “contempt of cop” arrests. Cell phone cameras change police behavior, to be sure – just not in the way that law enforcement hardliners like LiPetri, Reilly, and Hemmer would have you believe.</p>
<p>In the five years since Officer Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown in the St. Louis exurbs, law enforcement officials have worked hard to persuade the public that the resulting scrutiny of police practices is doing more harm than good. Often, they refer to a supposed “Ferguson effect,” alluding to Wilson’s killing of Brown. The language shifts sometimes – former FBI Director Jim Comey called it the “viral video effect” in 2015, for example. Today’s “Pantaleo effect” remarks on Fox are just a fresh coat of paint on this same concept.</p>
<p>The idea is that police retreat from their duties in the face of public scrutiny and distrust. There is likely some truth to that claim, in a vacuum. It certainly makes intuitive sense that as armed agents of the state lose legitimacy with the communities they occupy while on duty, it becomes harder for them to effectively solve crimes.</p>
<p>But agents of the law enforcement backlash go further than noting a mere correlation. They insist it is the public’s fault that their police force is becoming ineffective – entirely ignoring the question of whether police have lost public trust through their own actions. This rhetorical dodge reached its apotheosis under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who openly accused black civil rights activists of causing murders and shootings through their critiques of police violence, corruption, and abuse of office.</p>
<p>LiPetri offered his own version of the same opposite-day logic at Wednesday&#8217;s presser.</p>
<p>“What will it take for radical left-wing politicians to abandon their hostile, anti-police rhetoric toward law enforcement?&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC7NY/status/1156566643994177538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. &#8220;This detestable anti-police narrative has created a divisive climate, an us-versus-them mentality.”</p>
<p>Catch that? The breakdown in relations between police and citizens is not caused by killer cops like Pantaleo, <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/philando-castile-dash-cam-video-footage-952574c6052c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeronimo Yanez</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/us/oscar-grant-shooting-bart-internal-investigation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johannes Mehserle</a>, <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/jason-van-dyke-murdered-laquan-mcdonald-jury-finds-f0e06ab65afb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Van Dyke</a>, and <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/change-training-sean-bell-fatal-shooting-article-1.2880446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Oliver</a>. It&#8217;s not caused by the thousands of other officers whose names we don&#8217;t know who engage in &#8220;contempt of cop&#8221; arrests and other illegal and humiliating practices. It&#8217;s caused by the people who refuse to accept those abuses quietly, who demand some accountability for officers who violate people&#8217;s rights.</p>

<h3 class="related-content__title">Black communities stop calling 911 after instances of police brutality, research shows</h3>
<p class="related-content__dek">New research proves black communities stop calling 911 after police abuse hits the news.</p>
</p></div>
<p>	</a>
</div>
<p>Everyone involved in these conversations knows that it’s already a crime to actually assault an officer. Everyone involved in these conversations knows that police officers abusing their authority rapidly destroy community trust. Everyone involved in these conversations knows that “contempt of cop” is already unofficially criminal. What&#8217;s needed is a conversation about how police officers might change their thinking and behavior to better serve a rightfully suspicious public.</p>
<p>But Fox News has tremendous power over the U.S. populace. Citizens who rely on Fox for their news believe they live in an entirely different country and reality to the one everyone else sees. The channel’s Rasputin-like hold on its tens of millions of viewers allows it to advance the sophisticated political project it was conceived and launched to pursue. When Fox picks up an idea and flogs it relentlessly, it can impose the liturgy of its lunatic fringe on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>That’s what this segment is about. The lawmakers and police union officials behind this unnecessary and absurd proposed criminal statute know they have little chance of winning a fair fight in Albany. But they also understand that getting the vast Fox News horde to howl in support of their bad idea might level the odds a bit.</p>
<p>And even if they don’t ultimately pass this redundant, retrograde criminal penalty into law, they will have pushed the underlying ideological campaign forward.	</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) on Thursday was asked about Senate colleague Kamala Harris&#8217; (D-CA) criticism of a for-profit immigration detention center for kids in his home state, a facility where she said kids are treated like criminals.</p>
<p>Scott responded by arguing that Harris&#8217; opinion did not matter because the facility had been around for five years and Harris had done nothing about it when it first opened.</p>
<p>Harris, of course, was not a member of the Senate at that time.</p>
<p>At Wednesday night&#8217;s Democratic presidential debate, the California lawmaker recounted her recent experience trying to visit the largely unregulated <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/pastor-tells-fox-news-immigrant-detention-center-fine-because-kids-pray-weekly-and-dont-complain-1ebc2ae21f1e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homestead detention center</a> near Miami, Florida. &#8220;T<span id="transcript39449410000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39449410000">here is a private </span><span id="transcript39469430000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39469430000">detention facility being paid </span><span id="transcript39489450000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39489450000">for by your taxpayer dollars, a </span><span id="transcript39513810000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39513810000">private detention facility that </span><span id="transcript39530830000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39530830000">currently houses 2,700 children,&#8221; she said. &#8220;</span><span id="transcript39549510000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39549510000">I saw children lined up, single-</span><span id="transcript39579540000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39579540000">file based on gender, being </span><span id="transcript39599560000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39599560000">walked into barracks. </span><span id="transcript39635600000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39635600000">These children should not be </span><span id="transcript39665300000" class="transcriptBlock boldedCCLine" data-ticks="39665300000">treated like criminals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span id="transcript39665300000" class="transcriptBlock boldedCCLine" data-ticks="39665300000">On Thursday, Fox News asked Scott, who was Florida&#8217;s governor from 2011 to 2019, about Harris&#8217; comments. He offered no defense of the facility &#8212; which the Trump administration has tried to expand &#8212; saying simply, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been down to Homestead.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>He then launched into a bizarre attack on Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).</p>
<p><span id="transcript39889850000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39889850000">&#8220;If you look at </span><span id="transcript39903200000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39903200000">this, it was opened in 2014,&#8221; Scott noted. &#8220;</span><span id="transcript39942570000" class="transcriptBlock" data-ticks="39942570000">Where was Kamala Harris in 2014?

<div class="responsive-video"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJ-m2AqFUYs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>
<p>It was unclear why Scott believed that senators should be disqualified from speaking out about the current conditions at a facility just because it has been open for a few years.</p>
<p>Additionally, Harris was the attorney general of California in 2014, and had no jurisdiction or involvement in Florida-based federal child immigration detention centers. She did not become a U.S. senator until January 2017, and has been in the minority for her entire two-and-a-half-year tenure.</p>
<p>And where was Warren in 2014? While she was in her first term in the Senate, she had just voted for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed 68 to 32. Despite promises that the House would act on it, the Republican leadership in that chamber never did so.</p>
<p>Scott has himself served in elected office in Florida and now in Congress for eight and a half years. He has yet to solve the country&#8217;s asylum laws or secure the border as Republicans have suggested the government should.	</p>
