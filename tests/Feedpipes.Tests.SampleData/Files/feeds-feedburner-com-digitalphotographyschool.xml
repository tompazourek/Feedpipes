<p>Whether you&#8217;re working with clients or shoot as a lone ranger, you need to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/create-a-backup-today/">back up your work</a>. As the saying goes, when it comes to hard drives, it&#8217;s not a matter of<em> if they will fail,</em> but <em>when they will fail</em>.</p>
<p>Working with image files requires a lot of power and is very taxing for your computer. This increases the chance of hard drive failure. <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;">You need to have a system of backing up your images that works for you. This is also important to backup your photos while shooting tethered.</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-173960 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/K3A8498.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="how-to-backup-your-photos-while-shooting-tethered-3" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/K3A8498.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/K3A8498.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/K3A8498.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/K3A8498.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/K3A8498.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/K3A8498.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;">Backup your photos while shooting tethered</span></h2>
<p>There are various programs that allow you to connect your camera to a laptop or desktop computer via a USB cable. This allows you to view a larger and more accurate version of your image on the computer screen. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tutorial-shoot-tethered/">Tethering</a> is crucial in genres like <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/dps-ultimate-guide-food-photography/">food</a> and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/apply-compositional-theory-to-still-life-photography/">still life photography</a>, but also very useful in other niches, like studio <a href="https://resources.digital-photography-school.com/download/portraits-book/">portrait photography</a>.</p>
<p>When shooting tethered while on location, an efficient workflow around the backup process will make your life a lot easier and ensure that you have several copies of your image files should an unforeseen incident occur.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me and shoot tethered to a laptop but edit on a desktop, you already have the bonus of an extra copy of your images, since you&#8217;re using two computers.</p>
<p>If you transfer the images from the laptop to desktop via a detachable external hard drive, there is your third copy. However, if you use a card reader or transfer your images from your camera via a USB cable, you should have at least one more hard copy of your images. Also, what if something happens to your laptop while you&#8217;re on a shoot? Remember, it&#8217;s a question of <em>when.</em></p>
<p>Do you use <strong>Lightroom</strong> as your tethering program of choice? You then have the option of saving your images to your SD cards as you take them. However, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/capture-one-pro-switch/">Capture One Pro</a> doesn&#8217;t offer this option. This makes image capture instant, but it doesn&#8217;t give you an extra sense of security by providing additional copies of the images you&#8217;ve shot.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot just set up Lightroom or COP to save to two places. You need file synchronization software to make sure that your work is being backed up while you&#8217;re shooting tethered. </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Types of backups</strong></h2>
<p>There are two types of backup: <strong>specific project backup</strong> and <strong>overall data backup</strong>. You need to concern yourself with both.</p>
<p>While you&#8217;re shooting, you need to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/create-a-backup-today/">back up</a> every single file. You also need to do a backup of your whole computer. <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">You should create backups on external hard drives and also in a cloud-based system. Don&#8217;t simply rely on cloud solutions for your backups.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Storing photos in the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/are-your-photos-safe-in-the-cloud/">cloud</a> basically outsources the storage of your photos. The data in the cloud is not necessarily safe or under your control. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Risks with cloud storage are having your data hacked and deleted, being locked out of your account, or having it be closed if you make late payments. Also, these types of online services can suddenly shut down or otherwise cease to exist. </span></p>
<h2>A word about digital data</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem with digital data is that storage formats change over time. You might keep your photos &#8220;safe,&#8221; but they&#8217;ll be useless to you if you can&#8217;t read or open them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Operating systems, software and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-all-the-different-image-file-formats/">file formats</a> keep changing, so just because you can see a file on your computer doesn’t mean you can actually load it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One example is the attempts to replace the standard .jpg file format with JPEG 2000, PNG (Portable Network Graphics) and several others. JPG is fine for now, but you can never say never because this sort of thing actually happens all the time as technology changes.</span></p>
<h2>A word about disk drives</h2>
<p><span class="s2"><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/external-hard-drives-backing-up-and-saving-your-images/">Hard drives</a> are great for storing images because they are relatively inexpensive, they provide fast access to data, and it’s very easy to copy one hard drive to another. </span></p>
<p><span class="s2">However, backup drives are not an all-in-one perfect solution. Your data is at risk of being stolen or destroyed by fire, flood or some other disaster.</span></p>
<p>Also, the <span class="s2">data is vulnerable to malicious software and human error.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2">You can accidentally delete a folder, or make mistakes when copying files. If your PC is infected by malware, it will usually encrypt files on external hard drives as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I personally have had several hard drives fail. One time I had a hard drive and a laptop fail <em>at the same time!</em> Some hard drives fail after several years of use, while others fail after only a few months. There is no way of knowing when the case may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="s2">Therefore, you can&#8217;t store your photos on a single drive. A minimum of two is recommended. I have backups on a couple of 1TB external, portable hard drives, as well as on two 4TB hard drives that are plugged into my desktop computer. </span><span class="s2"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="s2">You should keep one of your backups off-site, like at a relative&#8217;s home or even in a bank safety deposit box. </span></p>

<h2>How to back up while shooting tethered</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html">Chronosync</a> is one backup software that I recommend you use while shooting tethered if you use a Mac. If you&#8217;re a PC user, check out <a href="https://bvckup2.com/">Bvckup.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodsync.com/platforms">Goodsync</a> can be used with either system.</p>
<p>This type of software allows you to look at a given folder and copy everything to another folder on a separate hard drive. For example, you might want to shoot images on your laptop and have them sync to an external portable hard drive. Or you may want to use two separate portable hard drives. Basically what you&#8217;re doing is telling it what folder to look at and make an exact duplicate of it to another drive.</p>
<p>You can set it on a schedule or have it running in the background. Setting it on a schedule is great if you always have a hard drive plugged into your laptop.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to do it with <strong>Chronosync</strong>.</p>
<p>1. Open up the application and choose, Create a New Synchronizer Document</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175818" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chronosync-Mac-1.jpg?resize=892%2C558&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Backup Your Photos While Shooting Tethered so You Never Lose Them" width="892" height="558" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chronosync-Mac-1.jpg?w=892&amp;ssl=1 892w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chronosync-Mac-1.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chronosync-Mac-1.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chronosync-Mac-1.jpg?resize=600%2C375&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chronosync-Mac-1.jpg?resize=717%2C449&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>2. Decide what drives you want to synchronize by selecting <strong>&gt;Choose</strong> from the <strong>Source Target</strong> and <strong>Destination Target</strong> menus accordingly. It will give you several choices of how you might want to back up from the dropdown menu under <strong>&gt;Operation.</strong><br />
My recommendation is that you choose <strong>&gt;Backup Synchronize Bidirectional</strong>. This will ensure that everything that is on one drive will also appear on the other.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175820" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Hard-Drive-Synchronization-Chronosync.jpg?resize=915%2C289&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Backup Your Photos While Shooting Tethered so You Never Lose Them" width="915" height="289" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Hard-Drive-Synchronization-Chronosync.jpg?w=915&amp;ssl=1 915w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Hard-Drive-Synchronization-Chronosync.jpg?resize=300%2C95&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Hard-Drive-Synchronization-Chronosync.jpg?resize=768%2C243&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Hard-Drive-Synchronization-Chronosync.jpg?resize=600%2C190&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Hard-Drive-Synchronization-Chronosync.jpg?resize=717%2C226&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>&gt;Synchronize</strong> in the top left-hand corner. It may take a few minutes for the synchronization to take place. Once it&#8217;s complete you&#8217;ll see the message below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175817" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Synchronization-Complete-Chronosync.jpg?resize=492%2C352&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Backup Your Photos While Shooting Tethered so You Never Lose Them" width="492" height="352" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Synchronization-Complete-Chronosync.jpg?w=492&amp;ssl=1 492w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Synchronization-Complete-Chronosync.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s as simple as that. With synchronization software like Chronosync, you&#8217;ll ensure that all your files and folders are backed up for a very low price.</p>
<h2>Other backup software</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many large companies offer photo storage services including Amazon, Google, Microsoft (OneDrive), and Apple (iCloud). However, this can be expensive if you need a lot of storage. With some, downloading large files is cumbersome and data such as file names and EXIF Data may not be preserved. Some services don&#8217;t preserve your photos as you uploaded them, and others just don&#8217;t work very well (Time Machine, I&#8217;m looking at you).</span></p>
<p>Here are some other paid-for options that are worth a look:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softobe.com/folderssynchronizer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FoldersSynchronizer</a> – a popular program for Mac OS which synchronizes backup files, folders, and disks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Duper</a> – great for disk backups on a Mac. It allows you to create a bootable clone of your disk which you can easily copy from one hard disk to another. This makes moving from one computer to another during an upgrade virtually painless.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smugmug.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smug Mug</a> – an all-in-one solution that allows photographers to display and sell their images, with unlimited uploads.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backblaze</a> – a cloud-based backup system that will continually back up your data while your computer is on. Use to restore data after a drive failure.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173966" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smug-Mug.jpg?resize=1500%2C763&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Backup Your Photos While Shooting Tethered so You Never Lose Them" width="1500" height="763" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smug-Mug.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smug-Mug.jpg?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smug-Mug.jpg?resize=768%2C391&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smug-Mug.jpg?resize=600%2C305&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smug-Mug.jpg?resize=717%2C365&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2>To sum up</h2>
<p>To ensure that you have all your bases covered when backing up your files, you should backup specific shoots as well as regularly do backups of your whole computer(s).</p>
<p>Have a couple of backups on hard drives, as well as a cloud-based backup.</p>
<p>When shooting tethered, I recommend backing up your images manually as you&#8217;re shooting, one at a time, to ensure that each image exists in at least two places at that time. Once you&#8217;re finished shooting, back up your portable hard drive to another one, preferably a larger, more robust hard drive where you store a copy of all your image folders.</p>

<p>I was loaned a Sigma sd Quattro H and the Sigma 14mm, 50mm, and 120-300mm lenses. I took the camera to Alaska, Washington, and California to test it in the real world.</p>

<h2>The big difference &#8211; a Foveon X3 Sensor</h2>
<p>Sigma has chosen a different beast of a sensor for its sd Quattro H camera; the Foveon X3. A graphic from Foveon&#8217;s site describes it best.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sigma-sd-quattro-h-review-0342.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-172963" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sigma-sd-quattro-h-review-0342.jpg?resize=495%2C210&#038;ssl=1" alt="The Sigma sd Quattro H Camera Review" width="495" height="210" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sigma-sd-quattro-h-review-0342.jpg?w=495&amp;ssl=1 495w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sigma-sd-quattro-h-review-0342.jpg?resize=300%2C127&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayer pattern</a> as most commercially available cameras use these days, the Foveon X3 captures each color, and luminosity information, at each pixel site. It accomplishes this because each wavelength of light is absorbed in different rates in a silicon chip.</p>
<p>Essentially, instead of having red, green and blue pixels side by side, the pixels are stacked on top of each other. This produces a sharper image overall. The overall brightness of the image is recorded on the top layer along with the blues. Here&#8217;s another way to look at it compared to the Bayer pattern.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/quattro_difference_image.gif?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-175319" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/quattro_difference_image.gif?resize=510%2C407&#038;ssl=1" alt="The Sigma sd Quattro H Camera Review" width="510" height="407" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The &#8216;H&#8217; in &#8216;sd Quattro H&#8217; represents the sensor size. It is not a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/camera-sensors-explained/">full-frame sensor nor is it APS-C</a>, it is in-between. The crop factor is 1.3x, still requiring a 40mm lens to equate to a typical 50mm lens on a full-frame sensor.</p>
<h2>The Quattro&#8217;s sweet spot &#8211; image quality</h2>
<p>Before we get to the downsides of the Sigma sd Quattro H, let&#8217;s cover what it does so very, very well; details.</p>
<p>No matter the lens (and I tested the camera with a Sigma 14mm, 50mm, and 120-300mm), the amount of detail you can pull out of images is fascinating. Image crispness is helped further by the sensor&#8217;s configuration, which does not suffer from moiré like other cameras with Bayer pattern sensors. I tried and tried to shoot and show some moiré, but it&#8217;s just not there.</p>

<p>Landscape and portrait photographers will love the amount of detail in every shot. Lack of moiré increase its apparent sharpness without compromise, also making it a quality platform for <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-pieces-of-architecture-photography-equipment-you-need/">architectural photographers</a>. Add in the ability to bracket with three or five frames (and ranges from 1/3stop to 3stops between those frames), and the patient photographer will find much joy with this setup.</p>
<p>Below are 100% crops, along with original images, to help you compare.</p>

<h2>The downsides</h2>
<p>Upon first using the Sigma camera, you will notice how slow it is. While this is not on purpose, it&#8217;s a side-effect of the massive amount of data the camera&#8217;s sensor creates. This large amount of data also drains batteries on the order of maybe 200 images shot per 1800 mAh battery (comparable to most DSLR batteries).</p>

<p>Sigma attempts to mitigate the slow processing with an eight-shot buffer and a continuous shooting speed of 4-8 frames per second depending on image size and format. This does a decent job of helping the camera keep up with moderate action. Make no mistake, this is not a sports photographer&#8217;s camera, but in a pinch, it can capture fast action.</p>
<p>The buffer is the same no matter the file format (see below for file sizes). Even in JPEG mode, you will get eight shots then have to wait about one second between shots for processing and buffer actions.</p>
<p>Auto-focus is also subpar and often seems to favor the contrast-detection aspect more than the phase-detection aspect of its hybrid focus system. There isn&#8217;t much hunting, but in low light, it does struggle more than I would like. I often found myself defaulting to manual focus when I knew the light was not ample.</p>
<p>However, the camera does have a Focus Peaking option which allows live view focusing with a digital zoom for accomplishing precision focus in manual focus mode.</p>
<p>The sensor has a dynamic range of slightly less than 10-stops, giving pause to those accustomed to the growing dynamic range of most modern DSLR cameras.</p>
<p>The camera also struggles with detail in black areas in the frame. It turns on its head the &#8220;<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/exposing-to-the-right-on-your-eos-camera/">Expose To The Right</a>&#8221; idea held by most DSLR photographers. An example below of a shot exposed to the right to as I would normally shoot it, along with a crop of the darker areas.</p>

<h2>File options</h2>
<p>In the past, Sigma cameras had two options: their proprietary 14-bit X3F format or JPEG. This meant either using Sigma&#8217;s Photo Pro software (currently on version 6) or outputting compressed JPEGS. You don&#8217;t spend money on a camera like this for the JPEGs, so it caused some consternation.</p>

<p>The sd Quatro H has a new option which helps open possibilities: DNG files. All of us using raw file editing programs can rejoice and not have to worry about conversions. However, the format has a lower bit depth than the .X3F format.</p>
<p>File sizes vary significantly from format to format. A typical JPEG file will be 10-15MB, JPEG super-fine setting (explained in a moment) 25-35MB, X3F will be 50-60MB, and DNG balloons to 120-150MB.  For a 64GB SDXC card, this nets about 3600 regular JPEG, 1800 super-fine JPEG, 630 X3F images and 410 DNG images, according to the back of the camera.</p>

<h2>Image Quality &#8211; Comparing X3F vs. DNG vs. JPEG Super Fine vs. JPEG Normal</h2>
<p>This next comparison is a bit tricky because we have to use Sigma&#8217;s Photo Pro to process and export the X3F file. I&#8217;m going to make all the original files <a href="https://assets.digital-photography-school.com/dpsstatic/Ferry_Boat_Files.zip">available here</a> (file download size: 210mb) so you can download them and compare without my need to export for web viewing.</p>
<p>There has always been controversy over how many pixels are reported on the Foveon sensors. Sigma says the images in X3F format have 39 megapixels, while the JPEG Superfine has 51 megapixels. Yet, the images that come out of the camera are 6192&#215;4128 or 25,560,576 pixels = 25.5MP. So what gives?</p>
<p>The X3F file contains 25.5MP of data on the top later that records the blue channel and the luminance information. The next two laters each capture 3096&#215;2064 or 6.39MP of information for red and green colors. Add those together and you get 25.5 + 6.39 + 6.39 = 38.28MP (I&#8217;ve done some rounding in this calculation).</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/quattro_solution_image.gif?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-175318" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/quattro_solution_image.gif?resize=490%2C337&#038;ssl=1" alt="The Sigma sd Quattro H Camera Review" width="490" height="337" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The X3F has more bit depth and thus more information. However, Sigma Photo Pro is not the most refined program in the world and takes some patience to use. You will get the most out of the camera if you can take it slow and edit in Photo Pro. With that said, the DNG files are excellent (if a bit inflated in MB) and can be edited easily in Lightroom and other programs compatible with the format.</p>
<p>Lastly, what about that Super Fine JPEG format? I have to admit; it&#8217;s tempting to lust after 51MP out of a mirrorless camera. Yet, the quality of those shots is juuuusstt off the mark for my liking. Let me give you some 100% crops for comparison. I didn&#8217;t include the X3F version because the Photo Pro software is not straightforward on how to perform a crop, even after consulting the manual.</p>

<p>For my liking, that last one has just a little too much pixelation when looked at up close.</p>
<h2>Shooting options</h2>
<p>The sd Quattro H has all the standard shooting modes you&#8217;d expect: Manual, Program (with program shift), <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-priority-and-shutter-priority-exposure-lesson-1/">Aperture Priority and Shutter Speed Priority</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-choose-the-right-iso-for-your-digital-photography/">ISO</a> is selectable between 100-6400, not quite the range we&#8217;re accustomed to with modern DSLR bodies. Further, noise becomes quite notable around ISO 800, making it difficult to get used to the higher ISO limits. It does have the ability to use Auto ISO and to limit the range, which I find useful.</p>

<p>While there are only nine focus points, arranged in a standard 3&#215;3 grid, Sigma does give you the capability to change the size of the focus points in three steps, with the larger size covering a decent 60% of the viewing area. You can also select individual points instead of using all nine. This combination allows for a fair amount of control for wide-open scenes down to a need to focus on an individual stamen on a flower.</p>

<h2>Useful features</h2>
<p>Sometimes my eyes don&#8217;t seem to see straight, so I found the onscreen level to be very handy. It can be turned off for those who don&#8217;t want it, but for the rest of us, it&#8217;s quite useful.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, the smaller LCD display on the back, highlighting exposure settings, battery level, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-exposure-compensation-to-take-control-of-your-exposure/">exposure compensation</a>, ISO, metering mode and shooting mode, is a welcome addition. Especially those using a tripod at eye height, which is when you have to stand on tiptoes to view the top display. Most of us glance at the rear display on our camera more than the front and this easy reference screen is handy. Controls for each of those items are located just to their right for easy, quick access.</p>

<p>As with other <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/nikon-dropping-1-3rd-of-its-dslr-lineup-in-move-to-mirrorless/">mirrorless cameras</a>, having the histogram displayed in the viewfinder is a boon, especially when the dynamic range of the camera is less than 10-stops. Keeping the exposure correct with a histogram to help analyze a scene is very useful.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>The Sigma sd Quattro H comes with two control wheels on the top of the camera. When shooting in Manual mode, the different dials, as expected, control shutter speed and aperture for easy shooting. The rear dial does not stand out too far and has just the right amount of tactile response when functioning. These functions can be switched around in the camera menu.</p>

<p>On the back of the camera are multi-directional buttons to assist in menu and control selection. They are well placed and easy to access without removing your eye from the viewfinder.</p>
<p>Also on the rear of the camera is a selector switch for using the viewfinder LCD or the rear camera monitor while shooting. I found the camera was often slow in switching from the rear monitor (on most of the time the camera shutter has been pressed halfway to activate auto-focus) to the viewfinder. This slight lag in switching became annoying in constant use and while quickly reviewing images on the rear screen before commencing further image acquisition.</p>

<p>The solution for me was to use the viewfinder only. However, this slowed down my process as only reviewing of images within the viewfinder is less than ideal. I wish the switching mechanism was quicker.</p>
<p>The camera also has controls for changing what information is displayed on the various screens, adjusting focus points and auto exposure/autofocus lock.</p>
<h2>Fit &amp; Feel</h2>
<p>Admittedly, the Quattro looks a little odd. It has a weird shape and the viewfinder seems to be in the wrong spot.</p>
<p>The grip is comfortable and makes all-day use easy. While not cupped in like some DSLR cameras, it has enough surface for a solid grip.</p>

<p>The viewfinder is off to the side to allow space for the hotshoe directly over the lens. This tripped me up more than a dozen times as I grabbed the camera, with its DSLR-like feel, and brought it up to my eye in the wrong location. Not a big deal, but it felt a little off at times. Those without a lot of DSLR experience will not notice anything amiss.</p>
<p>The camera feels solid like a quality DSLR while having less weight. It feels like a camera that can handle hard work for years to come.</p>
<h2>Menu control</h2>
<p>Before we get into the menus, the Quattro has a hand QS button on the top, just next to the shutter release. It brings up a Quick Selection menu (either in the viewfinder or back screen). This is where you&#8217;ll want to make most of your image quality and other changes. The menu options are selectable within the camera&#8217;s options menu.</p>
<p>You select the camera&#8217;s menu by pressing the obvious MENU button on the back of the camera. The top control wheels or the back multi-directional buttons control the menus. Menus are displayed in an over-down setup, much like Canon cameras.</p>
<p>There are six shooting menus, two review menus, and five setup menus.</p>

<h2>Do I have to use Sigma&#8217;s app?</h2>
<p>For those of you happily stuck in your ways with your favorite image processing workflow, the quick answer is &#8220;no.&#8221; Because of the sd Quattro H&#8217;s ability to produce <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/make-lightroom-faster-by-using-dng/">DNG files</a>, the world is your oyster when it comes to editing photos.</p>
<p>However, and this gets into the technical side of things, the DNG file has already had some processing done to it in its creation. There is evidence that the color balance of the original X3F file is easier to accomplish using Sigma&#8217;s PhotoPro software than working with the DNG file. This is because of the camera&#8217;s need to convert the information it collects from the sensor and craft a DNG file.</p>

<p>Sigma&#8217;s PhotoPro software has come a long way and will create better images for you than simply using the DNG file. Think of it this way; the DNG files are higher quality than the JPEG files, while the X3F files are higher than the DNG. Each step, from JPEG to DNG to X3F, allows for more latitude and control when processing your images.</p>
<p>My suggestion if you acquire this camera: take the time to learn Sigma PhotoPro if you want professional quality results.</p>

<h2>Hidden option: Easy Infrared</h2>
<p>One feature not often touted in Sigma&#8217;s literature or sales documents is its <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-do-surreal-digital-infrared-photography-without-expensive-gear-or-camera-conversions/">infrared</a> capabilities. This will undoubtedly appeal to various landscape photographers because of its ease of use.</p>
<p>I was not able to acquire one of the needed pieces to make this system work before I returned the camera, but I was able to test the removal of the infrared filter. It is located front and center on the lens mount when the end cap is removed. After you remove the filter, you need a visible light filter on the front of whichever lens you use.</p>
<p>The combination of removing one filter and adding another adds full infrared capability without an expensive conversion typical with DLSRs these days. The versatility this adds could make it a likely option for those wanting to dabble in infrared photography but not wanting to lug around a whole other camera for the purpose.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/dPSSigmaSDQuattroH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sigma sd Quattro H</a> camera is a mixed bag with a specific audience. They have made strides in shooting speed and buffering over time (the first iterations of their Foveon sensor cameras were quite slow, almost to the point of uselessness) and that has helped bring up overall usefulness.</p>
<p>If you are a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/11-surefire-tips-for-improving-your-landscape-photography/">landscape photographer</a> and take things slow, this is a great camera for incredible detail. <a href="https://resources.digital-photography-school.com/download/transcending-travel-50-off-book/">Travel photographers</a> will enjoy the camera (if they aren&#8217;t shooting a lot of fast action) for the lack of moiré in buildings and other patterns found while exploring. I can also see macro photographers gaining a lot from the details and Focus Peeking feature.</p>
<p>However, the speed of shooting and speed of auto-focus can hold this camera back for the average photographer. It can be a bit frustrating to wait for images to appear and battery life is less than most of its competitors.</p>

It was authored by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/author/jaymes-dempsey/">Jaymes Dempsey</a>.</p>
<p>Are you searching for a pocket-sized camera that packs a big punch?</p>
<p>Look no further than the just-announced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Premium-Compact-1-0-type-DSCRX100M7/dp/B07VPQV7BY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=sony+RX100+vii&amp;qid=1564528167&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMEFNUFlIRlU5VFVGJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTk3NDE5MUZBVjcxSE9KWFIxViZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTIyMDQyMktDTUNOQUZNM1FINyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=">Sony Cybershot RX100 VII</a>, which is an all-around amazing camera, from its small size to its impressive zoom to its powerful optics.</p>
<p>First, take a look at its lengthy <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/primes-versus-zoom-lenses/">zoom lens</a>, which goes from 24mm to 200mm in moments. This is perfect for capturing <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/improve-your-landscape-photography/">wider landscapes</a>, then zooming in to emphasize a few compelling details.</p>
<p>The Sony RX100 VII also promises stellar image quality, with a ZEISS lens and a 20.1-megapixel sensor.</p>
<p>But where the Sony RX100 VII really shines is in the<a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/8-tips-photographing-fast-action-sports/"> thick of the action</a>. The RX100 VII shoots at 20 frames-per-second, which is far faster than most competitors on the market. And the autofocus is especially notable, with 357 AF points.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-176085 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robot-photography-500.jpg?resize=1500%2C578&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sony-RX100-VII" width="1500" height="578" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robot-photography-500.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robot-photography-500.jpg?resize=300%2C116&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robot-photography-500.jpg?resize=768%2C296&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robot-photography-500.jpg?resize=600%2C231&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/robot-photography-500.jpg?resize=717%2C276&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve worked with mirrorless or DSLR cameras before, then you&#8217;ll appreciate the electronic viewfinder on the RX100 VII. This is useful for shooting in bright conditions, or when you&#8217;re struggling to see the (touchscreen!) LCD.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention the 4K video capabilities? If you want a camera that will get you good images and beautiful videos while remaining nicely compact, the RX100 VII may be the way to go.</p>
<h2>Who is the Sony RX100 VII for?</h2>
<p>The RX100 VII should appeal to a few groups of people.</p>
<p>First, the RX100 VII is a good camera for <a href="https://resources.digital-photography-school.com/download/nuts-bolts-course/">beginner photographers</a> looking to buy something a bit more long-term, but who doesn&#8217;t want to deal with the complexities or price of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p>
<p>And for those of you who have been using your <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/advantages-dslrs-have-over-smartphones/">smartphones</a> as a primary camera, the RX100 VII will take your photos up a notch – without requiring much in the way of advanced settings or know-how.</p>
<p>Finally, the Sony RX100 VII is ideal for more serious photographers who want a second, more portable camera body. If you often get frustrated carrying around a DSLR or mirrorless camera/lens combo while traveling, then the Sony RX100 VII may be exactly what you need.</p>

<h2>Apples, oranges, and bananas</h2>
<p>Yes, they are all fruits, all are natural, and they all taste sweet, but there are differences between each that appeal to different pallets. When comparing these three alternative post-processing applications to the revered Adobe offerings of Photoshop, Lightroom, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-adobe-camera-raw-and-photoshop-to-make-your-landscape-images-pop/">Camera RAW</a>, the differences are as noticeable as the similarities.</p>
<h2>A little background</h2>
<p>When it all began, Photoshop offered digital photographers a simple collection of imaging tools that allowed them to adjust the colors, tones, and sharpness of their pictures. It was all nice and simple.</p>
<p>However, that simplicity got more complicated.</p>
<p>The ’90s was an era that awakened a new generation of photographers. The taste of blood was in the public waters, and it attracted all forms of predators. As users became more sophisticated, demanding more power and software magic, Silicon Valley awoke to the smell of profits. Computer technology companies sprung up everywhere, developing new and faster processors, higher resolution monitors and larger storage devices.</p>
<p>The door to the digital darkroom swung wide open, and the Adobe marketing machine began rolling out yearly updates for their breakthrough photo editing software. Cha-Ching.</p>
<p>Adobe not only started a new industry – they owned it. For the first ten years or so, Adobe wisely kept any imaging software challengers at bay by enlisting them to develop supporting software (called plugins) that added functionality to Photoshop without challenging its command directly. Dozens of very cleaver plug-in technology companies were welcomed to demonstrate their products (and their allegiance) to Adobe within their mammoth booth at all the trade shows.</p>
<p>Adobe Systems became a very extended family and quickly established themselves as the Goliath that nobody dared to provoke.</p>
<div id="attachment_175670" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175670" class="size-full wp-image-175670" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?resize=1500%2C1004&#038;ssl=1" alt="Image: Adobe booth at MacWorld show in San Francisco." width="1500" height="1004" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?resize=768%2C514&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?resize=600%2C402&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?resize=436%2C293&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MacworldFloor-Adobe.jpg?resize=717%2C480&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-175670" class="wp-caption-text">Adobe booth at MacWorld show in San Francisco.</p></div>
<p>The Adobe scientists invested in the digital camera manufacturers and Silicon Valley chip wizards. Every year these developers delivered smaller and more powerful image sensors and processors able to capture and deliver incredible levels of detail from digital camera images. Adobe introduced a powerful plug-in package of their own called Camera Raw, able to mine and manipulate the vast amounts of RAW data captured by the sensors.</p>
<div id="attachment_175671" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175671" class="size-full wp-image-175671" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Panasonic-Lumix-7.jpg?resize=1500%2C569&#038;ssl=1" alt="Image: Early Panasonic PV-SD4090 PalmCam digital camera and Panasonic Lumix DMC-G7 4K Mirrorless, 20..." width="1500" height="569" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Panasonic-Lumix-7.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Panasonic-Lumix-7.jpg?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Panasonic-Lumix-7.jpg?resize=768%2C291&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Panasonic-Lumix-7.jpg?resize=600%2C228&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Panasonic-Lumix-7.jpg?resize=717%2C272&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-175671" class="wp-caption-text">Early Panasonic PV-SD4090 PalmCam digital camera and Panasonic Lumix DMC-G7 4K Mirrorless, 2018.</p></div>
<p>When first introduced, digital cameras were only able to capture 256 levels (8-bits) of color. However, the sensors and processors for the new generation of cameras upped the ante by delivering up to 4 trillion (14-bits) color.</p>
<p>The Photoshop dreadnaught continued to grow and dominate the market. For that first decade, Photoshop was not only the digital imaging Sheriff – it was the law!</p>
<p>However, as it happens with many other products, Photoshop eventually became so gorged with various tools and appliances intended to address every need of photographers and artists, that it began to resemble a cramped and crowded commercial kitchen; pots, pans, and ladles hanging from every conceivable hook. The once swift, svelte and powerful software buckled under its own excesses, eventually being tagged by one industry pundit as bloatware.</p>
<p>But nobody has ever accused Goliath of being either daft or deaf. Adobe listened and learned from its more sophisticated photographer base who demanded a software package streamlined and focused specifically on the professional user. This new software would include filing and database features allowing professional photographers to catalog, label, sort, and shape their images in one arena, and free of most of the fluffy and artsy features of Photoshop. Adobe crowned this new pro-focused software Lightroom. Pretty cleaver… Photo Shop and Light Room. Hmm-m.</p>

<h2>Goliath and the David class</h2>
<p>All this time, quietly in the background, several talented Photoshop plug-in developers were busy developing their own image-altering software. Software consisting of mostly specialty filters and visual effects tools that worked within both Photoshop and Lightroom as plug-ins. In addition, they operated as standalone software editing applications.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, a silent revolution existed that would someday rise up and directly challenge Goliath. These same “deep-bit” RAW processing tools once only available in Camera Raw and Lightroom were now available from these independent developers who had quietly amassed millions of faithful followers. The “David” class of software emerged, with the battle lines now drawn. Goliath had some worthy opponents to contend with and some new battles to fight.</p>
<p>Many of the software developers in this “David class” were long-term seasoned veterans in the image editing field with their own stable of brilliant young engineers. They had initially opened their doors for business in the early nineties, just a couple of years after the introduction of Photoshop.</p>
<p>These companies included Extensis, Alien Skin, and Phase One Camera Systems. My own software company, ImageXpress, introduced our Scanprep plug-in product in 1993, so I have known and respected these companies for over twenty-five years. They each offer unique products and have earned long and distinguished records in the industry.</p>

<h3>Extensis, Alienskin and Eye Candy</h3>
<p>Extensis, founded in Portland, Oregon in 1993, offered several products, including Intellihance. At that time, Craig Keudell was the company’s VP of Sales and Operations and would later become President. Originally developed as a plug-in for Photoshop, Intellihance offered simple image corrections.</p>
<p>Craig went on to found ON1, Inc in 2005. ON1 is the developer of Photo RAW 2019, a dead-serious Lightroom contender sporting a powerful Raw processor, image editor, and DAM (digital asset management) system.</p>
<p>Alien Skin Software was also founded in 1993 by Jeff Butterworth (joined soon thereafter by Finley Lee), on the other side of the country in Raleigh, North Carolina. This company’s first software product was called Eye Candy, an image interpreter that gave users the ability to produce attractive (and sometimes bazaar) special effects from digital images. Alien Skin’s current flagship software, Exposure X4.5, provides RAW processing, image editing, and a nearly exhaustive collection of pre-set filters. These filters simulate the look of just about every film-age photo paper, film emulsion, and toning process.</p>

<h3>Phase One &#8211; Capture One 12</h3>
<p>Phase One Camera A/S is a Danish company founded that very same year (1993). It produced a unique medium format digital camera system for the professional market. The Copenhagen-based camera manufacturer’s latest hardware offering is the XF IQ4 Camera System, now in its fourth generation. Phase One’s precision camera systems require a very sophisticated software product to exploit the massive amounts of spectral data delivered by their cameras.</p>
<p>In 2003, Capture One software first began to support 35mm DSLR cameras from third-party manufacturers such as Canon, Nikon, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-fujifilm-x-series-kits-for-travel-photography/">Fuji</a>. The software now supports 500+ cameras. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/capture-one-pro-switch/">Capture One 12</a> is the current version of this advanced editing software.</p>
<h2>Products and uses</h2>
<p>Most users of Lightroom operate the software for similar reasons – <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/find-your-photos-lightroom-catalog-using-filters/">cataloging</a>, organizing, and the basic editing of digital images. In that respect, all of the challengers offer similar services and features.</p>
<p>But not all users have the same needs with their software.</p>
<p>Digital photographers come in all sizes with diverse desires. Many users don’t get beyond the simple primping stages of brightening, straitening, and cleaning up their images – the basic processes that all began thirty years ago with Photoshop. Others are either professional photographers or dead-serious enthusiasts who utilize very advanced features of the software.</p>
<p>With the variety of software available in this field, there is something for everyone.</p>
<h2>The Adobe alternatives</h2>
<p>Just as these original three “David class” developers focused on different areas of the imaging industry with their initial products back in the ‘90s, each of their current products has established turf in today’s market. While offering the same basic editing and non-destructive RAW adjustment tools as Camera Raw and Lightroom, each product maintains its own personality.</p>
<p>There are similarities with these post-processing applications in the initial “sliders” appearance and the operation of each application, but beyond the basic tonal and color adjustments, the individual strengths become more evident.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs and personal preference, you may find that one of these products appeal to you and draw you away from your Adobe subscription addiction.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the strengths and personalities of the software products.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-175675 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/On1-Logo.jpg?resize=1500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="alternative-post-processing-applications-3" width="1500" height="281" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/On1-Logo.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/On1-Logo.jpg?resize=300%2C56&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/On1-Logo.jpg?resize=768%2C144&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/On1-Logo.jpg?resize=600%2C112&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/On1-Logo.jpg?resize=717%2C134&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>ON1 Photo RAW 2019.5</h3>
<p>Purchase price $100 (upgrade from the previous version: $80)</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/on1-photo-raw-2019-review/">ON1 Photo RAW 2019.5</a> will give you the features photographers use the most from the Lightroom and Photoshop worlds in a single application. With Photo RAW, you can quickly browse, organize, manage, and catalog photos in your photo editing workflow. The ultra-fast photo browser and organizer are perfect for rapidly viewing and culling through photos without waiting on previews to generate or an import process.</p>
<p>Importing images is not necessary with Photo RAW. You don’t create libraries or catalogs with this software. Instead, you view the images where they reside on your computer. If you want easy access to specific images within specific folders, use the indexing feature. Indexing these folders in Photo RAW keeps track of all thumbnails in each folder. Photo RAW actually moves the image files to a folder that you specify.</p>
<p>Photo RAW key features: HDR, Noise Reduction, Versions (Virtual Copies), Photo Stitching (Merge to Panorama), Keywords, Tethered Shooting, Portrait Retouching, and Layers.</p>
<p>With the addition of layers, ON1 ups the ante by allowing you to blend, mask, replace backgrounds, and more. ON1 Photo RAW also provides 27 unique filters, LUTs, and textures, delivering ample interpretations of each image.</p>
<p>ON1 also includes a Lightroom Migration assistant that utilizes AI-powered algorithms to transfer Lightroom edited photos, keep the non-destructive settings, and move them into ON1 Photo RAW.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-175676 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Exposure-X4-Logo.jpg?resize=1500%2C266&#038;ssl=1" alt="alternative-post-processing-applications-4" width="1500" height="266" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Exposure-X4-Logo.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Exposure-X4-Logo.jpg?resize=300%2C53&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Exposure-X4-Logo.jpg?resize=768%2C136&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Exposure-X4-Logo.jpg?resize=600%2C106&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Exposure-X4-Logo.jpg?resize=717%2C127&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h3>Alien Skin Exposure X4.5</h3>
<p>Purchase price: $119, (upgrade from previous versions $79-$89), and bundled with Blow up and Snap Art for $149.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/review-alien-skin-exposure-x4-software/">Exposure X4.5</a> offers powerful organizing tools, fast performance, an intuitive design, and a subscription-free approach. With this one piece of software, you can handle all your photo editing work. Exposure X4.5 is best known for its selection of beautiful customizable presets, which span the entire history of film and beyond.</p>
<p>With Exposure X4.5, you choose the image folders you want to organize by adding them as “bookmarks.” Once a folder is ‘bookmarked,’ you can browse the subfolders as indexed and cataloged folders, searching for photos using keywords or image metadata.</p>
<p>Exposure X4.5 key features: Extensive browsing, search, and cataloguing tools (Smart Collections and Bookmarks), Light Effects and Textures, analog film effects, ample LUTs (lookup tables for instant tone and color shifts), Virtual Copies, sophisticated Bokeh effects, transform tools to straighten and correct perspective shots and watched folders.</p>

<h3>Phase One Camera Systems Capture One 12.03</h3>
<p>Perpetual license: $299, subscription $15/mo.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/capture-one-pro-12-review/">Capture One</a> offers a lot of everything for just about every level of interest. Delving into its inner workings allows one to tinker with color on a near-molecular level. While it is not a particularly intuitive tool for the beginner, it is a pure delight for those who want infinite control over their adjustments. New users can go to learn.captureone.com to get started. Capture One offers a very logical and exhaustive array of tools and controls, leaving little need for a wishlist. The learning curve is steep, but the control provided is nearly exhaustive.</p>
<p>Capture One offers two ways to access and file images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Catalog – a full DAM (digital asset management) system which works very similar to Lightroom, and</li>
<li>Session – a per project-based image access process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Session choice works by clicking on the small folder icon in the upper left-hand part of the original open window and accessing a very simple Mac/finder-type search dialogue. You indicate your image folder and then view the images inside that folder stacked vertically on the right-hand side of the Capture One window. Double-click an image and start working.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/retouch-images-using-capture-one/">Capture One</a> key features: Near-infinite masking tools for Basic, Advanced, and Skin Tone colors, including Hue, Saturation, Lightness, and Smoothness (feathered edges), Color Balance for Highlight, Midtone, Shadow, 3-Way (overall), color channel controlled B/W conversions, Layers (up to 16, each with individual chroma/luma range assignments), and dynamic Histogram readouts that track every adjustment.</p>
<p>Capture One’s extensive masking tools provide unparalleled control over both color and tonal shape with each mask creating its own layer. The variety of masks include Luminosity, Linear Gradient, and Radial Gradients. Each mask is infinitely adjustable and can be tweaked and finessed at any time. You can also purchase additional Styles Packs (essentially, presets that don’t alter the exposure or white balance).</p>

Each of the software packages mentioned herein is capable of delivering just that. I’ll leave it to you to predict which software I chose to rescue and produce this example.</p></div>
<h2><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>I’ve made no attempt to declare a winner in this article, but most assuredly these alternative post-processing applications are very valid and capable challengers to the Adobe dynasty.</p>
<p>You certainly owe it to yourself to download a trial to each one of these packages and experiment with the possibilities. The alternatives are both diverse and similar in their offerings.</p>
<p>Each of these three packages requires a bit of habit remapping, and you should afford the time needed to draw your conclusions. Your personal requirements and tastes will ultimately deliver your answer.</p>
<p>I should note that no one piece of software; neither the Adobe family nor the challengers, provides a single comprehensive solution for all needs. Whichever addresses your particular needs best will become the backbone of your post-production work.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, I own (and use) all of these alternative post-processing applications.</p>
<p>Have you used these any of these alternative post-processing applications? What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>On the surface, poetry and photography may seem like completely different mediums. One deals with the written word, whereas the other creates images. But as two forms of artistic expression, poetry and photo-making have more in common than one might think. For example, both <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-journal-writing-improves-your-photography/">writing</a> and photography rely on narrative and visual language to operate. Light and space are illuminating factors in both mediums too. Investigating these shared attributes (and many more) can affect our photographic practice. Let&#8217;s look at a few ways in which poetry and photography are alike and how the poetic word can impact your approach to image-making.</p>

<h2>A poem without words</h2>
<p>The idea that written language conveys something more than just meaningless scribbles dates back to at least 3500 B.C. However, it was an ancient Roman poet by the name of Quintus Horatius Flaccus (known as Horace) who said that &#8220;a picture is a poem without words&#8221;.</p>
<p>Poets deconstruct images to form cohesive perspectives. As viewers, we <em>read</em> an image as we would written language, piecing information together to determine a picture as a whole. Through the <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/compose-photos-impact-using-elements-design/">elements</a> and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/">principals</a> of composition and design, a photographer works in verse, weaving impressions and notions that awaken under the eye of the viewer.</p>
<p>With the careful cultivation of detail, both photographers and poets gain a better appreciation for qualities like color, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-repetition-and-patterns-in-photography/">pattern</a>, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-for-shooting-for-graphic-textures/">texture,</a> <a href="https://expertphotography.com/line-shape-and-form-photography-composition/">shape and form.</a> By being deliberately attentive to aspects like light, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/use-rhythm-pattern-create-stronger-compositions/">rhythm</a>, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/telling-stories-with-photos/">narrative</a>, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/adding-emotion-and-feeling-to-photographs/">emotion</a>, (aspects that are of great importance to both poetry and photography), we can actualize Horace&#8217;s observation with deeper, more metered imagery made up of layers of meaning and emotional range.</p>

<h2>Creating a <em>little picture</em></h2>
<p>While he is best known for his novels <em>The Dharma Bums</em> and <em>On The Road, </em>Jack Kerouac was also an avid writer of westernized haiku. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">haiku</a>, a style of poetry originating in Japan, is a small poem traditionally based around images of the natural world.</p>
<p>Kerouac stated that Western haiku &#8220;must be very simple and free of all poetic trickery and make a little picture&#8230;&#8221;.  His statement likens the haiku to that of the photograph, encapsulating a moment in time.</p>
<p>Some examples of Kerouac&#8217;s haiku include;</p>
<p>The taste<br />
of rain &#8211;<br />
Why kneel?</p>
<p>Morning sun &#8211;<br />
The purple petals,<br />
Four have fallen</p>
<p>April mist –<br />
Under the pine<br />
At midnight</p>
<p>As a poem limited to three lines, only the most necessary information may be included in a successful haiku. This approach is not dissimilar to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-guidelines-minimalist-photography-improve-work/">minimalist photography</a>, where select aspects of a photograph are emphasized by the minimization or eradication of others.</p>
<p>Kerouac&#8217;s comparison between the haiku and a picture paints the photographer as a sculptor of imagery. By sacrificing superfluous details and conveying a very specific idea, both photographers and poets appeal to an audience with an efficacy that leaves the lasting impression of well-executed artwork.</p>

<h2>A change in perspective</h2>
<p>Both the poet and the photographer study a subject through many lenses. As an example, here are two poems of Wallace Steven&#8217;s <em>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird;</em></p>
<p>I<br />
Among twenty snowy mountains<br />
The only moving thing<br />
Was the eye of the blackbird</p>
<p>IX<br />
When the blackbird flew out of sight<br />
It marked the edge<br />
Of one of many circles</p>
<p>These two ways of seeing reflect how perspective is malleable, shaped by individual experience and thought. The gaze of the photographer and that of the poet are both analytical, yet individual. And just as there are many ways to approach single subject poetically, there are as many ways to approach the same subject photographically.</p>
<p>Researching other photography can be useful in gaining insight into how to attempt a subject. Interestingly, having a look at a poetic perspective can prove to be a useful insight in the same way. Studying the observations of poets can help draw out unique approaches to an environment or scenario, revealing useful opportunities and perspectives.</p>

<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>Both poetry and photography have the ability to <em>zoom in</em> and isolate, re-framing a subject and transforming it into something of significance or beauty. Take this excerpt from <em>The Wasteland</em> by T.S. Eliot;</p>
<p>Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br />
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,<br />
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends<br />
Or other testimony of summer nights.</p>
<p>T.S. Eliot paints a story through the listing of refuse that is often found in rivers. By focusing his literary lens on inanimate objects that hinge on human intervention, T.S. Eliot forges strong images in the mind, relating to the reader through simple and concise language. The more the writer lists, the clearer the picture of the water becomes. Yet at the same time, in a separate image, the viewer forms impressions of pollution and waste, an alternative landscape to that which the poet describes.</p>
<p>Poetry gives seemingly mundane subject matter a new significance. This same phenomenon occurs in photography. Under the scrutiny of the camera, a subject takes on a transformation. Through the act of photography, a subject is separated and elevated from the day-to-day, isolating a moment in time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174947" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photography_poetry_leaf.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How Poetry and Photography are Alike and How it Can Impact Your Photography" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photography_poetry_leaf.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photography_poetry_leaf.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photography_poetry_leaf.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photography_poetry_leaf.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photography_poetry_leaf.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photography_poetry_leaf.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The fact is that neither poetry nor photography is a complete reality. No art form is. Yet just as a photograph is a painting of light, the poem is a painting of words, and the experiences of both the photographer and the poet are entwined in their intention to express a version of reality that is both shared and unique.</p>

<h2>Avoiding photographing people</h2>
<p>My dad had a lovely Zeiss camera. The kind with bellows that folded up into a compact unit. It took 120 roll film. I used this camera to photograph my brother’s <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/guide-to-posing-bands-in-photography/">band</a>, playing an outdoor gig when I was 17. These 12 exposures filled my first roll of film.</p>
<p>Photography became my passion. Having a camera in my hand excited me and taught me to view the world around me in new ways. I would visualize and compose photos in my imagination even when I didn’t have my camera with me.</p>
<p>I photographed old rusty things, beaches, skies, mountains, and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-photographing-flowers/">flowers</a>, among other subjects – but never people.</p>

<p>People were well outside of my comfort zone – especially strangers.</p>

<h2>Dealing with that uncomfortable feeling</h2>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to impose on others.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the most common reason I hear from photographers about why they don&#8217;t photograph people.</p>
<p>Overcoming the fear of imposing, and settling the butterflies in your stomach is possible. Focused effort is required, but the results are well worth it.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Ultimate Guide is to teach you practical methods for photographing people, no matter how shy you are.</p>
<p>Photography is so much more than choosing the best lens and <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/best-camera-settings-portrait-photography/">camera settings</a>. Connecting with your subject is vital, particularly when you&#8217;re photographing people. If this is challenging for you, digging deep is essential – deep into your feelings of fear that invade your mind when you want to make a portrait.</p>
<p>Concentrate on the positive. Focus in on what&#8217;s attracted you. Why do you want to make that person&#8217;s portrait? Before you even approach someone or put your camera to your eye, clear your mind of doubt. Settle your thoughts and have a positive attitude towards what you are doing. Training your mind to think like this you will in time be able to control the feelings of self-doubt and fear of imposing.</p>
<p>Learn to recognize your negative thoughts that disrupt your intentions. Jump on them fast. The more consistently you can do this, the more successful you will be.</p>
<p>Only entertain your positive thoughts. As you do, your actions become automatic and relaxed. You will find it&#8217;s not stressful to approach people and to photograph them.</p>
<p>The more you do anything, the easier it becomes.</p>
<p>Practice training your mind to replace the fear of imposing with positive thoughts. Think about having a pleasant interaction with your subject. Reinforce your initial ideas of why you&#8217;ve chosen to photograph them. Let your mind fill with the intent to succeed.</p>
<p>Make yourself concentrate on the photo you are planning to make. Zone in on your composition, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-tips-fix-bad-lighting/">lighting</a>, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/">exposure</a>, and timing. When you do this, the rest of the world disappears for a while. Be in your own creative space in your head and heart, and nothing else will matter.</p>
<p>This may sound a little abstract and not what you&#8217;re used to reading in a photography article, but I assure you, as you focus your mind and practice these techniques, you will become a better photographer.</p>

<h2>Start with your camera</h2>
<p>Knowing how to use your camera with confidence is your first step. If you’re not comfortable using your camera you’re not likely to enjoy photographing people.</p>
<p>Use your camera <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/jumpstart-photography-start-365-project/">every day</a>. Make a habit of taking at least one or two photos a day. You’ll find it’s addictive in the very best ways. Having a creative release is good for your soul. Your creative imagination will develop as you use it. The more you practice, the more your artistic style will begin to emerge.</p>
<p>Frequent contact is key. Have your camera in your hands at least once a day. You will become intimate with it. Your fingers and thumbs will feel the shapes of the dials and buttons. You will develop your subconscious memory of where each control is. As you learned fast enough where the on/off switch is, you’ll be able to find all the essential camera controls before long.</p>
<p>Pick a time each day to use your camera. I am sure if you think about it you will fit in ten or twenty minutes to be creative. Perhaps when you commute to work or school, during your lunch break or before dinner. Making it the same time each day helps you to form this good habit. Routine, especially at first, is helpful. I know if you work at this, by the end of the first month you will have a good foundation to build on. You will have developed a positive new habit. Moreover, you will see the quality of your photography improve.</p>
<p>The subject matter is not as relevant at first. Don’t even think about photographing people. Your goal in taking photos every day is to learn to love your camera and use it with confidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-joy-of-photography-experimentation/">Experiment.</a> Imagine. Express what you see. This will become a natural time of learning and growth. Sometimes you may feel frustrated at not being able to create the image that’s in your head. This is the time to learn more about controlling your camera so you can make it do what you want it to. Use various lens focal lengths. Choose different angles and composition techniques.</p>
<p>Combining some photography study often will result in more rapid growth. There are so many books, magazines, websites, and courses you can learn from. Find a way of learning that you’re comfortable with and set to study a little and often.</p>

Imagine. Express what you see. © Kevin Landwer-Johan</p></div>
<h2>Now focus on your subject</h2>
<p>Building proficiency using your camera will often prepare you to photograph <a href="https://resources.digital-photography-school.com/download/portraits-book/">people</a>. You need to be comfortable and confident you have the settings right.</p>
<p>Concentrating on your camera more than your subject is a common mistake. It’s easy to be distracted by your camera, especially for shy people. Not engaging with someone when you want to make their portrait leads to a disconnect. This is often noticeable in the resulting portrait.</p>
<p>You don’t want to leave the person looking at the top of your head as you peer down at your camera as you make adjustments.</p>
<p>Set your camera as much as possible before you engage with your subject. Then you will be giving them your attention without distraction. Don’t make your camera an excuse not to communicate. It’s not there to shield you from the world. Use it as a bridge to help you connect with your subjects.</p>

<h2>How to overcome your insecurities</h2>
<blockquote><p>“One of the easiest ways to overcome shyness is to become a photographer.” – David Hurn, photographer</p></blockquote>
<p>Years ago, I heard an interview with a photographer saying they thought shy people make the best portrait photographers. This was because the resulting photo will be more about the subject than about the photographer. As a shy person who liked photography, this interested me. It challenged me.</p>
<p>British photographer, David Hurn, talks about being shy in this interview with Huck magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m incredibly shy. Photography is the best thing for shy people because you have something to hide behind. The problem with shy people is that you don’t want to be rejected. So your safeguard is that you go into yourself. But with a camera, you have an excuse to be somewhere. So when you’re walking down the street and looking in a doorway at a whole load of people, being tattooed or something, with a camera, you can walk in and suddenly say, ‘Do you mind if I shoot some pictures?’ And if you show a genuine interest in what people are doing, I have never known anyone to say no. People love you being interested in them. The camera gives you that excuse to be there. It breaks through that barrier.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/photography-2/david-hurn-magnum-advice/">https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/photography-2/david-hurn-magnum-advice/</a></p>
<p>Why do you think David Hurn never had anyone say no to him? I believe it’s because of his approach. He has determination and a gentle manner.</p>
<p>He knows what he wants to achieve and the photos he wants to capture. Concentrating on his goal, he uses the camera as his reason to step into people’s situations, and into their lives. He is sure about what he wants, and he works with focused confidence to do it.</p>
<p>Having purpose will push you further, faster, in anything you want to achieve in life. It is no different for photography. If you have a well-defined purpose for what you want to accomplish, it can become a reality. If you drift about without direction, it takes a long time to achieve anything.</p>

<h2>Take your time</h2>
<p>Taking your time is not a bad thing. If you&#8217;re worried you will miss the photo, it means you haven&#8217;t started your preparation soon enough. Every genre of photography requires patience and anticipation. The better you know your camera, the faster you&#8217;ll have it set and ready in any circumstance. Take time to learn <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/">manual mode</a>. This will not only give you more control of your exposures, but it will also help you see life at a different pace.</p>
<p>It is true that automatic settings on your camera can help you take photos faster. You may be able to capture the action, but not the mood. Slow down and take notice of more than your camera settings. This is how you will learn to capture atmosphere.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think you always have to be fast with your camera. Doing so can be a distraction from truly experiencing photography.</p>
<p>Some of the best <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tutorial-easy-camera-settings-street-photography/">street photography</a> appears to have happened in a snap, but this is rarely so. Planning and preparation. Choice of light and location. Waiting. These qualities factor into more great street photos than sheer speed. Those fleeting moments when all the elements align in the viewfinder are anticipated.</p>

<h2>Your camera will help overcome your reluctance</h2>
<p>Your camera is your bridge to the other side of shyness. It allows you to traverse the distance between your intention to photograph someone and the actual portrait. It not only makes the picture, but it connects you with your subject.</p>
<p>Speaking to a stranger for no particular reason is very difficult for many people. Having a camera in your hands is a wonderful reason to speak with someone. Your camera is the solution to your problem of not wanting to approach people. When you come to realize this and learn to use your camera as a bridge, you will cross over into a whole new world of wonderful, creative experience.</p>
<p>Photographing people when your mind is focused on them, and not on your camera, transforms the experience.</p>
<p>My camera gets me to the other side, away from my insecure thoughts and into a conversation with the person. It is a reason for me to be where I am and to start conversations.</p>
<p>Use your camera as a means to introduce yourself and begin an interesting discussion. Don’t hide behind your camera fiddling with its controls. Be prepared and bold with it. Your camera will fulfill your purpose.</p>
<p>Express your intention to take a photograph with an appropriate amount of confidence. Doing this will open the way for you. Focus on your subject and their response to you.</p>
<p>When you approach someone in a self-assured way, it will be evident. If you appear to be unsure of yourself, your subject will often reflect this behavior back to you.</p>
<p>Self-assured communication with your subjects is important. It is as necessary as being confident with the technical aspects of photography.</p>

<h2>Choose who you want to photograph based on how receptive they will be</h2>
<p>Stepping into the street to photograph strangers for the first time is a daunting prospect.  It is not something many people find particularly easy. Don’t start there. Begin photographing someone you know and who appreciates what you are doing.</p>
<p>Friends or family members can be your best option. Someone you know and who enjoys having their photograph taken. People who like seeing their image are always the easiest to make portraits of. They are relaxed in front of the camera and are more likely to give you expressive feedback on your photos.</p>
<p>Finding someone you can photograph on a number of different occasions will help you learn. You will connect with them more each time you meet for a photo session. As you grow in confidence using your camera, you will find it becomes more natural to connect with people.</p>
<p>Take your camera to social gatherings – birthdays and other celebrations. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-a-wedding-a-guide-to-equipment-shooting-editing-and-more/">Weddings</a>, graduations, parties, church barbecues or the pub. Whatever social activities you engage in. Over time, you will begin to get more of a feel for the people who are easy to photograph.</p>
<p>Take your time. Make a start. Remain determined and practice as often as you can. Repetition will build your camera and your communication skills.</p>
<p>As you practice, be aware of how you are connecting, and the types of response people give you. Learn to read and understand the social dynamic having your camera in hand creates. Naturally, people will respond to you differently than if you are only having a conversation. Developing your perception of people’s reactions to your camera will help you when you come to photograph strangers.</p>

<h2>Communicate well</h2>
<p>Communicating your desire to photograph someone in an apt manner is imperative. This is a point of failure for many people. I cringe when I hear photographers speak inappropriately to the people they are photographing. Your portrait depends so much on the relationship you have with your subject. Even if that relationship only lasts a minute or two.</p>
<p>Being pleasant is vital to becoming a good people photographer – particularly if you want to become a wedding and <a href="https://resources.digital-photography-school.com/download/posing-book/">portrait photographer</a>. The way you communicate, your manner, and even your body language are important. Your clients notice these things. If they are comfortable with you, they respond well. Their body language and facial expressions will reflect this back to you.</p>
<p>Your manner of <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/communication-what-are-you-saying/">communication</a> depends on your state of mind. When you are worried about camera settings and the lighting, you are not so likely to communicate best. Put the technical thoughts aside before you start to engage with the people you want to photograph.</p>
<p>People love it when you show an interest in who they are and what they love to do. Genuine curiosity is natural in photographers, and you are best to develop this as much as you can. Make this aspect of your shyness work for you. Being keen, but yet a little reserved will endear you to people much more than being too bold will.</p>

<h2>Develop your camera skills with a project</h2>
<p>Once you commit to a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/25-practical-photography-projects/">photography project</a>, you have a theme or concept to work on. Sticking to your chosen topic and building a body of photographs allows you to track your development. Choosing to photograph a people project helps you build your confidence too.</p>
<p>Working on a long term project, you will experiment more with your camera and photography techniques. Push the boundaries and explore camera settings you don’t often use. This will allow you to produce a more diverse and interesting series of photographs.</p>
<p>As you build up a collection of images, you’ll be able to review and compare them. This will identify the skills you need to work on. It will also encourage you to see the areas where you are improving.</p>
<p>Over time, you will build up a significant collection of photos, both good and bad. Mostly bad. Don’t beat yourself up about this. It happens to every photographer. The more bad photos you take, the more good ones you will also create. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/you-are-your-own-best-teacher-learning-from-your-photography-mistakes/">Scrutinizing your photos</a> over an extended period allows you to chart your progress.</p>
<p>Keep everything. Do not delete images in camera. The key is <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/portrait-post-processing-workflow-tips/">being organized</a>. If you dump them all in a folder on your computer, this will not help. You’ll not be able to discern the nature of your progress.</p>
<p>Each time you work on your project, load the photos onto your computer and separate the top 10%-20% of the photos – the ones you are most happy with. Then separate into another folder, the ones you recognize as having potential and that you’d like to work on. Making notes for yourself during this process will help keep you on track and make it more beneficial.</p>
<p>Reviewing and comparing your photos like this can be challenging. You need to acknowledge the areas of weakness. Your photos will show you this. Having a more experienced photographer, someone who can mentor you through this process will be a huge advantage. They will be able to point out to you aspects of your work you may not be able to see so clearly.</p>

<h2>Develop your relational skills</h2>
<p>As you spend time with the same people, the relationship develops. Committing to a photography project involving the same people, you will build a closer relationship. This is true if you are photographing a family member or people at your local market.</p>
<p>Building relationships takes time. With a photography project, you will have to make time for it to be effective. Returning to photograph the same people and/or the same location a familiarity will develop.</p>
<h3>On the street</h3>
<p>Stand on the same busy street corner and photograph people enough, and you will begin to build some form of relationship. You&#8217;ll become familiar with the feel of the place.</p>
<p>Learn to anticipate what&#8217;s happening and see the rhythm. Picking the same time of day when the light is right, you will start to see the same people passing by during their daily routines. They may start to notice you. If they see you often enough, they will not likely pay you any attention, unless you want it.</p>
<p>All it takes, when you catch someone&#8217;s eye who has become a little familiar to you, is to smile. They will probably return one to you. Next time they see you, they may show interest and inquire what you are doing.</p>
<p>Connecting with people on the streets becomes more natural when they see you with your camera often. Some won&#8217;t show interest, but many will. The locals, the regulars, people who frequent the same location, are the most obvious ones to connect with.</p>
<p>These are the ones you can begin building a relationship with. Tell them you&#8217;re working on a photography project documenting your local neighborhood (or whatever your theme is). This will endear them because people like to feel included. We are designed to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>Even if you are a shy person, you can learn to use your camera as a bridge to achieve your purpose.</p>

<h3>With a friend or family member</h3>
<p>Photographing a friend or family member as a project, you will also develop your relationship with them. However they respond to you first, and how you relate to each other will change subtly each time you get together.</p>
<p>Show them some of your photos on your phone. They will be more confident when they can see the photos you’ve already taken. Don’t talk too long about what you’re doing; you want the attention to be on them.</p>
<p>You are best to have set your camera as much as possible before you meet with the person. If that’s not possible, ask them to give you a few minutes to set up. Doing this gives you space to scope out good light and background and to make the necessary camera tweaks.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the light, background and your camera settings, it’s time to give most of your attention to your subject. Straighten their clothes a little, or get them to fix their hair, (unless it’s already perfect). Giving them this attention will help them feel better about themselves and build their confidence in you.</p>
<p>If it’s someone you don’t know well, ask them open-ended questions about themselves. Get to know them a little more. Make sure you start them talking.</p>
<p>If they are extroverts, they will love talking about themselves.</p>
<p>If they are introverts, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/4-tips-helping-people-feel-comfortable-during-their-portrait-session/">you can help them get started</a>, and they will feel more comfortable.</p>

<p>Focus on asking questions that a simple yes or no won&#8217;t answer. Pay attention to what they are telling you. Do not be looking down at your camera. Focus on their story. Show them you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Compliment what they are wearing or something else about the way they look. Aim to build up a positive atmosphere, especially if you sense they are feeling uneasy. Many people do not feel self-assured when being photographed. It&#8217;s an important part of your job to help them relax. The better they feel the more attractive they will look in the photos you take.</p>
<p>Initially, they may be shy also and feel awkward in front of your camera. Don&#8217;t worry about this. Make a bunch of photos and concentrate on relating to them. If you screw up and don&#8217;t get any decent images, use this as a lesson. Show them. Let them see what you are doing right and wrong.</p>
<p>Include them in your project, make it a team effort. The more they feel part of what you are doing the better photos you&#8217;ll end up taking. If you&#8217;ve messed up your settings, show them the photos and explain a little about what happened. Then make the same series of photos again.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/people-skills-portrait-photographers-need/">Learning to communicate</a> in such a manner that you help people enjoy the process of being photographed will benefit you and your subjects. Everybody enjoys seeing themselves looking good. Their feeling must precede their looks in your photos. If they don&#8217;t feel good about themselves, it&#8217;s likely they will not appreciate the photos you make of them.</p>
<p>At times your subject will be too uncomfortable. You won&#8217;t manage to make a flattering photo of them because of their tension. Show them the photos. Explain that the tension shows on their face and if they relax, they will like the photos you make of them.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t usually look nervous when they view themselves in the bathroom mirror each morning. So when they see photos of themselves looking tense, it&#8217;s very unnatural to them. They do not perceive the image as a good likeness of who they are.</p>
<p>Working like this and showing off less than your best photos may be challenging, but it will help you grow.</p>

<h3>Photograph at social gatherings</h3>
<p>Take your camera along to birthday parties, drinks after work, your kid&#8217;s sports events, or any place where people socialize. Doing so provides wonderful opportunities for people photography. When you can mix with the same people regularly, they will become accustomed to you being there with your camera.</p>
<p>For many people, this may seem a huge challenge. Think positively about it. Approach the situation and the people with a constructive attitude and with reasonable expectations. You will most likely find people will enjoy what you are doing, particularly when you start sharing your photos with them.</p>
<p>Be determined to work through your feelings of discomfort. Your first experience taking photos at a social gathering might be very difficult. Most of your uneasiness will be in your mind. If you give up after your first attempt, you will not know success. The more often you are present with your camera, the more confident you will become and the better photographs you will make.</p>

<h3>Become a volunteer photographer</h3>
<p>Do you go to church, a temple or a mosque? Are you or your kids a member of a sports club? Do you help out at a local animal shelter or participate in community events? All of these provide a fabulous opportunity to offer your services as a photographer.</p>
<p>Every group or organization loves to have good photographs. Putting yourself forward as a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/volunteering-your-photography/">volunteer photographer</a> can be a great experience. Here your camera really is your bridge.</p>
<p>Providing photos for a group or organization can be one of the best ways to build your confidence. Your commitment is greater because other people are relying on you.</p>
<p>Making it clear you are still learning is important. So long as they know this then you have the opportunity to improve over time. In the future, you will be producing wonderful photographs for the community you are volunteering for.</p>

<h3>Travel portrait projects</h3>
<p>I teach many people who mainly take photographs when they <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-shoot-engaging-travel-portraits/">travel</a>. They join our workshops, and many are too timid to photograph people. Or they prefer to stand well back and take candid pictures with a long lens.</p>
<p>Don’t be concerned if you can’t speak the language. Often this can be to your advantage. Use your camera as a bridge. When people see the smile on your face and even a slight gesture with your camera, they will know your intention. Hopefully, they will return your smile. This is permission to photograph them.</p>
<p>Non-verbal communication like this requires that you watch facial expression and body language. Some cultures may smile and mean ‘no.’ So long as you are observant and polite, you will be okay.</p>

<h2>The candid option</h2>
<p>Certain situations are best photographed without communicating with a person. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-for-taking-candid-portraits-of-people/">Candid photography</a> definitely has its place.</p>
<p>Choosing to stand back with a long lens attached to your camera and making candid images is okay when the circumstances are right. The photos you create using this technique will usually be void of subject/photographer connection.</p>
<p>Disturbing people who are engrossed in a conversation or their work breaks the natural flow of life. A candid photo will be more suitable than interrupting.</p>
<p>Artists and craftspeople at work are subjects best left to their creative endeavors. They are focused and passionate about what they are doing. A quick recognition and acknowledgment from them that they are comfortable with you photographing are best. A nod and a smile from you and their smile in return will not break their workflow or concentration. So long as you are not disrupting them, you will be able to capture intriguing portraits of them.</p>
<p>Choosing to work candidly should be a conscious decision because it’s going to produce the best photographs. Opting to capture images of people stealthily because you are too shy to communicate is never the best option.</p>

<h2>Those not really candid photographs</h2>
<p>At times you’ll find yourself in situations where you want candid photographs, but it’s just not possible. When people know you are there with your camera, truly-candid cannot happen. Capturing natural-looking photos of people in these circumstances is challenging, but not impossible.</p>
<h3>When you are ‘the’ photographer</h3>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/wedding-portraits-5-tips-getting-creative/">Weddings</a>, portrait sessions, and similar situations do not allow for real candid photos. You have to be able to communicate well and arrange candid-looking images.</p>
<p>Most people like natural-looking photos. The skill is in controlling the circumstances so you get the results you want. This means you must know what you want and be able to relate your ideas clearly to the people you are photographing.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/fun-ways-photograph-couples-awkward/">couples</a>, it’s easy. Just get them talking to each other. Encourage them to forget you’re there and then offer them a conversation starter. Ask them to recall the first time they met, or when they proposed to each other. If you want to lighten the mood and capture some laughter and smiles, ask them something fun.</p>
<p>Once you have them talking, don’t hold back on the photos. You are going to need to take a lot of pictures. What’s happening is more unpredictable, so you need the quantity to get enough quality photos.</p>

<p>You will throw most of them out, but the ones you keep will be relaxed, natural, and vibrant. I used this technique whenever I photographed weddings. It helped produce the most interesting, un-posed photos.</p>
<p>I would use a longer lens, often my 180mm, so I could stay at a bit of a distance, but not too far away. That way, I could still talk with the couple but be far enough back so as not to be in their personal space.</p>
<p>Another wedding technique I used for semi-candid portraits was to get the groom to stand behind me and off to one side. While photographing the bride, I would get them to look at each other and have a conversation. If the groom was somehow stuck for things to say I would make suggestions, often a little rude. This worked well for getting fun, relaxed facial expressions. Then I would swap the bride and groom, and photograph him while they continued their conversation.</p>
<p>Photographing individual portraits is more challenging as you can’t draw attention away from yourself so easily. If you have someone else with you, an assistant or friend, you can prime them to be the distraction. Before you begin, let them know they will have a role to play when you want some more candid-looking photos. Coach them a little so that they will be prepared. When you’re ready, direct your subject’s attention and conversation to your helper.</p>
<p>Working alone is when your communication skills are the most important. Your ability to converse and take photos at the same time will be put to the test. You have to give full concentration to both your subject and what you are doing with your camera.</p>
<p>The practice is again the key in learning how to build your communication skill so you can get candid-looking portraits. It takes time and effort. As you try certain techniques and figure out what works and what doesn’t, you will develop your communication skill set. You will become more confident and effective.</p>

<h3>Semi-candid street photography</h3>
<p>Semi-candid street photos can be made successfully with a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/which-street-photography-lens-right/">short lens</a> and the right technique. You don’t need to keep your distance and remain in the shadows. Get close, be observant, relaxed, and normal.</p>
<p>People at our local markets know me now. They sell me vegetables, and many of them know I will take their photo some days. They might shy away, or they might pose.</p>
<p>I like to create a mixture of candid and posed photos when I am doing <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/conquer-biggest-fear-street-photography/">street photography</a>. However, being conspicuous means, I have to employ certain techniques so that I am not the center of attention. Often there are not many other foreigners at the markets, so I stand out.</p>
<p>Often I will engage with someone I want to photograph. Generally, they will stop what they are doing, smile, and pose. This is what they perceive I want. I will take their picture anyway. I’ll make sure it’s well exposed, sharp and flattering. Then I will show them on my camera monitor. Most often they are happy, and we’ll chat a little before I move on.</p>
<p>Once I have moved on, I will wait a short time and then head back near to where they are. They will think my focus is elsewhere because I already have their photo.</p>
<p>Hopefully, they will not pay any attention to me. This is when I get the photos I really want.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have listened to and read of many photojournalists who aspire to be as invisible as possible. It can be a valuable skill to develop. You can learn to do it without actually having to hide your camera or stay a long way back from the action.</p>

<h2>Giving back</h2>
<p>Remember, your camera is the solution, not the problem. With your camera in hand, you have a purpose for being where you are and a reason to communicate with people.</p>
<p>You are not only taking a photograph but giving an interesting experience. If you are able to share your photos, then you are truly giving something of value to your subject.</p>
<p>Presenting prints to the people you photograph helps shape the way they see you. A set of small-sized prints is inexpensive and will be appreciated by most. If you capture a photo that’s worthy of enlarging this will have even more of an impact. The cost of an enlargement is insignificant compared to the joy it will bring your subject.</p>
<p>Collecting someone’s email or social media connection will also allow you to give back in a meaningful way. Some people may value this even more than prints because they can share a digital file.</p>

<h2>Smile and say ‘hello’</h2>
<p>I often walk the same way at the markets when teaching our photography workshops. I’d been noticing this one older man. His face was interesting, but he seemed shy and would not make eye contact with me. He had a small stand selling traditional northern Thai sticky rice. I decided I would smile and say hello to him each time I passed with the hope he would become familiar with me.</p>
<p>I did this for a while, and one day when my wife was helping me teach a workshop, I told her what I had been doing. As we approached him, she smiled and asked if we could make his portrait. She had the charm! He placed his hands on the big bowl of sticky rice, pushed his shoulders back, and smiled warmly for us. We made some lovely portraits of him.</p>
<p>Not long after this, I had another lovely encounter with a woman who was selling sticky rice at the same stall. Each time we visited the markets, we’d have a lovely conversation with this woman. She was friendly and relaxed, quite happy to be photographed. Having not seen the man at the stall for a few months, one day I asked her about him.</p>
<p>Her face dropped, and her eyes looked so sad. I wanted the ground to swallow me up. I felt so terrible. The man was her husband. She told me that he’d passed away suddenly. Then a glimmer of hope appeared in her eyes, and she asked me if I’d made his portrait. I assured her I had and would bring her a print.</p>
<p>Normally when we print photos to give out, we get regular size prints. For this lady, we had an enlargement made and had it framed. She was very grateful. The next time I passed by she told me she had hung the portrait of her husband above her bed.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is, you never know how much you might bless someone by being bold enough to make their portrait. Think of what you do in a positive light. Sure, you will come across some people who do not want their photograph taken. As you practice building your confidence, your success rate will increase.</p>

<h2>Know where the sun is at all times</h2>
<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to know where the sun is at all times. The easiest way to do this is to use an ephemeris (I personally use <a href="http://app.photoephemeris.com">this one</a>). This is a tool that can help you see where the sun will be at any time during the day.</p>
<div id="attachment_175206" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175206" class="size-full wp-image-175206" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographer-ephemeris.jpg?resize=1500%2C1427&#038;ssl=1" alt="Image: Here you can see where the sun will rise from, set, and the times when these will be happenin..." width="1500" height="1427" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographer-ephemeris.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographer-ephemeris.jpg?resize=300%2C285&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographer-ephemeris.jpg?resize=768%2C731&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographer-ephemeris.jpg?resize=600%2C571&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographer-ephemeris.jpg?resize=717%2C682&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-175206" class="wp-caption-text">Here you can see where the sun will rise from, set, and the times when these will be happening during the day.</p></div>
<p>Before, or even while you&#8217;re <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/right-location-for-your-photo-session/">scheduling your session</a>, you can quickly check this tool to see the sunrise, midday, and sunset times.</p>
<p>An ephemeris can give you the details on the direction the light is coming from at a particular point in the world. Simply plug in the location of your session, and you can see all of the important details.</p>

<p>This is really helpful since no beach is alike and the direction of light differs from one side of the world to another. For example, in California, the sun sets behind the beach. Whereas on the east coast, the sun sets in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Also, different beaches may face differently and therefore it&#8217;s good to know where the sun will be during your session.</p>
<h2>Morning light</h2>
<p>Morning light on a beach is magical. It has a whole different <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-achieve-color-accuracy-in-photos/">color temperature</a> than that of the golden hour and can provide a nice soft glow if you have your session early enough.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175207" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-morning-beach.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Take Better Beach Portraits at Anytime of the Day" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-morning-beach.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-morning-beach.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-morning-beach.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-morning-beach.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-morning-beach.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-morning-beach.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The light is a little bluer, and depending on the beach where your session is taking place, the sun can rise overlooking the ocean or peaking through the trees. For example, a beach on the east coast like Cancun can mean during your session in the morning you&#8217;ll catch the sunrise behind the beach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175208" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/morning-beach-portrait-photos.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Take Better Beach Portraits at Anytime of the Day" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/morning-beach-portrait-photos.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/morning-beach-portrait-photos.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/morning-beach-portrait-photos.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/morning-beach-portrait-photos.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/morning-beach-portrait-photos.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, on a beach in California, you&#8217;ll catch the sun hitting the water from the land side. This will give you that beautiful yellowish-blue glow if your session is before 9 o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Use a simple <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/lastolite-halo-compact-reflector/">reflector</a> to bounce light back onto your subject if you feel the sunrise light causes shadows. This is especially useful if sunrise is behind the water at the beach.</p>
<h2>Midday light</h2>
<p><a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/portrait-photography-bright-midday-sun/">Midday light</a> at a beach is pretty harsh and therefore it&#8217;s good to have some kind of additional lighting equipment to help with shadows. You can use an <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-manual-mode-on-your-external-flash/">external flash</a>, popup flash, or a <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-ways-of-using-reflector-to-take-better-portraits/">reflector</a>.</p>

<p>You can also go without an additional light source. However, it&#8217;s good to underexpose your photos a bit so you can bring up the shadows in your editing software. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll end up with really blown out skies. Of course, this all depends on your style of photography.</p>

<p>When the sun is at it&#8217;s highest point during the day, it might be a good time to take your clients under the shade of some trees nearby or opt to have more playful photos of the family. Have your client&#8217;s walk, run, splash in the water, build sandcastles, or just have a bit of fun together.</p>
<p>The sun is at it&#8217;s highest at different times around the world, so make sure to check the ephemeris for your exact location to know the time.</p>

<p>Once the sun passes the highest point, it will be at a bit of an angle as it starts to go down for sunset. This is the sweet spot of photographing during midday sun at the beach!</p>
<div id="attachment_175213" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175213" class="wp-image-175213 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photos-midday-beach.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Image: Flash was used to correctly expose the photo and fill in shadows caused by the sun." width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photos-midday-beach.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photos-midday-beach.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photos-midday-beach.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photos-midday-beach.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photos-midday-beach.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photos-midday-beach.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-175213" class="wp-caption-text">Flash was used to correctly expose the photo and fill in shadows caused by the sun.</p></div>
<p>When the sun is at a bit of an angle, you can pose your clients with the sun behind them to alleviate having the sun in their eyes. This means you&#8217;ll be in the sun, but it&#8217;s better than having your clients facing the sun. This avoids causing shadows, uneven lighting, and squinting. The sand can also work as a natural reflector, bouncing light back into their faces.</p>
<h2>After midday light</h2>
<p>After midday light can be different in the winter than in the summer given that daylight savings can change the amount of light you have left. Either way, the sun sits lower to be at an angle behind your clients. All while still hitting the sand to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-natural-light-reflectors-portraits/">reflect some light</a> into your client&#8217;s faces.</p>

<p>During this time, depending on the angle of light, you can get some really interesting light. It gets more golden by the hour as you approach sunset.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175215" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-portraits-at-beach-anytime.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Take Better Beach Portraits at Anytime of the Day" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-portraits-at-beach-anytime.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-portraits-at-beach-anytime.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-portraits-at-beach-anytime.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-portraits-at-beach-anytime.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/photographing-portraits-at-beach-anytime.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Still, if you find yourself at a beach where the light is still harsh during this time, try and angle your clients away from the sun. You can also try and use your external lighting to help fill in some light.</p>
<h2>Golden Hour (Sunset)</h2>
<p>Actual sunset only lasts about 5-10 minutes. However, <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-tips-golden-hour-photography/">golden hour</a> is just that – about an hour before the sun dips behind the horizon, which means the angle of the light is pretty low and directional. It can mean flooding your photos with lots of that pretty golden light. However, it also makes it difficult to capture your clients evenly lit against the background.</p>

<p>This is especially troublesome if the sun sets behind the water. It can be difficult capturing the beautiful colors of the sunset while also lighting your clients.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175217" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-golden-hour-at-beach.jpg?resize=1500%2C1125&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Take Better Beach Portraits at Anytime of the Day" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-golden-hour-at-beach.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-golden-hour-at-beach.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-golden-hour-at-beach.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-golden-hour-at-beach.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-golden-hour-at-beach.jpg?resize=717%2C538&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Using a flash or external light source pointed directly at your clients can help light them while capturing the sunset behind. You can also underexpose your photo a bit to bring up the shadows later without compromising the sunset.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175218" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/golden-hour-portraits.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Take Better Beach Portraits at Anytime of the Day" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/golden-hour-portraits.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/golden-hour-portraits.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/golden-hour-portraits.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/golden-hour-portraits.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/golden-hour-portraits.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/golden-hour-portraits.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Try silhouetting your clients behind with the sunset light to offer a different look to the final images.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175219" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-photos.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Take Better Beach Portraits at Anytime of the Day" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-photos.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-photos.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-photos.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-photos.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-photos.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sunset-photos.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Golden hour is also a perfect time to turn your clients toward the setting sun to get that beautiful golden color cast on their skin tones and in the overall look of the photo.</p>
<h2>Blue hour (After sunset)</h2>
<p>Blue hour is the 20-30 minutes (sometimes less time) after the sun has completely gone from view. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-steps-for-photographing-the-blue-hour/">Blue hour</a> is nice to photograph in because of the beautiful sunset colors like blue, orange, pink, and purples that come out after sunset. The lighting is a bit darker, so you might need a tripod.</p>

<p>During this time you can attempt some <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-slow-shutter-speed-to-create-motion-blur/">slow shutter speed</a> photos while your clients hold still. Getting the movement in water can create a more fine art approach to beach photos!</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter the time of day, it&#8217;s good to get variety in your <a href="https://resources.digital-photography-school.com/download/67-portrait-poses-printable-book/">portraits</a> during beach sessions. For that try some of these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rock formations/caves as backgrounds and also shelter from harsh light.</li>
<li>Trees can provide shade as well if the light is harsh and the day is particularly hot.</li>
<li>Around town can also serve as a nice background for photos while you&#8217;re waiting for the midday sun to angle a bit.</li>
<li>Up high can also serve as a nice way to keep clients out of harsh sunlight. For example, a balcony in their hotel room, a higher terrace with some shade that overlooks the ocean, etc.</li>
<li>Photographing more lifestyle-type photos with the family playing, getting in the water, and just having a &#8220;beach day&#8221;.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Photographing at the beach during golden hour isn&#8217;t the only time that you can create one-of-a-kind and amazingly beautiful images for your clients.</p>

<p>It is incredibly beneficial to learn to photograph at the beach at any time of the day. Moreover, it can mean the difference between a client choosing you and another photographer.</p>

<h2>Putting together a portfolio</h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter what kind of photographer you are, a good portfolio is the most important tool you have to secure a job. The first thing to understand is that putting together a bunch of nice pictures isn&#8217;t enough. Your photography portfolio should be a sample of your work that showcases your technical abilities as well as your personal style.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174654" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Tutorial.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1" alt="Flower and nature portfolio" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Tutorial.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Tutorial.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Tutorial.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Tutorial.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Tutorial.jpg?resize=90%2C60&amp;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Tutorial.jpg?resize=717%2C478&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2>DON’T put watermarks</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, if someone wants to steal your photograph, they will find a way to do so. A watermark can be cropped or deleted. Instead, it will make it more difficult for the viewer to appreciate your image. Also, watermarks give an amateurish look to your portfolio as a whole. See at the difference:</p>
<div id="attachment_174566" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174566" class="wp-image-174566 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Watermark.jpg?resize=1500%2C1116&#038;ssl=1" alt="putting-together-a-portfolio " width="1500" height="1116" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Watermark.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Watermark.jpg?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Watermark.jpg?resize=768%2C571&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Watermark.jpg?resize=600%2C446&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Watermark.jpg?resize=717%2C533&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-174566" class="wp-caption-text">Watermarks can ruin a photo and don&#8217;t really protect your rights</p></div>
<p>To legally protect your images, you can have them copyrighted. To get familiar with this concept, read <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/image-rights-copyright-infringement/">ImageRights &#8211; Finding and Pursuing Copyright Infringement.</a> Another safety measure is to never publish or hand out high-resolution images. For this, I recommend my previous article on <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-pixels-resolution-resize-photoshop/">How to Understand Pixels, Resolution, and Resize your Images in Photoshop Correctly</a>.</p>
<h2>DON’T stick to one portfolio</h2>
<p>Another big mistake is to collect all of your best photos and display them in one portfolio. You may think this shows quality, as they are a &#8220;best-of,&#8221; but it can make you look like a master of none. It is also a waste of time for your client. They want to see relevant examples that show how you would do their job, not how good you may be at other things.</p>

<p>Take these two photos, for example – they don&#8217;t even look good together. And let&#8217;s face it, someone who needs a food photographer, doesn&#8217;t really care about how I can photograph a street fair and vice-versa. If you&#8217;re not convinced about limiting your practice, have a look at these <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/5-things-to-consider-before-deciding-to-specialize-or-not-in-your-photography/">5 Things to Consider Before Deciding to Specialize or Not in Your Photography</a>.</p>
<h2>DO feature what you’re selling</h2>
<p>I was talking before about the importance of having different portfolios. This means that each one should display a different specialty that you offer. It’s always important to be coherent and properly organize your work. For example, a portrait portfolio shouldn&#8217;t just include any kind of photography that features people. Let me illustrate this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-174508 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Photo_Styles.jpg?resize=1500%2C1105&#038;ssl=1" alt="Different kinds of photography. Photography specialization" width="1500" height="1105" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Photo_Styles.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Photo_Styles.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Photo_Styles.jpg?resize=768%2C566&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Photo_Styles.jpg?resize=600%2C442&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_Photo_Styles.jpg?resize=717%2C528&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Take the two photos above, the one on the left comes from a photo-shoot I did for the press kit of a theater play. The one on the right is a behind-the-scenes job I was doing for a short movie. If I&#8217;m preparing a portfolio for a movie or theater producer I can include both. If I&#8217;m preparing a portrait portfolio then I shouldn&#8217;t include the one on the right.</p>
<h2>DO ask for help</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s always helpful to ask for opinions once you&#8217;ve shortlisted the images you want to use. If you can reach out to a colleague or an expert it would be great, but if you don&#8217;t, at least ask a friend. Often we have an emotional attachment to a photo we took that is actually not great. An external point of view can help you sort out your best images.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-174567 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_how_to_choose.jpg?resize=1500%2C1106&#038;ssl=1" alt="putting-together-a-photography-portfolio" width="1500" height="1106" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_how_to_choose.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_how_to_choose.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_how_to_choose.jpg?resize=768%2C566&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_how_to_choose.jpg?resize=600%2C442&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Portfolio_Dos-_and_Donts_how_to_choose.jpg?resize=717%2C529&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Try putting two similar images from the same subject and asking them which one they prefer. A friend can also help you decide if you are putting too many or too few images in your portfolio. Keep in mind that you should never include something that is not good enough just to reach a certain number. Also, don&#8217;t overdo it – editors are busy people and have many portfolios to review.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum up, there is no specific formula for putting together a photography portfolio that is great, but I hope you found these tips useful and time-saving. DO remember that the most important thing is for you to have a strong body of work.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-175690 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/canon-nikon-IBIS-45.jpg?resize=1500%2C577&#038;ssl=1" alt="canon-nikon-IBIS" width="1500" height="577" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/canon-nikon-IBIS-45.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/canon-nikon-IBIS-45.jpg?resize=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/canon-nikon-IBIS-45.jpg?resize=768%2C295&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/canon-nikon-IBIS-45.jpg?resize=600%2C231&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/canon-nikon-IBIS-45.jpg?resize=717%2C276&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In-body image stabilization (IBIS) has long been resisted by the two DSLR giants, Nikon and Canon.</p>
<p>But recent rumors indicate that both Canon and Nikon will be breaking into new territory, with IBIS technology added to upcoming DSLRs for both brands.</p>
<p>Up until now, in-body image stabilization has been confined to Nikon&#8217;s mirrorless lineup. And while reports indicate that the followup to the (mirrorless) <a href="https://geni.us/dpsCanonEOS-R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canon EOS R</a> will include IBIS, there was no definitive information about DSLR in-body stabilization.</p>
<p>Then, in April, rumors indicated that Nikon would be introducing in-body image stabilization to the D6, Nikon&#8217;s future flagship DSLR (with a possible release date in the first half of 2020). This was followed by further reports that the D6 was delayed due to the decision to add in-body image stabilization.</p>
<p>And just last week, Canon Rumors reported that &#8220;Canon will &#8216;definitely&#8217; bring IBIS to &#8216;select&#8217; DSLRs in the near future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canon Rumors was uncertain &#8220;which camera(s) would be getting IBIS,&#8221; but explained that &#8220;the EOS 90D, which is coming in the next couple of months,&#8221; is a strong possibility.</p>
<p>Sources have also discussed the possibility that the Canon 1DX Mark III will have in-body image stabilization, so it can go toe-to-toe with the upcoming Nikon D6. Both the <a href="https://geni.us/dPSCanon1DXmkII" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Canon 1DX</a> bodies and the Nikon D6 bodies are direct competitors, catering to professional photographers who require high frame rates and exceptional durability.</p>
<p>Now, Nikon and Canon have always maintained that lens stabilization is superior to in-body image stabilization, due to increased flexibility in the lens as compared to the camera body. This may well be true, but many phenomenal Canon and Nikon lenses don&#8217;t include image stabilization. So photographers of all levels will undoubtedly appreciate this move to in-body stabilization.</p>
<p>It will certainly be a boon to those who tend to shoot <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/6-tips-shoot-low-light-without-tripod/">handheld in low light</a>.</p>
<p>So let me ask you:</p>
<p>Are you excited about the possibility of IBIS in new Canon and Nikon DSLRs?</p>
<p>And would you like to see IBIS in the upcoming Canon 90D?</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments!</p>

It was authored by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digital-photography-school.com/author/charlie-moss/">Charlie Moss</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion of using presets or not comes up time and time again on various photography groups and websites. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/7-reasons-youd-crazy-not-use-lightroom-presets/">Some people are for them</a> and others are against. Just like camera brands, it seems there is no clear answer, and everyone believes that their way is correct! For or against, it&#8217;s undeniable that presets are here and they&#8217;re not going anywhere. Many people <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/the-beginners-guide-to-lightroom-presets/">find them useful</a> in their workflow and so they will keep using them. So, should you purchase Lightroom presets?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174251" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-sports-photography.jpg?resize=1500%2C844&#038;ssl=1" alt="Should You Purchase Lightroom Presets?" width="1500" height="844" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-sports-photography.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-sports-photography.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-sports-photography.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-sports-photography.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-sports-photography.jpg?resize=717%2C403&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2>The case for buying presets</h2>
<p>A quick search online will give you hundreds of places you can buy presets and they will all have varying quality. Before you make your purchase, be sure to read some reviews to see if others are happy with their purchase. Remember that your style of images will heavily affect the way presets look when applied, so expect some trial and error!</p>
<p>But why would you buy presets rather than <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-create-your-own-lightroom-presets/">make them yourself from scratch</a>? Here are some reasons to help you decide if buying presets is for you.</p>
<h3>It will save you time</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt about it, buying presets will save you time in your workflow. You won&#8217;t have to spend time coming up with looks that you like. Instead, someone else has completed the initial hard work for you.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-174253 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/buying-presets-portrait.jpg?resize=1500%2C1119&#038;ssl=1" alt="Should-You-Purchase-Lightroom-Presets-4" width="1500" height="1119" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/buying-presets-portrait.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/buying-presets-portrait.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/buying-presets-portrait.jpg?resize=768%2C573&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/buying-presets-portrait.jpg?resize=600%2C448&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/buying-presets-portrait.jpg?resize=717%2C535&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In reality, using presets in this way is no different from choosing what film stock and developer you&#8217;d like to use if you&#8217;re shooting analog. You&#8217;re using someone else&#8217;s color toning ideas to achieve the images you want to produce.</p>
<p>Being able to quickly apply lots of different looks to your photo can help you quickly make decisions about how it will look. And then you can set about refining it and doing the fun part of processing.</p>
<h3>It gets you away from the computer</h3>
<p>Not everyone loves the digital darkroom. During the summer, I&#8217;d rather be taking advantage of the good weather than sitting at my computer developing images. Having a set of presets available to me that someone else has created means each shot takes less time to process. That way, I&#8217;m spending more time doing the things I love.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-174252 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-for-interiors.jpg?resize=1500%2C1119&#038;ssl=1" alt="Should-You-Purchase-Lightroom-Presets-3" width="1500" height="1119" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-for-interiors.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-for-interiors.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-for-interiors.jpg?resize=768%2C573&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-for-interiors.jpg?resize=600%2C448&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lightroom-presets-for-interiors.jpg?resize=717%2C535&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I can share stylish images that I&#8217;m proud of within minutes of loading my images into Lightroom thanks to my preset library. That&#8217;s a big draw for me, and that&#8217;s why I love having a bank of presets ready for me to choose from.</p>
<h3>You can borrow the best of other peoples ideas</h3>
<p>Everybody sees the world differently. You might never have thought to put a pop of pink in the shadows or add just enough grain to make your black and white conversion look like it was shot on fast film.</p>
<p>By purchasing a library of presets, you can see how other people might have chosen to process your images. And that might give you a few ideas for a new direction that you want to head in. Purchasing Lightroom presets really can <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/boost-your-creativity-with-lightroom-presets/">boost your creativity</a> and help you see new possibilities for your images.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-174250 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/louvre-lightroom-preset.jpg?resize=1500%2C1119&#038;ssl=1" alt="Should-You-Purchase-Lightroom-Presets-2" width="1500" height="1119" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/louvre-lightroom-preset.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/louvre-lightroom-preset.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/louvre-lightroom-preset.jpg?resize=768%2C573&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/louvre-lightroom-preset.jpg?resize=600%2C448&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/louvre-lightroom-preset.jpg?resize=717%2C535&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Some people would say this is &#8216;cheating&#8217; somehow, but I think of it as gathering inspiration. It&#8217;s like an artist going to her friend&#8217;s studio, finding the most beautiful custom blue paint and then asking if she can have the recipe to use the color in her own work. The two artists won&#8217;t be producing the same artwork even if they use the same color paint!</p>
<p>Your photos will still have your own touch and your own style even if you use other peoples ideas to help you shoot or post-process your images.</p>
<h3>Some people are just better at post-processing and color grading than you</h3>
<p>Face it – you can&#8217;t be amazing at everything. Even the best photographers often employ other people to help create their vision. Buying presets is like a real cheap version of having your own digital tech assistant available for your shoots. If you have a vision of light and airy photos but your post-processing skills aren&#8217;t quite up to it, then presets can help you get there – just like a digital tech assistant would on a high-end shoot.</p>
<p>Over time, you can learn more about this side of photography. But you can start getting great results now by taking advantage of other peoples knowledge and creativity.</p>
<h2>The case for making presets yourself</h2>
<p>Of course, if you love working in the digital darkroom, then the idea of buying presets to save time or get ideas might seem completely alien to you. Moreover, if you like spending the time to <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/make-creative-lightroom-develop-presets-portraits/">make your own presets</a>, then that&#8217;s great! You should absolutely continue to do what makes you happy.</p>
<p>There are other reasons too that you might want to make your own presets. The most obvious one is that presets available to purchase may not be exactly what you&#8217;re looking for. When you make your own, you can have exactly what you want rather than just getting close.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174249" src="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sports-photography-presets.jpg?resize=1119%2C1499&#038;ssl=1" alt="Should You Purchase Lightroom Presets?" width="1119" height="1499" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sports-photography-presets.jpg?w=1119&amp;ssl=1 1119w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sports-photography-presets.jpg?resize=224%2C300&amp;ssl=1 224w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sports-photography-presets.jpg?resize=768%2C1029&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sports-photography-presets.jpg?resize=448%2C600&amp;ssl=1 448w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sports-photography-presets.jpg?resize=717%2C960&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You might have other considerations too. For instance, some camera clubs do not allow you to enter images into competitions where you have used purchased presets in their post-processing. Or you may feel that ethically a picture cannot be truly called your own unless you created every single part of the image.</p>
<h2>Perhaps try a combination?</h2>
<p>Personally, I use a combination of both. I have a large library of presets that I&#8217;ve purchased. I use this library to quickly see what images could look like with different color grading applied to them.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;ve found a look that I love, I tweak it slightly to suit the mood of my images even more. If I think I&#8217;ll use the preset again, I then save my new custom preset in a folder with the others that I&#8217;ve tweaked to suit my style!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-174248 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oxford-presets-lightroom.jpg?resize=1500%2C1119&#038;ssl=1" alt="Should-You-Purchase-Lightroom-Presets" width="1500" height="1119" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oxford-presets-lightroom.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oxford-presets-lightroom.jpg?resize=300%2C224&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oxford-presets-lightroom.jpg?resize=768%2C573&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oxford-presets-lightroom.jpg?resize=600%2C448&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oxford-presets-lightroom.jpg?resize=717%2C535&amp;ssl=1 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I like this way of working because I enjoy getting inspiration from other peoples presets, and then finishing the images off to achieve something that is genuinely my own.</p>
<p>What do you think about buying presets? Should you purchase Lightroom presets? Perhaps you have a library of your own that you&#8217;ve already purchased? Or do you prefer to make all of yours from scratch? Maybe you don&#8217;t use presets at all, instead preferring to start each time with a blank slate when it comes to post-processing images?</p>
