      "content_html": "<p>I try to be nice to people.</p>\n\n<p>While being nice is relatively popular here in Canada, being nice is not necessarily popular in the business world. There’s something about business that makes some people feel like it’s a license to be a heel. “Well, that’s business, kid.”</p>\n\n<p>Well, that’s not the kind of business I want to be in. Over the years, my team and I have made a point of making nice things and being nice to each other while we’re at it. It’s pretty simple, and it makes for a nice work environment. It’s great.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/aggro.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>A few years back, I was at the excellent XOXO conference in Portland. Some friends and I were sitting in the sun, enjoying our cereal from a van or whatever weird-ass Portland breakfast we were eating, when an acquaintance came over from a nearby food cart with a delicious-looking free-range egg sandwich.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this was a developer I’m friendly with and am always happy to see, so we quickly got to chatting. And as I talked and my acquaintance ate, he had the misfortune of getting some egg on himself.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed, but I hesitated to call attention to it. To call out somebody’s appearance in a public setting, that’s not very nice, is it? So I did a rather Canadian thing – I acted like nothing was wrong.</p>\n\n<p>This was a miscalculation. You see, I hadn’t considered that eventually, inevitably, my conversation partner would realize my deceit. Indeed, before long he noticed that, in a very literal sense, he had egg on his face.</p>\n\n<p>Upon discovering this, he asked mournfully, “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>\n\n<p>It was a very good question. I may have felt like I was being nice, and perhaps by some shallow definition I was. But I was definitely not being kind. Immediately, I felt like the one with egg on my face. While I can only hope my friend has long since forgotten this minor cruelty, that moment has stuck with me.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"being-kind-vs-being-nice\">Being kind vs. being nice</h2>\n<p>The distinction between niceness and kindness can seem subtle. While being nice might involve acting polite, positive, and pleasant, being kind is deeper – it’s about being caring, sympathetic, and helpful. In many circumstances the kind thing to do is simply to be nice. In some circumstances though, the kind thing to do is to be direct. Or clear. Or firm.</p>\n\n<p>In learning to run a business, I found early on that however nice you are, you still need to set distinct boundaries and limits with clients in order to, for example, <a href=\"https://allenpike.com/2016/getting-paid-receivables\">get paid</a>. And when it comes to close friends and family, it can be second nature to prioritize kindness, even when it means having a less than nice conversation to help fix a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The difficulty comes, I find, with acquaintances and colleagues that I’m not necessarily close to, where I can easily get away with just being nice. It can be too easy to just have conversations that are pleasant but shallow, avoiding the more uncomfortable but more helpful line of discourse. Kim Scott’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01KTIEFEE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect\">Radical Candor</a> and countless other feedback systems are built around the idea that over-prioritizing niceness – what Scott calls “ruinous empathy” – is a short-term salve that causes long-term pain.</p>\n\n<p>So, recently, I’ve been working to have deeper conversations with the people around me. I’ve been trying to ask myself: does this person necessarily <em>care</em> how polite I’m being, or would they rather I just prioritize being clear? It’s a bit more work, but often – especially in person – you can still do both.</p>\n\n<p>I feel lucky to work somewhere where people are nice to each other, and I definitely don’t want to lose that. But there’s another notch above being nice; the next step on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Teams. Where you need to get is a culture where being nice is the default, but being kind – including having hard but helpful conversations – gets priority over always being pleasant.</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, a place where you can trust that somebody will speak up – even if you have egg on you.</p>\n"

      "content_html": "<p>On <a href=\"https://funfact.fm/episodes/9\">an episode of Fun Fact</a> back in March, I shared “one weird trick” for how to be an MC. Listeners seemed to find it helpful, so I wanted to write it up in a more referenceable format:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The trick to MCing an event is to control the silence.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Over the years I have MCed my fair share of conferences, meetups, weddings, and other sundry events. Any article on how to MC an event will orient you to the core requirements pretty quickly:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Tell people what to expect.</li>\n  <li>Keep things moving.</li>\n  <li>Make it fun.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So that’s the idea. But in order to tell your audience what to expect, you need to <em>know what to expect</em>. As such, a lot of MCing (or emceeing if you’re gonna be like that) involves running around collecting and confirming information about shifting plans.</p>\n\n<p>How long is the break? How do you pronounce the next speaker’s name? Is there wifi? Why should we care about the rando you’ve dragged up to give a demo, toast the groom, or extol the countless virtues of immutable value types? The MC has to know what’s coming.</p>\n\n<p>The next level up is about <strong>keeping things moving</strong>. Flow. How can you make this event flow smoothly, steering the audience’s attention to where it needs to be? What’s where the idea of controlling the silence becomes really useful.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"may-i-direct-your-attention\">May I direct your attention</h2>\n\n<p>You see, people are going to want to talk. Socializing is a lot of why people come to events, especially those blowhards way at the back. That’s why you need to make it clear to the crowd when it’s talk time, and when it’s pay-attention time.</p>\n\n<p>If your event is well run, they will have some house music playing in the background before and between presentations. If not, you can often rig background music up yourself. House music is nice for getting folks to start talking to one another.</p>\n\n<p>House music is <em>even nicer</em>, though, for getting people to <strong>stop</strong> talking. When it’s time to intro the next speaker or deliver a status update, just fade out the house music – or, ideally, have a sound tech do this on your signal. The sudden silence will draw everybody’s attention, and your intro blurb (or glib rhetorical question) will shut up the remaining verbal stragglers. You then say your bit, and hand that hard-won energy off to the next speaker by introducing them by name.</p>\n\n<p>The reverse flow happens on the way out: you thank the speaker by name, tell people what to expect next, and then get the house music back on. By controlling the silence – by ensuring there’s only dead air immediately before something interesting is about to happen – you can control the room.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-smooth-handoff\">The smooth handoff</h2>\n\n<p>There are a couple sub-tricks to keeping folks’ attention as an MC. If it’s time for the next presenter and you jump into introducing them, you might realize post-intro that they’re not actually ready. “Oh, uh, I need to get my laptop set up.” Cue 2 minutes of awkward silence as your speaker fumbles around, inwardly panicking, while the audience slowly starts to talk amongst themselves again. Bad MC, bad! By the time things really are ready to go, the energy and attention have been lost to the wind.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, there are two simple ways to prevent a botched handoff:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Check with your next-up speaker if they’re good to go before you get the audience’s attention.</li>\n  <li>If you realize you’ve gotten the audience’s attention too early, and you can’t shuck and jive long enough to fill the gap, just <em>give the attention back.</em> Instead of letting things get awkward, explain that you’ll need a few more minutes and we’ll be going shortly – then get the music back on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>MCing an event isn’t rocket surgery. It does take a bit of practice, but the biggest requirement is simply caring about how things flow, and putting the work in to make them flow well.</p>\n\n<p>Being the steward of an audience’s attention is a privilege. If you treat that attention as a precious resource, then they’ll be willing and ready to give it when you need it.</p>\n"

      "content_html": "<style>\n	.container #content img {\n		clear:both;\n		border-radius: 7px;\n	}\n</style>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, Apple debuted an application for playing music.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, an <em>application</em>. That’s what we called apps back when dinosaurs roamed the Mac. And one of the most-loved applications back in that ancient era was for playing your MP3s. It was called <strong>iTunes</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/og-itunes.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/og-itunes.png\" alt=\"iTunes, circa 2001\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>iTunes brought together a shiny interface and powerful library management that Just Worked™. What we didn’t know in 2001 was that iTunes was the first piece of a “digital hub” strategy that would change Apple forever. From its humble beginnings as a nice way to play music, iTunes quickly became the core of Apple’s push into consumer electronics: first the iPod, and later the iPhone.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/old-restore.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/old-restore.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Two years after its debut, iTunes was already at version 4. The addition of the iTunes Music Store turned a trusty utility into an internet marketplace overnight. The  Store completely overturned the music industry <em>and</em> overturned Apple itself, kickstarting its shift from a computer company to a device and services company.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/hamilton-error.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/hamilton-error.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As fortuitous as this path would be for Apple’s business, the frenzied shoehorning of network and sync features into a large existing codebase – inherited from the aquisition of SoundJam MP – brought about the end of iTunes’ golden era.</p>\n\n<p>Later that year, iTunes arrived on Windows. Apple quickly gained a foothold on millions of Microsoft PCs; a base they could add to every time they had the need to support something across platforms. As penance for this, the iTunes team was sentenced to maintain and add functionality on Windows every time Apple launched a new product or service.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/windows-working.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/windows-working.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And add functionality they did. Over the years, iTunes accumulated features for local music, playing and burning CDs, the iTunes Store, iTunes in the Cloud, iTunes Match, Apple Music, TV, movies, Smart playlists, Genius playlists, podcasts, network library sharing, device backup, internet radio, ratings, iTunes Extras, iTunes U, device software update and restore, media sync, ringtone sync, contact and calendar sync, AirPlay, queueing, Ping, Connect, literally rearranging the icons on your iPhone home screen and – most importantly – displaying a bangin’ visualization of the Hootie and the Blowfish track you just purchased for $0.99.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/could-not-purchase.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/could-not-purchase.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As the central device and platform hub, iTunes became a leaf on the wind of Apple’s strategic moves. The refined focus of the app’s early days gave way to an era of ever increasing complexity and power.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, with great power comes great technical debt. As iTunes became a mammoth katamari of features tangentially related to media, it failed to become a robust front-end for Apple’s increasingly complex network of media services. UI oddities – ranging from weird modal dialogs to an often complete inability to handle network problems – often belied iTunes’ status as a tired legacy product.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/dialog-pile.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/dialog-pile.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Undeterred, Apple marched forward towards streaming music, introducing iTunes Match, iCloud Music Library, and iTunes in the Cloud – which, believe it or not, are three separate things. While Apple’s marketing team may not have struggled to keep up with this growing array of services, iTunes itself certainly did.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/because-an-error.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/because-an-error.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While building the UI for many of these new features using web technology might have been a pragmatic move, it exacerbated iTunes’ struggle to provide a polished and seamless user experience. A move from store pages powered by XML to one fuelled by WebKit never stopped the background drumbeat of glitchiness that often ground the app to a halt.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/500-zero-size.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/500-zero-size.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>By 2015, it was time for a reset. With great fanfare and a remarkable performance by Eddy Cue, Apple Music was born. With Apple Music, the iTunes team was finally given the time and space to fully overhaul the app, ditching 15 years of legacy chaos once and for all.</p>\n\n<p>Just kidding, it was just stuck on top of what was already there.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/apple-music-an-error.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/apple-music-an-error.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Of course, a focused and clean music-only app for Mac is still the endgame. The real question has long been: when?</p>\n\n<p>Retiring iTunes is a hard thing to do, given the wild web of legacy things it enables. Building a ground-up replacement for music on the Mac is a tall order, especially if they wanted to bring across the powerful library management features that made Mac users fall in love with it all those years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Apple must have at least experimented with bringing the much-maligned but generally more modern Music app from iOS to the Mac. Perhaps they could use some kind of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/02/20/gurman-wwdc-2019\">almond-flavoured confection</a> to ease the transition.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, replacing an app the size of iTunes is a big job.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/500-way-too-long.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/500-way-too-long.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>So we waited. The world turned. Users slowly shifted from iTunes to Spotify. A movie came out about a gumshoe Pikachu and it was <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pokemon_detective_pikachu\">somehow not horrible</a>. That is to say, it’s taken a very long time – so long that one might assume there has been a false start or two along the way.</p>\n\n<p>But if the rumour and leak mill is to be believed, iTunes’ end is finally nigh. In macOS 10.15 <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/29/macos-10-15-music-tv-app-screenshots/\">we will finally see a Music.app for Mac</a>. Surprisingly, this new app is said to be based not on the iOS app or a new codebase, but on the venerable iTunes itself.</p>\n\n<p>There will surely be naysayers that claim iTunes should have been tossed entirely. And admittely, if the new Music app ditches iTunes’ interface but can’t cure its deep and baffling love for obtuse modal error dialogs, I too will bemoan its preservation. But arguing for code to be rewritten just because it’s old has never been the right way to build systems that work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/invalid.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/invalid.png\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And whatever the composition and fate of this new app, you really have to hand it to iTunes for getting this far. Seriously, this app has been keeping the beat for almost <em>20 years</em>. It has survived a veritable hurricane of scope creep and strategy taxes. It was a key part of Apple’s growth from charming underdog to singular goliath.</p>\n\n<p>And now, it can finally lay down its burdens and get back to its roots. It can cash out its stock options, and once again be a music app. What better way for a vintage app to spend its retirement?</p>\n\n<p>So let’s pour one out for iTunes. Farewell.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/itunes-not-open-anymore.png\"><img src=\"https://www.allenpike.com/images/2019/itunes/itunes-not-open-anymore.png\" /></a></p>\n\n"
