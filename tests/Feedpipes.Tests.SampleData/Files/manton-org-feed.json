It was just a year ago that I <a href=\"https://inessential.com/2018/08/31/netnewswire_comes_home\">got the name NetNewsWire back from Black Pixel</a> ‚Äî and I thank them again for their wonderful generosity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Each major new version of an app is an opportunity to refocus, and NetNewsWire 5.0 prioritizes all the right things: it&rsquo;s fast, embraces the open web, and feels at home on the Mac. NetNewsWire 5.0 takes everything Brent learned from previous versions, but rebuilt from scratch with modern features like Feedbin syncing, Dark Mode, and JSON Feed support.</p>\n\n<p>And for folks on Micro.blog, NetNewsWire 5.0 also includes a sharing option to start a new microblog post right from an article you&rsquo;re reading in NetNewsWire. It&rsquo;s a great way to quickly share links on your microblog.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/information_operations_directed_at_Hong_Kong.html\">Twitter announced in a blog post</a> that they have removed over 900 fake accounts spreading misinformation about the protests in Hong Kong:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This disclosure consists of 936 accounts originating from within the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC). Overall, these accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground. Based on our intensive investigations, we have reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like that Twitter is being proactive and transparent about this. It&rsquo;s especially remarkable that they notified a competitor, Facebook, about similar fake accounts on Facebook&rsquo;s platform.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there&rsquo;s a deeper problem here. It&rsquo;s not just the fake accounts and misinformation, but the way that Twitter&rsquo;s design can be exploited. It is too easy to piggyback on trending hashtags to gain exposure.</p>\n\n<p>Maciej Ceg≈Çowski of Pinboard <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1162711159000055808\">called attention to the promoted tweets</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every day I go out and see stuff with my own eyes, and then I go to report it on Twitter and see promoted tweets saying the opposite of what I saw. Twitter is taking money from Chinese propaganda outfits and running these promoted tweets against the top Hong Kong protest hashtags</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wrote about this <a href=\"https://manton.org/2018/01/09/books-on-microblog.html\">in 2018</a> when introducing Micro.blog&rsquo;s emoji feature:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hashtags and Twitter trends go together. They can be a powerful way to organize people and topics together across followers. But they can also be gamed, with troublemakers using popular hashtags to hijack your search results for their own promotion or unrelated ranting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve expanded search and discovery in Micro.blog slowly for this reason. While Micro.blog is certainly too small to attract the attention of state-run propaganda, there has been spam going through Micro.blog that no one else sees. I&rsquo;m convinced that limited search, no trends, and active curation are the right foundation so we don&rsquo;t end up with a design that creates problems when Micro.blog does get bigger.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see where Automattic takes Tumblr, but even today there are already several Tumblr-related features built in to Micro.blog. Here are a few ways that Micro.blog can integrate with Tumblr.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Follow Tumblr users on Micro.blog:</strong> Micro.blog tries to play nicely with the rest of the web, so you aren&rsquo;t limited to just following Micro.blog users. To follow someone&rsquo;s Tumblr blog, on Micro.blog click Discover, then click the search icon, and enter their Tumblr domain name:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.manton.org/uploads/2019/e5a65fcc64.png\" alt=\"Tumblr follow\" border=\"0\" width=\"314\" height=\"119\" style=\"width: 314px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Click on the Tumblr user to preview their posts and follow them. Now when they post to their blog, those posts from Tumblr will appear in the Micro.blog timeline. Short posts, photo posts, and art from Tumblr look great in Micro.blog.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Add your Tumblr feed to Micro.blog:</strong> If you actively post to Tumblr and also have a Micro.blog account, you can add your Tumblr RSS feed to Micro.blog so that when someone follows you on Micro.blog, they see posts from both your main microblog and your Tumblr blog.</p>\n\n<p>Click Account ‚Üí Edit Feeds &amp; Cross-posting, then paste in your Tumblr RSS feed:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.manton.org/uploads/2019/4c645b39b7.png\" alt=\"Tumblr feed\" border=\"0\" width=\"564\" height=\"111\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Import your Tumblr blog to Micro.blog:</strong> Maybe you no longer maintain your Tumblr blog and want to move your old posts over to Micro.blog. First, export your posts from the Tumblr dashboard. That will give you a .zip file you can import into Micro.blog under Posts ‚Üí Import.</p>\n",

				"id": "http://manton.micro.blog/2019/08/13/tumblr-and-appnet.html",
				"title": "Tumblr and‚Ä¶ App.net",
				"content_html": "<p>Thanks to the &ldquo;on this day&rdquo; feature <a href=\"https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories\">that Jonathan LaCour built</a> for Micro.blog-hosted blogs, I noticed that 7 years ago yesterday <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2012/08/12/appnets-great-start.html\">I blogged about App.net reaching their funding goal</a>. I still get asked about App.net sometimes. It is easy to look back on something that didn&rsquo;t last and pick it apart. I&rsquo;d rather look at the good things that came out of App.net.</p>\n\n<p>When it was shutting down, I blogged <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2017/01/06/thank-you-to.html\">my thanks to the App.net community</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.manton.org/2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html\">I wrote in 2013</a> that it was not just a Twitter clone but an <em>amplifier</em> for applications that couldn‚Äôt be built before. It came along at the right time, took off, and then faded. The App.net founders deserve significant credit and thanks for trying something risky and succeeding to grow a community that lasted so long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a guiding principle in Micro.blog that differentiates it from nearly every other platform. It&rsquo;s not only about creating an alternative social network. The foundation is around blogs and IndieWeb standards because that&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://manton.org/2018/09/07/the-way-out.html\">part of unrolling the damage caused by massive silos</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Micro.blog is also designed around blogs because it gives immediate value to the platform, insulating it against the network effect that drives the success or failure of most other social networks: not all your friends are there yet. Unlike ad-supported platforms, Micro.blog aligns its business model with customer needs. Subscriptions for blog hosting let us deliver the best features we can, and also help support the rest of the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Brent Simmons really <a href=\"https://inessential.com/2018/02/01/why_micro_blog_is_not_another_app_net\">said it best</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Micro.blog is not an alternative silo: instead, it‚Äôs what you build when you believe that <em>the web itself</em> is the great social network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I often look back at this quote to help guide me as I evaluate the direction of Micro.blog. I believe that Micro.blog is the first platform of its kind. The closest competition might be Tumblr, <a href=\"https://photomatt.tumblr.com/post/186964618222/automattic-tumblr\">acquired yesterday by Automattic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Of course it was coincidence that Automattic acquired Tumblr pretty much exactly 7 years after App.net was funded. No one is paying attention to those dates. And yet, now that I&rsquo;ve noticed it, there&rsquo;s a kind of symbolism to it. Tumblr is effectively being re-funded.</p>\n\n<p>Like Micro.blog, Tumblr is about making blogging easier. Like Micro.blog, Tumblr allows custom domain names for your blog, something no other major social network allows. Unlike Micro.blog, however, Tumblr&rsquo;s community is only Tumblr blogs. Micro.blog&rsquo;s community brings together not just Micro.blog-hosted blogs, but people using WordPress, Mastodon, or home-grown IndieWeb solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg and the Automattic team have a bunch of work ahead of them to integrate Tumblr into the WordPress ecosystem. I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s going to play out, but I know that preserving all the Tumblr blogs and giving them new life <em>is a good thing</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if Micro.blog and Automattic are on parallel tracks. Two companies wildly different in size and scope, but we can all learn from platforms that have come and gone, finding our own path to a shared vision of the future that embraces content ownership, supports healthy communities, and deemphasizes massive social networks. I&rsquo;m wishing the team at Automattic the best.</p>\n",

Just a download number for each episode under Posts on the web, next to the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; buttons. You can enable it with a checkbox from Posts ‚Üí Design. Micro.blog is not tracking the downloads until you enable it, and it doesn&rsquo;t count you viewing your own podcast, so initially there won&rsquo;t be anything to see until your podcast feed is refreshed and your MP3s are downloaded again.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.manton.org/uploads/2019/0083c70856.png\" alt=\"Micro.blog stats screenshot\" border=\"0\" width=\"472\" height=\"54\" /></p>\n\n<p>With this setting enabled, Micro.blog modifies your podcast feed to use different MP3 download URLs. It may take some time before the new URLs make it to all your listeners.</p>\n\n<p>Micro.blog&rsquo;s download tracking does not closely follow the <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/guidelines/podcast-measurement-guidelines/\">IAB guidelines</a> yet. It is intended as a rough estimate. I&rsquo;ll be working toward IAB compliance in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Happy podcasting! Let me know if you have any feedback.</p>\n",
