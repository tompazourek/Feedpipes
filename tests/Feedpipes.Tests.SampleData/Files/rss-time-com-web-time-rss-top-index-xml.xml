								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-5641038"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5641038/democratic-debate-flint-voters/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>As the Democratic presidential candidates <a href="https://time.com/5639337/biden-harris-booker-democratic-debate/" >prepared to debate</a> in Detroit Wednesday night, the dozen voters who gathered to watch in the cinderblock auditorium of the Flint Development Center some 70 miles away weren&#8217;t focused on the candidates or the polls. Nobody was talking about Senator Kamala Harris or former Vice President Joe Biden as they chatted over a meal of fried chicken and spaghetti provided by Black Voters Matter, the advocacy group that hosted the watch party. Instead, they talked about public school funding, an issue which barely came up on stage in Detroit. For 10 minutes after the debate&#8217;s scheduled 8 p.m. start time, the organizers didn&#8217;t even turn on the TV.<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>Black voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/us/politics/black-voters-south-carolina-democrats-primary.html"  target="_blank">make up about 20%</a> of the Democratic vote nationwide, and they are an increasingly critical component of the party&#8217;s electoral coalition. Because they often vote as a bloc, the Democrat who carries black voters usually wins the nomination. On Wednesday three candidates in particular were vying for their support: Biden, who has community support because of his partnership with President Obama; Harris, who has sought to build a base of black women; and Senator Cory Booker, the former mayor of Newark, N.J., who has emphasized criminal-justice reform. A <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3635"  target="_blank">Quinnipiac poll</a> released Monday found Biden leading with support from 53% of black voters, with all of his opponents trailing in the single digits.</p>
<p>But the voters sitting on folding chairs watching the debate didn&#8217;t necessarily seem pulled towards any of them. Between Harris, Biden, and Booker, no clear favorite emerged. Instead, these Flint voters seemed drawn to candidates like businessman Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. In interviews, they seemed simultaneously overwhelmed with their choices and bored by their options. During the roughly 40-minute stretch of the debate that focused on the policy minutiae underpinning various Medicare for All plans, many of the voters were scrolling on their phones.</p>
<p>Even the issues that campaigns suspected would pique their interests didn&#8217;t seem to galvanize the crowd. A long back-and-forth between Biden, Booker, and Harris on their respective criminal-justice records drew only a muted response. Despite heated online debates about criminal justice, nobody in the Flint room volunteered opinions about Biden&#8217;s 1994 crime bill, or Harris&#8217;s time as a prosecutor, or Booker&#8217;s criminal justice reform bill.</p>
<p>Amber Hassan, a 38-year old Flint hip-hop artist, said she wasn&#8217;t particularly impressed with any of the front-runners on Wednesday night. &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for Kamala Harris to represent everyday black women,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about PhD black women, I&#8217;m talking about everyday, middle America, regular struggles black women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biden, she added, &#8220;feels entitled to it, there&#8217;s an air of &#8216;I&#8217;ve kind of got this in the bag, I&#8217;ve done this before,'&#8221; she said. &#8220;No, you haven&#8217;t done this before: you&#8217;ve been the assistant.&#8221; Booker, she said, didn&#8217;t seem &#8220;authentic.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Hassan said she was intrigued by &#8220;the blonde woman&#8221;&mdash;meaning Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who talked during the debate about how, as a white woman, she could be a messenger to her peers about matters like white privilege. And she was drawn to Yang: &#8220;I liked that he was a little more relaxed. He didn&#8217;t have a tie on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, these voters responded best when the candidates involved the challenges facing their community in Flint. They nodded when Booker argued that Trump won Michigan partly because of the suppression of black voters. They cheered when Yang pointed out that &#8220;we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan.&#8221; They clapped when Gabbard suggested redirecting trillions of dollars away from &#8220;wasteful regime change wars&#8221; and towards &#8220;making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the skepticism towards the establishment ran deep, especially in a community that has been as failed by elected leaders as badly as Flint has. They were unimpressed by lip service that didn&#8217;t come with an infrastructure plan or a promise of increased funding. &#8220;Everybody uses us, because it looks good,&#8221; said Shanta Smith, 43, who runs a Flint substance abuse facility. &#8220;They&#8217;ll drive through Flint, they&#8217;ll touch on it, but what are you really doing for Flint?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith came to the debate thinking he wanted to hear from Harris or Booker, but found herself listening closely to Yang. &#8220;He was really talking about real issues, not just attacking and playing the politics game. He had his math together,&#8221; said Smith. &#8220;He&#8217;s not the usual candidate.&#8221; Other voters at the watch party agreed: in an informal poll conducted after the debate, Yang won overwhelmingly.</p>

<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Some voters did voice support for the big names. &#8220;Kamala impressed me right out the gate because our community needs somebody who is in touch,&#8221; said Michele Kelly, 60. She liked Booker too, she said, because he lived in a low-income community in Newark. &#8220;You don&#8217;t do that for show,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you go and live in low-income housing, that means you love the people who are there.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Some voters said that if nobody captures their trust, they may not vote at all. Amber Hassan, who calls herself a &#8220;selective voter,&#8221; says choosing between two imperfect candidates is like choosing between &#8220;dirty lettuce or rotten lettuce,&#8221; and she&#8217;d rather walk away with nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been lied to so many times,&#8221; says Lendra Brown, 59, a former food stamp manager. If she had to vote tomorrow, she says, &#8220;I would vote for Mickey Mouse.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-5641475"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5641475/burger-king-impossible-whopper/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Next week, Burger King&#8217;s signature whopper will have a new rival: the Impossible Whopper. In a partnership with <a href="https://time.com/5247858/impossible-foods-meat-plant-based-agriculture/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impossible Foods</a>, Burger King will rollout the meatless, plant-based burger patty in its restaurants across the U.S. on August 8.</p>
<p>The burger, which was made to taste exactly like the original whopper, has been added as a limited-time offering on the menu, and costs $5.59, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/business/impossible-whopper-national/index.html"  target="_blank">CNN reported</a>. Chris Finazzo, Burger King&#8217;s President for the Americas told CNN that they are monitoring the meatless burger&#8217;s performance before making it a BK staple.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Burger King i<a href="https://time.com/5562488/burger-king-meatless-burger/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">nstituted a test run</a> of the Impossible Whopper in 59 stores throughout St. Louis, MO, to great success. According to data analytics done by inMarket inSights, stores in St. Louis that had the Impossible Whopper option experienced <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2750857/Reports_Whitepapers_Webinars/inMarket%20inSights:%20Burger%20King%20Impossible%20Burger%20Report%20Card.pdf?__hstc=116666969.f11e88bb65d0b3c35beb2f0254809cb3.1564668486478.1564668486478.1564668486478.1&amp;__hssc=116666969.1.1564668486478"  target="_blank">16.5% higher foot traffic</a> than the March average. Across the US, there was an average increase of 18.5% in foot traffic at these locations compared to other Burger King restaurants.<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>In an email, Rachel Konrad, Chief Communications Officer at Impossible Foods, says that the Impossible Whopper rollout had &#8220;unquestionably&#8221; raised the demand for their product. &#8220;The Impossible Burger is a unique product in that the more you&#8217;re aware of it and the more it&#8217;s available, the more you order it everywhere you go,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>It is<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> not just the vegetarians who seem enticed by the Impossible Whopper option. In a </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/238328/snapshot-few-americans-vegetarian-vegan.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&amp;g_medium=NEWSFEED&amp;g_campaign=item_&amp;g_content=Snapshot%3a%2520Few%2520Americans%2520Vegetarian%2520or%2520Vegan" style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"  target="_blank">Gallup Poll from Aug. 2018</a><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, research shows that only 5% of Americans identify as vegetarians&mdash; a number which has stayed relatively stable since 1999. Only 3% reported following a vegan diet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">So why are people so interested in the meatless burger? </span>The Impossible Burger is not just a vegetarian option, it&#8217;s also an <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/if-pr/LCA-Update-2019/"  target="_blank">environmentally friendly</a> one. The company&#8217;s product reduces use of water, land and greenhouse gas emissions in the creation of its burgers. &#8220;It&#8217;s just plants doing the Impossible,&#8221; their website says.</p>
<p>But despite all the excitement surrounding the Impossible Burger, one concern lies with the company&#8217;s ability to meet the growing demand for its meat-free products. Impossible Foods is privately owned, so no production numbers are available, but even the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/business/impossible-foods-burger-demand.html"  target="_blank">New York <em>Times</em></a> has noted that the company&#8217;s supply can fall short of demand. In June, the New York <em>Post</em> <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/26/impossible-burger-is-running-dangerously-low-on-supply/"  target="_blank">wrote</a> that the burger was &#8220;running dangerously low on supply.&#8221; The company currently services thousands of restaurants across the U.S. including White Castle, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18507925/qdobas-impossible-meat"  target="_blank">Qdoba</a>, Burger King and <a href="https://www.redrobin.com/burgers/impossible-burger.html"  target="_blank">Red Robin</a>. Konrad says that they are continuing to expand their reach to more restaurants, and will be introducing the Impossible Burger in grocery stores next month.</p>
<p>I<span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">n July, Impossible Foods issued another </span><a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/media/news-releases/" style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"  target="_blank">press release</a><span style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> announcing a partnership with the OSI Group, which it dubs &#8220;one of the largest food producers in the world.&#8221; They hope that this joint venture will allow for increased manufacturing capacity to &#8220;help satisfy scorching demand.&#8221; Konrad explains that the deal with OSI will, &#8220;quadruple production capacity by the end of 2019. So there should be plenty of Impossible Burger to meet short-term demand.&#8221;</span></p>

		<title>Relatives of Gangster John Dillinger Say They Have ‘Evidence’ That Prompted Request to Exhume Body</title>

				<description><![CDATA[They also claim FBI agents possibly killed someone else in 1934]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-5641947"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5641947/john-dillinger-relatives-evidence-exhume/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>(INDIANAPOLIS) &mdash; Two relatives of notorious 1930s gangster John Dillinger who plan to have his remains exhumed as part of a television documentary say they have &#8220;evidence&#8221; the body buried in an Indianapolis cemetery may not be him and that FBI agents possibly killed someone else in 1934.</p>
<p>The FBI immediately disputed that idea, calling it a &#8220;myth&#8221; that its agents didn&#8217;t fatally shoot Dillinger outside a Chicago theater more than 85 years ago. The agency said in a statement that &#8220;a wealth of information supports Dillinger&#8217;s demise&#8221; including fingerprint matches.</p>
<p>But in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6231099-Dillinger-affidavit.html"  target="_blank">affidavits released</a> by the Indiana State Department of Health, two relatives of the famed criminal say they&#8217;re seeking to have &#8220;a body purported to be John H. Dillinger&#8221; exhumed from Crown Hill Cemetery for a forensic analysis and possible DNA testing.<br />

<p>The planned exhumation will be part of a documentary on Dillinger for The History Channel, a spokesman for A&amp;E Networks confirmed earlier this week.</p>
<p>Mike Thompson and Carol Thompson Griffith, who say Dillinger was their uncle, wrote in affidavits supporting an exhumation and reburial permit the state agency approved in July that they have received &#8220;evidence that demonstrates that the individual who was shot and killed at the Biograph Theater in Chicago on July 22, 1934 may not in fact have been my uncle, John H. Dillinger.&#8221;</p>
<p>In their affidavits, both say that &#8220;evidence&#8221; includes that the eye color of the man killed outside that theater didn&#8217;t match Dillinger&#8217;s eye color, his ears were shaped differently, the fingerprints weren&#8217;t a match and that he had a heart condition. The document doesn&#8217;t elaborate on why the heart condition supports their theory that the man wasn&#8217;t Dillinger.</p>
<p>But both say they want the body exhumed and subjected to a forensic analysis and possibly DNA testing &#8220;in order to make a positive identification.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my belief and opinion that it is critical to learn whether Dillinger lived beyond his reported date of death of July 22, 1934. If he was not killed on that date, I am interested in discovering what happened to him, where he lived, whether he had children, and whether any such children or grandchildren are living today,&#8221; both say in the documents.</p>
<p>The Chicago Sun-Times and WLS-TV in Chicago first reported on the affidavits supporting the exhumation permit.</p>
<p>A&amp;E Networks spokesman Dan Silberman said Thursday that he only learned this week about the relatives&#8217; affidavits and their belief that Dillinger might not be buried in the grave.</p>
<p>He said he can&#8217;t comment on the planned documentary or what the film&#8217;s focus will be because the project hasn&#8217;t gone into production yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really early in the process,&#8221; Silberman said. &#8220;In documentaries, it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a script, so it&#8217;s hard to say at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said no date has been scheduled for the exhumation and approvals are still needed from other government entities. Silberman said he did not know if Dillinger&#8217;s relatives would be paid by the network as part of the documentary.</p>
<p>The FBI took the unusual step of issuing a statement late Wednesday insisting that its agents had in fact shot and killed Dillinger &#8220;as he reached for a pistol from his trouser pocket&#8221; outside the theater.</p>
<p>The FBI said Dillinger was pronounced dead at a Chicago hospital. The agency also said that it&#8217;s a &#8220;common myth&#8221; that &#8220;a stand-in&#8221; and not Dillinger was the man killed, saying that such claims &#8220;have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another Dillinger relative said he considers the planned exhumation to be disrespectful. Great-nephew Jeff Scalf tells WTHR-TV that he&#8217;s certain the late gangster is buried in the concrete-encased grave that&#8217;s marked with his name at the cemetery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in desecrating the dead. I think it&#8217;s been 85 years. It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; Scalf told the Indianapolis station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless somebody was successful in robbing the grave, that&#8217;s John. I know that that&#8217;s John,&#8221; added Scalf, who&#8217;s a cousin of Mike Thompson, one of the relatives who sought the state permit.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis-born Dillinger, who was portrayed by Johnny Depp in the 2009 movie &#8220;Public Enemies,&#8221; was one of America&#8217;s most notorious criminals. The FBI says Dillinger&#8217;s gang killed 10 people as they pulled off a bloody string of bank robberies across the Midwest in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Dillinger was considered a folk hero by some during the Great Depression, when banks foreclosed on homes and farms amid the economic crisis, said Susan Sutton, a historian with the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
<p>Dillinger was awaiting trial in the slaying of an East Chicago police officer when he escaped from jail in Crown Point, Indiana, in March 1934 with a gun carved out of wood. While on the run, he underwent plastic surgery to alter his face and was said to have tried to remove his fingerprints with acid.</p>
<p>Months later, Dillinger was fatally shot outside Chicago&#8217;s Biograph Theater after he was betrayed by a woman who became known in newspapers as the &#8220;Lady in Red.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dillinger&#8217;s family feared that vandals might dig up his body, Sutton said, citing a 2013 book the historical society published about the Indianapolis cemetery&#8217;s history, &#8220;Crown Hill: History, Spirit, and Sanctuary.&#8221; Days after his funeral, Dillinger&#8217;s father had his son&#8217;s casket reburied under a protective cap of concrete and scrap iron topped by four reinforced-concrete slabs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dillingers had actually been offered money to &#8216;lend out&#8217; his body for exhibits, so they were concerned,&#8221; Sutton said Tuesday.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[A blood-based test could identify Alzheimer’s disease earlier, which could give patients a better chance of slowing or eventually preventing the brain disease]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-5641602"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5641602/blood-test-may-be-up-to-94-accurate-in-finding-people-with-alzheimers-brain-changes/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>More than a century after Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease was first described, there<a href="https://time.com/5341036/bill-gates-alzheimers-disease-research/" > still isn&rsquo;t a treatment</a> to control the cognitive decline and memory loss that are the hallmarks of the neurodegenerative condition. The drugs that are available can alleviate some of the disease&rsquo;s symptoms, but don&rsquo;t work to address the root cause of the brain disease. And recent studies of promising drug therapies have<a href="https://time.com/5557060/alzheimers-drug-aducanumab-trial-patient/" > failed to show much benefit</a> for patients.</p>
<p>One challenge in developing a treatment for Alzheimer&rsquo;s lies in that by the time symptoms occur, brain neurons have already been damaged, perhaps beyond repair. And once neural connections are compromised, they aren&rsquo;t likely to reform or rebuild. Drug treatments that start after people report declines in their thinking skills may simply be too little too late.<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s strong interest in developing a reliable way to identify Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients as early as possible, years or even decades before their memories start to fade. Researchers are investigating a number of promising markers that appear in the blood that could be useful in tracking Alzheimer&rsquo;s. Some of the most encouraging of this work centers on amyloid, the protein that is the hallmark of the disease. Current methods of testing for amyloid, including taking samples of cerebrospinal fluid and PET imaging of the brain, are expensive, time consuming and, in the case of the spinal fluid samples, invasive. That limits the number of people who get tested; having a blood test would potentially allow more people at risk of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s to learn of their status.</p>
<p>Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis report in the journal <em>Neurology</em> that they have developed such a blood test that may be up to 94% accurate in finding people with early Alzheimer&rsquo;s brain changes. They had previously reported the results at the<a href="https://www.alz.org/aaic/2019_media_coverage.asp?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=google_grants&amp;utm_content=aaic&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIna_lvP7h4wIVg56fCh00TghDEAAYASAAEgIRPvD_BwE"  target="_blank"> Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association International conference</a> in July, and it&#8217;s among the most advanced efforts to bring a blood-based test to the clinic.</p>
<p>While everyone makes amyloid, in some, the protein is produced in abnormally copious amounts that clump together and form plaques in the brain, which experts believe start to strangle nerves and sever their critical connections to each other. Having amyloid plaques in the brain is a requirement for an Alzheimer&rsquo;s diagnosis, so the researchers developed a test that could pick up amyloid levels in the blood.</p>
<p>The team, led by senior author Dr. Randall Bateman, professor of neurology, and first author Dr. Suzanne Schindler, associate professor of neurology, documented the ratio of two fragments of amyloid protein, called a-beta 42 and a-beta 40 to each other; the fragments form when the parent protein is normally chopped by enzymes. In people who develop Alzheimer&#8217;s, however, for some reason the resulting fragments start sticking together, and aren&#8217;t cleared from the brain. As more amyloid aggregates in the brain to form plaques, less of it, particularly a-beta 42, is available to circulate in the blood, so the ratio of the two forms to each other is a proxy for how much is being pulled into clumps in the brain. The lower the ratio, the more plaques are forming in the brain.</p>
<p>To detect the circulating amyloid, researchers used mass spectrometry, a technique that separates out compounds in a sample by vaporizing them and then shooting them with an electron beam to create specific ionic signatures that identify specific molecules or proteins. The technique can record the amount of a-beta 42 and a-beta 40 from a blood sample.</p>
<p>In this study, the team took samples from 158 people over the age of 50, most of whom were cognitively normal at the start of the study, and followed them for about four years to see which participants developed Alzheimer&rsquo;s. To verify the amyloid levels found in the blood test, the volunteers also had a PET scan of their brains and provided samples of cerebrospinal fluid, near the start and then again near the end of the study period.</p>
<p>The blood samples were collected within 18 months of the first amyloid PET scan, and 88% of the time, the blood test matched the scan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not accurate enough to use as a test to identify people at-risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s, so the team then combined the blood test with other well-known risk factors, such as the presence of a genetic factor called ApoE4, and age. When these additional factors were considered, the combination matched the PET scan 94% of the time.</p>
<p>Previous efforts, including one by a group of Japanese researchers, to develop a blood test have compared the blood results to PET imaging, but for the first time, the Washington University researchers also tracked the blood test and PET scan results over time. They found that people who had negative amyloid PET scans at the start of the study but positive amyloid blood tests had a 15-fold higher risk of having a positive PET scan by the end of the study.</p>
<p>In other words, the blood test may be picking up very early changes in amyloid, that weren&#8217;t detectable on the brain scans. &ldquo;Typically, with a one-time reading, we would have called those people false positive on the blood test and said it was a failure of the test,&rdquo; says Schindler. &ldquo;But the test wasn&rsquo;t a failure, and those weren&rsquo;t false positives but rather the blood test was more sensitive than the amyloid PET in picking up early changes of Alzheimer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schindler says the test is not perfect yet, and needs more refinement and validation in larger groups of patients. But the research team has already worked with other patients in Australia and Europe and found similarly accurate results.</p>
<p>Using the blood test in a doctor&rsquo;s office to identify those at the highest risk of developing brain changes linked to Alzheimer&rsquo;s may still be a few years away. But Maria Carillo, chief science officer at the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association, says that in the immediate future, the test could be a huge help in ensuring that the right patients&mdash;those with higher levels of amyloid&mdash;are taking part in trials of new drug treatments for the disease.</p>
<p>Big questions about a blood test for detecting Alzheimer&rsquo;s still remain, including how experts will set the threshold for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;high&rdquo; levels of amyloid or other proteins in the blood. Making such a determination will be &ldquo;complicated,&rdquo; says Schindler, since while the presence of amyloid is necessary for an Alzheimer&rsquo;s diagnosis, not everyone who harbors amyloid plaques necessarily develops the disease. But having a reliable way to track changes in people&rsquo;s amyloid levels would be a start.</p>

<p>Fortnite superstar Tyler &#8220;Ninja&#8221; Blevins has left Twitch and is taking his video game live streams to Microsoft&#8217;s Mixer platform, a stunning switch that could have wide-ranging consequences for the rapidly growing industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ninja/status/1156970023421915136?s=20"  target="_blank">Ninja announced his move Thursday</a>, ending a hugely profitable partnership with Twitch, a live streaming giant owned by Amazon.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for the opportunities Twitch has provided me,&#8221; Ninja told The Associated Press. &#8220;But as I looked at the next step in my career, I wanted to be somewhere that empowered me to push the boundaries of gaming and achieve bigger goals within the industry. Mixer provides me with more ways to connect with my community.&#8221;<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>Ninja has earned millions broadcasting himself playing Fortnite and other video games on Twitch and YouTube. He has over 14 million followers on Twitch, and the platform has hosted many of his pioneering esports moments, including a Fortnite event in March 2018 featuring rappers Drake and Travis Scott and football player JuJu Smith-Schuster that propelled the game into a full-blown cultural phenomenon.</p>
<p>Ninja will host his first Mixer live stream Friday from Lollapalooza, a four-day music festival in Chicago. The 28-year-old has publicly invited Kyle &#8220;Bugha&#8221; Giersdorf &mdash; the 16-year-old who earned $3 million Sunday for winning the inaugural Fortnite World Cup &mdash; to join him. Blevins said he will not actively recruit other gamers to leave their current platform, but if more streamers follow him to Mixer, it could become a legitimate competitor in a market dominated by Twitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want my friends to make their own decisions for what platforms they choose to play on,&#8221; Ninja said. &#8220;With that being said, I will welcome anyone with open arms who wants to join me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement to the AP, Twitch said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve loved watching Ninja on Twitch over the years and are proud of all that he&#8217;s accomplished for himself and his family, and the gaming community. We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mixer launched in 2016 but hasn&#8217;t nearly matched Twitch&#8217;s popularity &mdash; Microsoft reported 10 million monthly users last year, compared to well over 100 million for Twitch, which launched in 2011. Mixer has been praised for its interface and its management of toxic players, though, and Ninja said he expects to connect to fans with &#8220;more interactivity and variety than before&#8221; because of Mixer&#8217;s technological abilities &mdash; for example, streamers can share their controller with fans, and the chat function has a greater array of features. Ninja also anticipates the deal with Mixer will free him up to do more live events and other non-streaming content.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love what I do and will still be actively streaming and continuing to interact with my fans,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With Mixer, I get to further engage with the tools on the platform, which I am excited about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within 40 minutes of the announcement, Mixer was the top trending topic on Twitter in the United States, and Ninja&#8217;s Mixer page had over 28,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Ninja first emerged in the streaming community eight years ago while playing Halo. After some competitive success with battle royale games H1Z1 and PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds, he broke into the mainstream as the face of Fortnite last year. He&#8217;s the most followed gamer on Twitch, although his popularity has slowed. He ranked fourth in hours watched on the platform in June, about 6 million hours behind Turner &#8220;Tfue&#8221; Tenney, according to StreamElements.</p>
<p>Ninja routinely broadcasts with other pro gamers, including friends Ben &#8220;DrLupo&#8221; Lupo, Jack &#8220;CouRage&#8221; Dunlop and Tim &#8220;TimtheTatman&#8221; Betar. He&#8217;s been criticized for not inviting more female players into his streams, and that intensified when he told Polygon last year that his concern was &#8220;if there&#8217;s a hint of flirting, that is going to be taken and going to be put on every single video and be clickbait forever.&#8221; Blevins married in 2017.</p>
<p>Ninja said that at Mixer, &#8220;I will do my part to ensure I am helping to create a fun and welcoming community,&#8221; and that includes playing with female gamers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will play with any gamer who loves gaming as much as I do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ninja has famously had his wife, Jessica, manage his business during his gaming career, but he&#8217;s expanded the operation by adding Loaded management group and law firm Loeb &amp; Loeb. That team is banking that Blevins&#8217; immense fan base will follow him to a new platform. Mixer streams online and also via Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox consoles, and Fortnite is popular on the Xbox, which should help. Loaded CEO Brandon Freytag believes Blevins&#8217; clout will bring fans to Mixer, calling him &#8220;the Michael Jordan of gaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are working toward Tyler being synonymous in every household, so if you know gaming, you know Tyler,&#8221; Freytag said.</p>
<p>The move to Mixer is one of a few changes for Ninja this year. He&#8217;s also attempting to branch beyond the digital space, starting by authoring three books that will be published later this year, including a how-to on streaming video games and a graphic novel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the ability to achieve bigger goals in gaming and further expand my own personal brand within the industry,&#8221; Ninja said.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The bill passed by a 67-28 vote in a bi-partisan effort to finalize the deal]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-5641866"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5641866/senate-budget-debt-deal-passed/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>(WASHINGTON) &mdash; A hard-won budget and debt deal easily cleared the Senate on Thursday, powered by President Donald Trump&#8217;s endorsement and a bipartisan drive to cement recent spending increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies.</p>
<p>The legislation passed by a 67-28 vote as Trump and his GOP allies relied on lots of Democratic votes to propel it over the finish line.</p>
<p>Passage marked a drama-free solution to a worrisome set of looming Washington deadlines as both allies and adversaries of the president set aside ideology in exchange for relative fiscal peace and stability. The measure, which Trump has promised to sign, would permit the government to resume borrowing to pay all its bills and would set an overall $1.37 trillion limit on agency budgets approved by Congress annually.<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>It does nothing to stem the government&#8217;s spiraling debt and the return of $1 trillion-plus deficits but it also takes away the prospect of a government shutdown in October or the threat of deep automatic spending cuts.</p>
<p>The administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., played strong hands in the talks that sealed the agreement last week, producing a pragmatic measure that had much for lawmakers to dislike.</p>
<p>Trump did step back from a possible fight over spending increases sought by liberals, and he achieved his priorities on Pentagon budgets and the stock market-soothing borrowing limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Budget Deal is phenomenal for our Great Military, our Vets, and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!&#8221; Trump tweeted before the vote. &#8220;Two year deal gets us past the Election. Go for it Republicans, there is always plenty of time to CUT!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelosi won remarkable Democratic unity in pushing the bill through the House last week despite divides on issues such as impeachment and health care.</p>
<p>Democrats in the GOP-controlled Senate delivered most of their votes for the deal. Many of the more solidly conservative Republicans said it allowed for unchecked borrowing and too much spending.</p>
<p>The measure was an epitaph to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which came about due to a tea party-fueled battle over debt limit legislation during the run-up to President Barack Obama&#8217;s re-election. That law promised more than $2 trillion in deficit cuts through 2021, including automatic spending cuts that were put in place after the failure of a so-called deficit supercommittee.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just Democrats. Republicans are also guilty. At least the big-government Republicans who will vote for this monstrous addition of debt,&#8221; said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. &#8220;Many of the supporters of this debt deal ran around their states for years complaining that, &#8216;President Obama&#8217;s spending too much and borrowing too much,&#8217; and these same Republicans now, the whole disingenuous lot of them, will wiggle their way to the front of the trough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill would lift the debt limit for two years, into either a second Trump term or the administration of a Democratic successor.</p>
<p>It would reverse scheduled 10 percent cuts to defense and nondefense programs next year, at a two-year cost of more than $200 billion. An additional $100 billion over two years would add to recent gains for military readiness, combating opioids and other domestic initiatives, and would keep pace with rising costs for veterans&#8217; health care.</p>
<p>Those increases alone, assuming they are repeated year after year, promise to add $2 trillion or more to the government&#8217;s $22 trillion debt over the coming decade.</p>
<p>The bill was powered by a coalition of GOP defense hawks, Democrats seeking to preserve gains in domestic accounts, and the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Democrats voted for the bill by a wide margin, and it won a healthy majority of Senate Republicans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing sufficient funding for our military and eliminating the threat of sequestration for good are absolutely necessary for our military to have the budgetary stability and predictability they so desperately need,&#8221; said the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.</p>
<p>It was also a long-sought victory for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who initiated the negotiations and was deeply invested in bringing order and relative predictability to the budget and debt deadlines.</p>
<p>Losers included more conservative elements of the White House. Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, a former tea party congressman from South Carolina, and acting budget director Russell Vought were rebuffed in attempts to add spending cuts to defray the bill&#8217;s cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to invest in improved readiness to help our military commanders plan for emerging challenges, in research and development to support the U.S. military of the future, and in rock-solid support for our alliance commitments,&#8221; McConnell said. &#8220;This deal is an opportunity to do exactly that. This is the agreement the administration has negotiated. This is the deal the House has passed. This is the deal President Trump is waiting and eager to sign into law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., a longshot candidate for president, accused Republicans of financial hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first came here in 2009, Republicans railed against the rising debt and federal spending, even as our economy reeled,&#8221; Bennet said. &#8220;Remarkably, they seemed to have forgotten their supposedly principled calls for fiscal discipline now that President Trump is in office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Follow-up legislation would fill in the line-by-line details of agency budgets when the Senate returns in September. Trump is sure to continue seeking billions of dollars for border security and wall construction, but unlike last year he does not appear eager for a government shutdown over it.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[President Trump Threatens New 10% Tariff Products From China From September 1]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-5641813"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5641813/trump-tariffs-china/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>(WASHINGTON) &mdash; President Donald Trump intensified pressure Thursday on China to reach a trade deal by saying that beginning Sept. 1, he will impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports he hasn&#8217;t already taxed. The move immediately sent stock prices sinking.</p>
<p>The president has already imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products, and Beijing has retaliated by taxing $110 billion in U.S. goods.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers are likely to feel the pain if Trump proceeds with the new tariffs. Trump&#8217;s earlier tariffs had been designed to minimize the impact on ordinary Americans by focusing on industrial goods. The new tariffs will hit a vast range of consumer products from cellphones to silk scarves.<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>The president&#8217;s action came as a surprise, just as U.S. and Chinese negotiators were concluding a 12th round of what the White House called &#8220;constructive&#8221; trade talks in Shanghai. The negotiations ended Wednesday without any sign of a deal but are scheduled to resume next month in Washington.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up nearly 300 points earlier, was down nearly 200 points soon after Trump&#8217;s tweets announcing the new tariffs.</p>
<p>Trump has long said he was preparing to tax the $300 billion in additional Chinese tariffs. But he suspended the threat after meeting with President Xi Jinping in Osaka, Japan, in June.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t clear when American consumers are likely to feel the impact of the additional tariffs, but higher prices could show up in stores this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attention all Target &amp; Wal-Mart shoppers &#8230; the price on the goods you buy ahead of the holidays are going up due to trade policy,&#8221; tweeted Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultancy RSM.</p>
<p>Trump also tweeted that &#8220;we look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive Trade Deal, and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one!&#8221;</p>
<p>The president blamed China for not following through on stopping the sale of fentanyl to the United States or purchasing large quantities of farm goods such as soybeans.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s two biggest economies are locked in a trade war over U.S. allegations that Beijing uses predatory tactics &mdash; including stealing trade secrets and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology &mdash; in a drive to overtake American technological dominance.</p>
<p>Talks had broken down in May after the United States accused the Chinese of reneging on earlier commitments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, these talks are not getting any easier,&#8221; said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect the Chinese to sit by &#8230; The combination of these latest tariffs, with Chinese counter retaliation, is going to take a heavy toll on US consumers, workers, farmers, and businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The effects of Trump&#8217;s trade war were a factor in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decision Wednesday to cut interest rates in an otherwise healthy economy. Chairman Jerome Powell pointed repeatedly to the uncertainty caused by Trump&#8217;s pursuit of trade wars on multiple fronts as a reason for the rate cut.</p>
<p>Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed board member, and other economists have warned that the rate cut could embolden Trump to escalate trade battles because the president may feel confident that the Fed will then respond with additional rate cuts.</p>

<p>(PHILADELPHIA) &mdash; The Philadelphia Police Department says seven officers whose Facebook posts were flagged in an investigation into offensive and sometimes threatening social media activity have resigned.</p>
<p>Last month, the department suspended 13 officers with an intent to fire them after a nonprofit group published the results of a review of personal Facebook posts or comments from officers in Philadelphia and seven other police departments.</p>
<p>The researchers found officers from Arizona to Florida bashing immigrants and Muslims, promoting racist stereotypes, identifying with right-wing militia groups and glorifying police brutality. All of the posts were public.</p>
<p>Capt. Sekou Kinebrew <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-police-facebook-richard-ross-firings-terminations-plain-view-project-20190801.html"  target="_blank">tells the Philadelphia Inquirer</a> he can&#8217;t say whether the seven who resigned were among those set to be fired.</p>
<p>The police officers&#8217; union didn&#8217;t comment on the resignations.</p>
<p>It previously said it was disappointed the officers would &#8220;be terminated without due process.&#8221;</p>

<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5640494/why-you-need-to-make-a-when-i-die-file-before-its-too-late/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>Ruth Byock, 81, was driving to her daughter Molly&rsquo;s house for Thanksgiving dinner when she had a heart attack and died. Struggling to imagine a world without their mother, Molly and her brother Ira went to clear out her condo in Leisure World, the retirement community in Laguna Woods, CA that Ruth had called home for 12 years. (She had renamed the place &ldquo;Wrinkle Village&rdquo;).</p>
<p>While sorting through her things, they discovered a small card file on a kitchen counter next to her recipe box. They opened it up, expecting guidance on how to make brisket and kugel. (On the afternoon she died, she had two versions of the baked noodle dish in the back seat of the car.)<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>What Molly and Ira found instead took them by surprise: Inside, their mother had carefully organized all of her papers, including the account numbers, pending transactions, and a bundle of other documents they&rsquo;d need to settle her affairs and distribute her belongings. It was as though their mother had baked them one last batch of kugel from beyond and left it waiting there for them to arrive. &ldquo;This was not a Buddhist master&rsquo;s awareness of death,&rdquo; Ira Byock says. &ldquo;It was a Jewish mother&rsquo;s love for her children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Ruth had compiled was what we call a &ldquo;When I Die&rdquo; file, and it may be the single most important thing you do before you depart. It may sound morbid, but creating a findable file, binder, cloud-based drive, or even shoebox where you store estate documents and meaningful personal effects will save your loved ones incalculable time, money, and suffering. Plus, there&rsquo;s a lot of imagination you can bring to bear that will give your When I Die file a deeper purpose than a list of account numbers. One woman told us she wants to leave her eulogy for husband in the file, so she can pay homage to him even if she goes first.</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s card file box didn&rsquo;t make it any easier for the Byock children to say goodbye to her, but it did make handling the material aftermath of her life a lot easier. If you&rsquo;ve never had to do such a thing, spoiler alert: When someone you love dies, shutting down his or her life can take a year or more. When my father contracted pneumonia and died after years of living with dementia, my sister and I had little insight into the particulars of his life. He&rsquo;d been organized enough to get his will and trust signed and notarized in his late 60s, but those documents only told part of the story. We had no idea where to find the prenuptial he assured us he&rsquo;d written when he remarried five years before he died or how to unlock his phone and computer to find contact info for friends and colleagues we knew would want to be at his memorial.</p>
<p>Instead, we ended up sleuthing through his file cabinet and mail and requesting what seemed like a mountain of duplicate death certificates to prove to various companies that he had actually died. (Make sure to order a dozen copies from the funeral home at the outset, as they&rsquo;ll be required to close everything&mdash;including social media accounts.) It was an agonizing process that took us nearly two years to complete, including hiring a woman who runs estate sales to hawk his belongings&mdash;even the multivitamins and sardine tins in his pantry found buyers!&mdash;and sell the house.</p>
<p>Another spoiler: Like my sister and I, your kids probably don&rsquo;t want your stuff. They&rsquo;ve read Marie Kondo and are trying to rid their own prolific lives of clutter. Sentimental items, especially small ones, are glorious exceptions to this rule. But stuff for the sake of more stuff is no favor.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s some good news: there is much you can do right now that will make your &ldquo;When I Die&rdquo; file simpler for you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>First, call the companies behind your cable, internet, cell phone, club memberships, and anything else that bills for services on an ongoing basis and add your partner or kids to the account as a joint owner. If billing accounts are not in both your and a loved one&rsquo;s name, your survivors will end up spending hours on the phone and in offices begging bureaucrats to shut them down or convert the accounts to their name so they can manage them. Think of every frustrating call you&rsquo;ve had with your cell provider, and then multiply it by 10.</p>
<p>Think you&rsquo;re too young to worry about any of this? Can&rsquo;t find the time? It always feels too soon. Only one third of Americans have completed even a basic advance healthcare directive&mdash;the document that asks you to elect a health care agent who can speak for you if you end up in the hospital and can&rsquo;t speak for yourself. But you don&rsquo;t have to pull your When I Die file together overnight. Maybe focus on one item per month for the next year. Gathering a whole death file together will make you a highly advanced American and a family hero.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the things you&rsquo;ll put into your &ldquo;When I Die&rdquo; file:</p>
<p>&#9633; An advance directive that&rsquo;s signed (and notarized if necessary)</p>
<p>&#9633; A will and living trust (with certificate of trust)</p>
<p>&#9633; Marriage or divorce certificate(s)</p>
<p>&#9633; Passwords for phone, computer, email, and social media accounts</p>
<p>(We recommend using an online password manager to collect them all, sharing the master password with someone you trust, and then designating emergency contacts within the program who are allowed to gain access.)</p>
<p>&#9633; Instructions for your funeral and final disposition</p>
<p>&#9633; An ethical will</p>
<p>&#9633; Letters to loved ones</p>
<p>There are thirteen more things you might want to include in a living will that we detail in our book, <em>A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to the End</em>. That&rsquo;s twenty items in all, but don&rsquo;t be intimidated&mdash;most of them will be easy to collect. The last two items&mdash;an ethical will and letters to loved ones&mdash;may be the most meaningful and the hardest to pull off, so let&rsquo;s talk about those.</p>
<p>Where a legal will transfers assets, an ethical will transfers immaterial things: your life lessons and values. The practice dates back over 3,500 years to Jacob, who orally delivered the first one to his sons, according to the Old Testament, admonishing their bad behavior and giving tips on how to do better.</p>
<p>An ethical will is a complement to your will, not a replacement. &ldquo;I like to say it&rsquo;s your values alongside your valuables,&rdquo; says Dr. Barry Baines, the author of <em>Ethical Wills: Putting Your Values on Paper</em> and a hospice medical director in the Twin Cities. It can act as the explainer for why you made certain choices in your legal will. One couple we spoke to decided they didn&rsquo;t trust their siblings enough to raise their children should they die, so when they wrote a will and trust, they assigned guardianship of the kids to close family friends. Knowing that revealing this decision would hurt the feelings of their sisters and brothers, they decided to explain it in an ethical will instead.</p>
<p>Creating an ethical will for your When I Die file doesn&rsquo;t have to be a big deal. It can consist of things you&rsquo;re already doing&mdash;collecting quotes you like, or journal entries.</p>
<p>And if that feels like too heavy a lift, try simply writing a letter to someone you love as a way of leaving a few last words. Frish Brandt started transcribing such letters while volunteering with a local hospice agency. People liked the service she provided, so she set up Lasting Letters (mylastingletters.com) to offer the service more broadly.</p>
<p>I directed my letter to my 12-year-old daughter, Cleo. I didn&rsquo;t know how to start, so Brandt prompted me: &ldquo;What would you want to say to Cleo if you couldn&rsquo;t tell her in person?&rdquo; Things I hadn&rsquo;t planned to say started gushing out of my mouth. It felt like there was a football in my throat and I had to stop a few times, but when it was over, Brandt took 10 minutes to transcribe her notes on what I&rsquo;d said and read them back to me in the form of a letter.</p>
<p>I printed it out, folded it up, and slipped it into the file where my husband and I keep our When I Die file. I felt huge relief in knowing that it was there for my daughter to discover (though she&rsquo;ll likely read it in our book first) and I&rsquo;ll be curious to see how the letters to my children shift as I get closer to death.</p>
<p>The point of all this is to make a difficult thing like dying or loving someone who is dying less difficult. In that sense, creating a When I Die file is an act of love, It will always be too soon to tell your story and let people know how much they mean to you, until it is too late.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<aside class="right-rail__container right-rail__container--ad"><div class="right-rail__ad__wrapper right-rail__module"><div class="right-rail__ad" id="right-rail__ad-5641752"></div></div><br />
<div class="OUTBRAIN right-rail__outbrain right-rail__module" data-src="https://time.com/5641752/ebola-death-toll-congo/" data-widget-id="SB_2" data-ob-template="timemag"></div></aside>
<p>(KINSHASA, Congo) &mdash; The 1-year-old daughter and the wife of the man who died of Ebola in Congo&#8217;s city of Goma this week have tested positive for the disease, health officials confirmed Thursday, while Rwanda briefly closed its border with Congo over the virus outbreak that now enters its second year.</p>
<p>It is the first transmission of Ebola inside Goma, a city of more than 2 million people on the Rwandan border, a scenario that health experts have long feared. The painstaking work of finding, tracking and vaccinating people who had contact with the man &mdash; and the contacts of those contacts &mdash; has begun.<br />
<div class="article-video ad_brightcove_video right-rail-adjacent"><div id="ad_brightcove" class="ad_brightcove_video-wrapper"></div></div></p>
<p>The man died on Wednesday after spending several days at home with his large family while showing symptoms. Congo&#8217;s presidency said the entire family was at &#8220;high risk&#8221; and in quarantine. The Ebola coordinator for North Kivu province, Dr. Aruna Abedi, confirmed the wife&#8217;s case to The Associated Press hours after that of the child.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing the first active transmission chain in Goma and expect more to come,&#8221; the International Rescue Committee&#8217;s Ebola response director, Andre Heller, warned in a statement.</p>
<p>This outbreak has killed more than 1,800 people, nearly a third of them children. It is now the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, and last month the World Health Organization declared it a rare global emergency.</p>
<p>Rwanda&#8217;s state minister for foreign affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe confirmed the border closure, a day after WHO officials praised African nations for keeping their borders open. Last week Saudi Arabia stopped issuing visas to people from Congo while citing the Ebola outbreak, shortly before the annual hajj pilgrimage there this month.</p>
<p>Congo&#8217;s presidency condemned Rwanda&#8217;s decision, and Congolese at the busy border expressed frustration. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why they don&#8217;t just test us instead of closing these borders,&#8221; said Angel Murhula, who works in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Several hours later Congo&#8217;s presidency said the border had reopened. A Rwanda health ministry statement called the events a &#8220;traffic slowdown&#8221; as surveillance for Ebola was reinforced. The ministry advised against unnecessary travel to the Goma area.</p>
<p>WHO has recommended against travel restrictions amid the outbreak but says the risk of regional spread is &#8220;very high.&#8221; Any border closure is likely to push people to avoid formal immigration posts. In June, three people who crossed on an unguarded footpath into Uganda died there before their family members were taken back to Congo for treatment.</p>
<p>The death on Wednesday in Goma &#8220;in such a dense population center underscores the very real risk of further disease transmission, perhaps beyond the country&#8217;s borders,&#8221; United Nations agencies said in a joint statement marking a year of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The man in his 40s was a miner returning from an area of northeastern Ituri province, Mongwalu, where no Ebola cases in this outbreak have been recorded, WHO said. He was exposed to the virus along the roughly 300-mile-long (490-kilometer) route from Komanda to Goma as he took motor taxis over a number of days through the densely populated region at the heart of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The man arrived in Goma on July 13 and started showing symptoms on July 22. He was isolated at an Ebola treatment center on Tuesday. He had spent five days being treated at home and then went to a health facility, where Ebola was suspected. Symptoms can start to occur between two and 21 days from infection, health experts say.</p>
<p>&#8220;He may not even have been aware of the exposure that he had,&#8221; WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said on Wednesday. Symptoms such as fever can be confused with malaria, which is endemic in the region.</p>
<p>Congo&#8217;s new Ebola response coordinator, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, has said there appears to be no link between the case and the previous one in Goma that was announced two and a half weeks ago. That case was a 46-year-old preacher who managed to pass through three health checkpoints on the way from Butembo, one of the communities hardest hit by this outbreak.</p>
<p>The declaration of a global health emergency &mdash; the fifth in history &mdash; came days after that first Goma case. It has brought a surge of millions of dollars in new pledges by international donors, but some health workers say a new approach is needed to combat misunderstandings in a part of Congo that had never experienced Ebola before.</p>
<p>Health workers responding to the outbreak have been attacked, even killed, in a region where rebel groups are active and the population is wary of outsiders.</p>
<p>There is no licensed treatment for Ebola, which is spread by close contact with bodily fluids of those infected, and survival can depend on seeking treatment as quickly as possible. And yet many people in the region don&#8217;t believe that the virus is real, health workers have said.</p>
<p>This outbreak is second only to the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that left more than 11,300 people dead.</p>
