				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trying to find the best bingo sites among a sea of options can be tough, especially with new brands popping up on the regular. With the result, it&#8217;s hard to determine which bingo sites are safe to play at and which ones are simply rogue. If you’re looking for a broad selection of the most trusted operators, you can check out <a href="https://www.newbingosites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="exclude">NewBingoSites.net</a> for regular bingo site updates. Keep reading to find out how you can refine your search and ensure that you only play on fair, licensed and regulated platforms.</p>
<h3>Legality</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55094" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/selecting-safe-new-bingo-sites.jpg" alt="selecting safe new bingo sites" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/selecting-safe-new-bingo-sites.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/selecting-safe-new-bingo-sites-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The very first order of business is checking out the legality of online gambling in your country. It is important to research before signing up at any bingo platform as your country may have laws prohibiting this sort of activity. When it comes to the UK though, playing bingo online is perfectly legal for anyone over the age of 18. The government enforces strict regulations on gambling operators to ensure a fair and safe environment. Another useful bit of information is that the UK government does not tax gambling wins.</p>
<h3>Licensing and Regulation</h3>
<p>Next is making sure that the bingo site is regulated and licensed by an authorised online gambling body. For example, for UK platforms the regulatory body must be licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. You may also want to check out if the bingo site is licensed by a country on UK&#8217;s white list of gambling jurisdictions. These countries include Alderney, Antigua, Barbuda, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, and Tasmania. Having a legitimate license in place ensures that the bingo platform is fair and safe.</p>
<h3>Check the T&amp;Cs</h3>
<p>Be sure to read the bingo site terms and conditions carefully. Generally, these should be transparent, fair and easily understood. If you have any questions about the site’s legitimacy, reaching out to the customer support via telephone, email, or live chat, should provide you with the answers you need.</p>
<h3>Wagering Requirements</h3>
<p>Always check the wagering requirements when it comes to <a href="https://www.newbingosites.net/bingo-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="exclude">bingo bonuses</a> and withdrawal policies. A good idea is to cross-check this information with other operators to ensure that you are choosing the best possible site for you. Wagering requirements are simply a set of rules that define how many times you&#8217;ll need to wager your deposit or bonus funds before you cash out any winnings.</p>
<h3>Payment Methods</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55095" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/payment-for-new-bingo-sites.jpg" alt="payment for new bingo sites" width="600" height="430" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/payment-for-new-bingo-sites.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/payment-for-new-bingo-sites-400x287.jpg 400w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/payment-for-new-bingo-sites-586x420.jpg 586w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When it comes to withdrawing and depositing funds into your bingo account, be sure to check which payment methods are available to UK players. Boku, Neteller, Skrill, Ukash and credit and debit card options tend to be the more favoured in UK and each bingo site&#8217;s banking methods will vary. Trusted payment methods also ensure that your funds will remain completely safe due to encryption technology.</p>
<h3>Player Reviews</h3>
<p>Finally, it is important to see what others think of a particular online bingo site. You can read player reviews and check their comments to gain a good user perspective on things.<br />
Remember to keep these key elements in mind when choosing a safe bingo site to prevent falling prey to fraudulent operators. With online bingo becoming more popular each year, the question is: are all these sites to be trusted? Do your research and know the facts to find the perfect platform for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Space-saving kitchen organizing tips are helpful in creating space where you can cook, wash, and complete your other tasks in the kitchen easier and faster. Below are some of the best tips you can try today.</p>
<h3>Use Your Space Above the Window</h3>
<p>If the distance between the kitchen windows and the ceiling above them is large enough for extra storage, you can create a shelf and store things there. Use the space to keep things you don&#8217;t use that often, such as cake or fruit platters and vases.</p>
<p>To make a shelf organically fit into the window frame or the kitchen design, paint it the same color and observe proportions towards the size of the window opening.</p>
<h3>Let the Shelves Float</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55068" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kitchen-organizing-tip.jpg" alt="kitchen organizing tip" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kitchen-organizing-tip.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kitchen-organizing-tip-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>If there&#8217;s not enough space to create storage above the window, give attention to the free spot on both sides of the window. Remodel and install some floating shelves there. Don’t worry if space is too narrow for storage because you can attach several shelves, placing them one above the other.</p>
<p>Their total number can reach up to 6 or 8. You can even have 10 if the window is long and the ceiling of your kitchen is high.</p>
<h3>Attach a Pot Rack</h3>
<p>The space above the cooker could be a problem for storage because it’s hard to hang some shelves or a cupboard there without blocking access to a stove hood. However, you can create sufficient space by installing a pot rock. You can place pans, ladles, and other kitchen utensils you often need for cooking.</p>
<h3>Make a Grid of Woven Boxes</h3>
<p>Some people think that extra storage and other functionality can compromise style.</p>
<p>If you’re sure that too many drawers will make the kitchen look like a tipped-over hamper, take into consideration woven storage baskets with/without lids. You can place them on open shelves.</p>
<p>Modern-looking models can be easily bought from stores or created based on what you want. Don’t forget to attach tags or stickers to remember where anything is.</p>
<h3>Hang Cups</h3>
<p>While building shelves above the tabletop in order to get extra storage, fit that space with a steel or copper crossbar to hang cups and mugs. It can also be furnished along the walls under the cupboards. It’s one of the most straightforward and cheap storage tips you can use.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s a good storage idea for drying the cups after they’ve been washed. If the metal or copper color of the pipe disrupts the harmony of the kitchen interior, paint the crossbar with your preferred color.</p>
<h3>Get a Classic Etagère</h3>
<p>When you need good storage spaces, think of an étagère. It can be designed as a factory or a handmade piece of furniture either from steel or wood. Its height will depend on the distance between the floor/tabletop and the ceiling. You can use it as both food and dishes storage.</p>
<h3>Use Swing Stools</h3>
<figure id="attachment_55067" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-55067" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/swing-stools.jpg" alt="swing stools" width="600" height="406" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/swing-stools.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/swing-stools-400x271.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Via Pinterest</figcaption></figure>
<p>Swing stools are a valuable kitchen storage idea since it helps save space efficiently. Their seat can be made of different materials according to your preferences.</p>
<p>For example, wood is versatile and fits both vintage and high-tech interiors. This material is usually furnished under the kitchen table. You can make them disappear when not in use. High-quality steel attachments allow the stool to slide easily.</p>
<h3>Make Inner Racks</h3>
<p>The inner surface of your cupboard often remains neglected. However, it is a great kitchen storage idea if you want to save space or hide such dangerous tools, like knives from children.</p>
<h3>Get a Drop-Down Tray for Mobile Devices</h3>
<p>This tray is a great storage idea since it allows you to keep a tablet, smartphone or even a laptop nearby. Its mechanism is straightforward but if you don&#8217;t know much about carpentry, you can order it without hurting your wallet.</p>
<p>These kitchen organizing tips can help save space in your kitchen. They can help make cooking faster and you won&#8217;t have to waste time looking for things you need. Besides, they let you hide expensive, dangerous, and fragile things so they&#8217;re not accessible to pets and kids.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is waking up early in the morning and traveling a long way to workout making you feel lazy?</p>
<p>If yes, then you are not alone.</p>
<p>There are many gym goers who will agree with this fact. However, laziness is not the only factor that stops people from going to a gym. Cost also influences decisions when it comes to continuing a gym membership.</p>
<p>If somewhere in your mind, you are struggling with the same thoughts as above, then it may be the time to start creating a home gym.</p>
<p>Yes, you heard it right! No matter your fitness goals, working out at home to reduce carb or get fit is a great way to avoid expensive gym membership. It sounds great for all the busy moms as they can be at home, take care of their kids, and also focus on achieving their fitness goals.</p>
<p>However, wait before purchasing yoga mats or a treadmill and think about the exercises that keep you fit. Then, figure out how much area is required to set the different gym equipment. After having a clear vision of everything, you can create your gym at home.</p>
<p>To help you fulfill the dream of having a private home gym, here are some tips to consider.</p>
<h3>Create a Space That Motivates You</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55063" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym.jpg" alt="creating home gym" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym-80x60.jpg 80w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym-265x198.jpg 265w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym-560x420.jpg 560w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym-80x60@2x.jpg 160w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/creating-home-gym-265x198@2x.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>What if you have a sun-drenched space where you can do cardio while watching the kids? It feels like a booster and gets you one step closer towards achieving a fitness goal. You can turn an empty corner or any small room just big enough for your kind of training.</p>
<p>Even a spare bedroom can become a yoga retreat by adding some yoga essentials. Also, having a mirror helps you exercise right and minimize injury. We can say that the mirror is an excellent substitute for a personal trainer.</p>
<h3>Decide Your Budget and Plan Further</h3>
<p>One of the famous entrepreneurs said, &#8220;The best way to stick to your budget is to start one.&#8221; So, before you set up your home gym, establish a budget. Think about your area of investment, what you want to achieve, and what fits the best in the space you created.</p>
<p>If you want fully equipped fitness space, then invest in the equipment&#8217;s quality that won&#8217;t break your budget. It is not compulsory to buy expensive gym equipment. There are options for every budget. For instance, instead of a multigym system you can buy a set of benches with a raiser.</p>
<h3>Choose The Equipment Wisely</h3>
<p>Skip the expensive and heavy fitness equipment if you are not sure of using it. According to a study, most of the people who have treadmills or stationary bikes end up using them for hanging clothes or handbags. So, think twice before buying any equipment.</p>
<p>You can rent any tool that best fits your fitness targets. Once you have decided on buying a gym machine, examine all features, design, and safety. The instrument should be easy to use and operate smoothly. Shop for the one with the best features and benefits as quality is more crucial when it comes to health!</p>

<h3>Make a Schedule for the Week</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55062" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/create-a-home-gym.jpg" alt="create a home gym" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/create-a-home-gym.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/create-a-home-gym-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Planning is essential when you want to see results. Plan for your actions! Consider which fitness exercise you will do on a particular day. Even the best gym in your home will not provide results if you are not exercising.</p>
<p>Create a schedule for the week to never miss a workout. Keep your plan realistic and keep it simple, so it never demotivates you on workouts. Also, you can keep track of your progress. Finally, when the day arrives to exercise, never step back, do it with full force.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Whatever your space or budget, if you have a desire, then you can totally start creating a home gym. This guideline is the ultimate source to balance your daily routine lifestyle plus fitness goals. It covers essential tips that will help you build your gym at home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Experiencing back pain can lead to many potential problems. For example, back pain can limit your motion, stopping you from performing certain activities. In addition, living with chronic back pain can take a toll on your mental health, contributing to conditions like depression. Thankfully, there are multiple things you can do to start easing back pain.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of your options below.</p>
<h3>Use Ice or Heat Packs</h3>
<p>Often, back injuries can be accompanied by swelling in the muscles. This can cause discomfort, making those areas more sensitive.</p>
<p>For this reason, consider using either an ice or heat pack on the injury. Generally, it’s recommended that you use ice packs for the first 48 hours after the injury. You can switch to heat packs later.</p>
<p>This is because ice can reduce inflammation and swelling. The heat packs, on the other hand, can relax your muscles, providing an effective form of pain relief.</p>
<h3>Consider Changing Your Sleeping Technique</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55056" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-ease-back-pain.jpg" alt="how to ease back pain" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-ease-back-pain.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-ease-back-pain-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When we sleep, it’s important that our bodies get the support that they need.</p>
<p>A good mattress will ensure that your spine gets the support that you require, making it easy for you to maintain a good posture. There are a few signs that can tell you if you need to replace your mattress.</p>
<p>First, if you no longer wake up feeling refreshed, the mattress might no longer be providing enough support. In addition, if the mattress is over eight years old, the springs and padding might be worn out. The longer that you sleep on an unsupportive mattress, the worse your pain will become.</p>
<p>You should also consider the way that you sleep to ensure your spine is in the correct alignment. For example, people who sleep on their side should think about placing pillows between their knees. Alternatively, people who prefer to sleep on their back might want to consider placing a pillow under their knees.</p>

<h3>Stretch</h3>
<p>Learning some effective stretches might be one of the best ways to work on easing back pain. This can increase your flexibility, take the pressure off of your muscles, and help improve your posture.</p>
<p>Though there are multiple stretches available online, try to find dynamic options. A dynamic stretch incorporates movement and is based on yoga techniques. For example, you can lie on your back with your heels on the floor and your knees bent.</p>
<p>Then, move one knee towards your chest, holding it there for around 30 seconds. Repeat with the other knee.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/yoga-before-bed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Top 10 Yoga-Before-Bed Poses to Reduce your Back Pain</a></strong></p>
<h3>Use An Inversion Table</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to relieve back pain might be with using an inversion table. This device allows you to position yourself at a downward angle, usually for around 15 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>This will help you strengthen your spine and improve your posture. This will also provide pain relief by removing the pressure on your back.</p>
<p>In addition, this is considered a very safe way of relieving back pain. You can purchase these devices online.</p>
<p>How can you be sure you are choosing the best inversion table?</p>
<p>There are a few factors that you should consider when looking for the best table for your needs. First, it should have a heavy-duty steel frame. This will ensure that it will last for a long time.</p>
<p>You might also want to check any weight restrictions that the device might have. In addition, look for an inversion table that allows you to choose the angles you use.</p>
<h3>Avoid Back Braces And Quit Smoking</h3>
<p>There are a few negative practices that might be contributing to your back pain. While it can be tempting to wear a back brace to reduce the amount of pressure on your spine, this isn’t recommended.</p>
<p>This is because you will be weakening the muscles in your back. This will increase your reliance on the brace, increasing the pain you experience when it is removed.</p>
<p>In addition, you should stop smoking. When you smoke, toxins are released into the bloodstream. For this reason, studies have shown that people who smoke are more likely to experience back pain.</p>
<h3>Use Relaxation Techniques</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55055" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ease-back-pain.jpg" alt="ease back pain" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ease-back-pain.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ease-back-pain-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Back pain takes a toll on your mental health and has been linked with conditions like depression. Sadly, the worse these mental health conditions become, the more severe the pain experienced gets.</p>
<p>This can be a very destructive cycle for people who experience chronic pain. Thankfully, they can use relaxation techniques to get into a better headspace.</p>
<p>For example, meditation can be used to focus the mind, distracting you from your back pain. Alternatively, you can try tai chi, deep breathing or yoga. These exercises have been shown to reduce the amount of pain you experience.</p>
<h3>Try Different Shoes</h3>
<p>Finally, you might want to consider replacing your footwear. If your shoes aren’t correct, it may place an additional strain on your neck, shoulders, and back. This can lead to your body being put out of alignment.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should avoid wearing high heels. In addition, you should avoid wearing flat shoes and opt for ones that have small heels. You might want to consider visiting a podiatrist to find the best fit for your feet.</p>
<p>Back pain is a common occurrence, affecting around 80 percent of the population. Thankfully, there are some effective methods that you can use to reduce your pain.</p>
<p>For example, your sleeping position and the best inversion table might both lower your discomfort levels. However, if you continue to experience back pain, you might want to consult a doctor.</p>
<p>Back pain can be an indicator of several medical issues which shouldn’t be ignored. So, manage your pain more effectively today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost everyone goes through a phase of depression in life. Some people are lucky enough to break free from this illness while others find it challenging. Majority of people, however, spend their entire lives fighting and coping with depression naturally.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Depression</a> is a common illness. The person you work with every day may be going through stress disorders. Your colleague that smiles every day could be going through a dark time in his life.</p>
<p>Putting on a happy face does not qualify you as a happy person. If you see a person exhibiting any signs of depression, you should immediately try and help him out.</p>
<p>Most people start taking antidepressants to cope with their sadness. While these medicines do help for some time, they are not a permanent solution to the problem. The only way you can beat depression is by naturally treating the root cause, avoiding triggers, and leading a healthy life.</p>
<p>Depression does not come alone. After a while, the patient starts suffering from physical symptoms as well. These symptoms include headaches, chest pains, nausea, dizziness, exhaustion, mood swings, and insomnia.</p>
<p>If you are fighting anxieties in your life, here are some tips on coping with depression naturally.</p>
<h3>Try Therapy</h3>
<p>The first thing any person with depression should do is seek help. There is no harm in asking for help and it is never too late to do that.</p>
<p>Professional help will always be better since an expert therapist is capable of dealing with the condition. He can provide advice and counseling. A lot of people find therapy fruitful and are helpful in pulling them out from their depression.</p>
<p>Your therapist can also give you tips on how to handle your thoughts as everybody has his own demons.</p>
<h3>Avoid Triggers</h3>
<p>Depression is something that doesn’t really go away; it is always there. However, there are times and phases during which you may find the depression to be at its worst.</p>
<p>These are the times that are more dangerous as they make you vulnerable to all actions and thoughts. Some people get a panic attack which makes it harder for them to breathe.</p>
<p>The solution is to find the triggers or stressors. These are the things that worsen your anxiety. Once you identify them, you need to make sure that you avoid them.</p>
<h3>Eat Healthy Food</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55051" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coping-naturally-with-depression.jpg" alt="coping naturally with depression" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coping-naturally-with-depression.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coping-naturally-with-depression-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Eating habits also affect your body and brain. Eating processed food, drinking alcohol, and smoking cigarettes are not just wrong for your body physically but they also release chemicals that add to your depression.</p>
<p>The best way to internally fight your stress hormones is by eating foods that are healthy to help boost your mood. This is a scientifically proven fact. The right types of food can help you feel better and happier.</p>
<p>Omega 3s have shown to be promising antidepressants as well. They are a better replacement for pharmaceutical drugs since they have no side effects.</p>

<h3>Fix Your Sleeping Schedules</h3>
<p>Sleeping on time may not cure your depression at once, but it&#8217;s one brick in the wall.<br />
Your depression can start innocently with lack of sleep.</p>
<p>If your routine does not allow you to have 8 hours of sleep every night, it means that your brain is not getting enough rest. Lack of sleep leads to anxiety and stress and that can contribute to your depression.</p>
<p>Depression, in turn, causes insomnia. In short, it is a toxic cycle that needs to be broken.</p>
<p>Sleeping on time and waking early in the morning are things every person with depression should try and do. Getting enough sleep is not the only thing important. It is necessary that the sleep you get occurs at night or else you won’t wake up fresh and energetic.</p>

<h3>Go Out For a Walk/Do Exercise</h3>
<p>Make a habit of going out every morning for 15 to 20 minutes. There are a few benefits of going outside in the early morning. You are able to get fresh air which can distract you from your daily stress.</p>
<p>Going out on a walk is a good workout for your body. The blood circulation improves and your organs and muscles get adequate oxygen.</p>
<p>If you want to take it up a notch, you should start doing exercises. It could include a workout routine that is not that intense but gets your body moving.</p>
<h3>Socialize</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55050" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coping-with-depression.jpg" alt="coping with depression" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coping-with-depression.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/coping-with-depression-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Depression can cause you to feel isolated. You don&#8217;t feel like going out or meeting with people. You need to do the exact opposite of that!</p>
<p>While staying in and skipping on a party can seem like the right thing to do, it is not. It can only make you feel worse. The more you surround yourself with friends and family, the more you will be able to distract your mind. Staying in on your own can only cause you to overthink and that leads to further stress.</p>
<p>Dress up and have fun with your friends. Plan a movie night or go out shopping. If you think that staying alone makes your depression worse, then you should definitely spend more time with your friends.</p>
<h3>Self-Care</h3>
<p>A day of self-care will never hurt you. In fact, you will end up feeling more loved and refreshed.</p>
<p>A lot of times, the stress of daily life can be overwhelming. It can be the stress of office work, an upcoming exam or a personal issue. These things can get to you and make you feel stressed out. The perfect way to step back is by going to a spa.</p>
<p>We recommend spending a whole day in a spa because it is a complete package. There is massage involved along with a hot bath and mani-pedi. These are considered as physical therapies that can calm down your nerve and relax your body muscles.</p>
<p>A day of self-care will restart your body, enabling you to handle the challenges in a better way.</p>
<p>Coping with depression naturally can start with these helpful tips! Stay safe!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last few days, I have been feeling way too sleepy. That could be because the weather is fantastic where I live or I am overeating (I just ordered Mexican food from Chili’s) or both. The point is I am a solopreneur, a freelancer. I am in the phase of scaling up my business and feeling sleepy at two o&#8217; clock in the afternoon is not something I can afford.</p>
<p>I have too much on my plate at the moment. For starters &#8211; I want to get my website up and running. Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it will be live by the time you read this article. My husband and I have family visiting us, so there&#8217;s that. We are traveling a bit too much in the coming months, so we have to plan for that.</p>
<p>And these are just non-work related tasks. There are assignments to be scheduled for the clients I signed up recently, and articles to be delivered before the month gets over.</p>
<p>Too much to do. Too little time.</p>
<p>These days, by the time I look up after finishing one assignment, it&#8217;s already nighttime and I can&#8217;t help but wonder if there is a way to break this productivity slump and complete all the tasks on my to-do list faster.</p>
<p>To answer my own question, I usually follow these eight nifty tips to staying productive. Check them out:</p>
<h3>Write even when I don&#8217;t want to</h3>
<p>Since a significant part of my job revolves around writing, I can&#8217;t escape it even when I want to. I have deadlines to meet and some critical clients who I can&#8217;t disappoint. Therefore, whenever I feel lazy or unproductive, I write. The output may not be as good, but I still get the job done. And, that&#8217;s what matters at the end of the day!</p>
<h3>Talk to a friend or colleague</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55021" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stay-productive.jpg" alt="stay productive" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stay-productive.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stay-productive-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>I am lucky to have a few friends from the same industry. I get on weekly calls with them to discuss our goals and challenges. Sometimes, I have a casual call with them. It&#8217;s nice to know what they are up to besides work, which can often get boring.</p>
<p>When I am feeling low, I prefer speaking to a select few &#8211; the ones that make me laugh. My conversations with them put me back in the right place, and I can put things in perspective, professionally and personally.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know how much good vibes of a person can rub off on you.</p>
<h3>Take a stroll in the park</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t do this often, but just going for a walk calms me and helps me readjust my focus. I really enjoy the weather here, so it&#8217;s great stepping out in the evenings. I try to walk for 30 minutes every day. Walking increases cardiovascular fitness, improves balance, reduces body fat, among other benefits.</p>
<h3>Stay away from social media</h3>
<p>When you are unproductive, don&#8217;t make it worse by browsing through your Instagram feed. Believe it or not &#8211; it is not the first thing I check right in the mornings anymore. I go on Twitter while I am working, but that too is controlled.</p>
<p>I was never a huge fan of Facebook and can go days without checking it. I am a bit active on LinkedIn, but really, it can&#8217;t and doesn&#8217;t do much harm. In the last year, if there&#8217;s anything that I have learned is that social media can suck your time and energy.</p>
<p>Worse, it can make you feel guilty, useless, and incredibly low by the end of the day. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that.</p>

<h3>Listen to music</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55022" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-stay-productive.jpg" alt="how to stay productive" width="600" height="385" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-stay-productive.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-stay-productive-400x257.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>I love listening to music. Sometimes I put on ambient music to remove all distractions while researching or writing. Hans Zimmer, anyone? And then, there are times when I want to listen to SZA, The Weeknd or Post Malone.</p>
<p>Music has a way of filling my surroundings with substance. It lifts my spirits and makes me very happy. The right type of music makes me want to dream big, achieve big, and live my life to the fullest! I hope your experience is similar.</p>
<p>P.S. I am listening to Unforgettable by French Montana and Swae Lee right now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/how-music-affects-your-productivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">How Music Affects Your Productivity</a></strong></p>
<h3>Have some chai</h3>
<p>I am a North Indian, and we thrive on chai. When I was working in an office, my friend and I would wait to go on a tea break. Now that I work from home, the charm of companionship may be lost, but hey, I still have my chai. Evenings are meant to be enjoyed with freshly brewed tea.</p>
<p>I feel I deserve a steaming cup after a hectic day. Don&#8217;t we all?</p>
<p>I am also a fan of green tea but I feel that&#8217;s an acquired taste. I recently bought Blue Pea green tea from Tea Trunk. It has a beautiful azure hue &#8211; a visual delight indeed! I like the dull taste too &#8211; balanced and calming &#8211; just how I want it.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Any type of tea breaks my productivity slump.</p>
<h3>Finish off household work</h3>
<p>I love my house, and I like it to be nice and proper. Whether it is folding laundry or cooking &#8211; I like to make sure I am at the top of things. This attitude is specifically handy during such dull days, when I still want to do something substantial.</p>
<p>When I know I have got one chore off my list, I know I can write an article or finish scheduling social media for a week pretty quickly.</p>
<h3>Re-organize my Trello</h3>
<p>I am a Trello geek. I think I have over ten boards on my Trello. When I want to break my productivity slump, I get on it and start re-organizing it. It helps me identify the tasks or clients that don&#8217;t need my attention urgently.</p>
<p>I can reschedule, reduce clutter, and start work with a clean state &#8211; all of which helps me become more productive and better at how I approach things.</p>
<h2>What do you think?</h2>
<p>As a new solopreneur, I am all about finding new ways to boost my productivity levels, work less and earn more. And, it would be great if you can help me perfect the way I am operating at the moment.</p>
<p>What do you have to say about my tips? Are they nifty enough for you?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you could make yourself happier, wouldn’t you? If you know the habits for happiness, would you consider doing them?</p>
<p>It’s natural to want to be happy, since ‘happiness’ is just your brain moderating the chemicals flowing around your body in a way that leaves you content and smiling. Who<br />
wouldn’t want that?</p>
<p>Well, it’s not really about who wants it, but rather who’s prepared to make the effort to get into good habits which will allow them to be happier every day. Surprisingly, many of these habits don’t actually require that much work. It&#8217;s putting them in place and sticking to them that can be difficult, particularly for those people who face serious life events or stressful situations have put them into a depressive state.</p>
<p>With that being said, here are some of the easiest habits for happiness you can use to turn your life around.</p>
<h3>Go Outside</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55017" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/happiness-habits.jpg" alt="happiness habits" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/happiness-habits.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/happiness-habits-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Spending a lot of time cooped up in a room, be it your bedroom or an office, can<br />
be detrimental to your mental health.</p>
<p>Taking a brief walk outside and experiencing the fresh air and sounds of nature can do you a world of good when you’re feeling down. Constantly having that escape as an option every day when life just gets too much to deal with can create a ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ feeling.</p>
<p>As you get used to such practice, your mind will recognize that going outside and spending time relaxing can help you become happier.</p>
<h3>Gratitude</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314418.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Sadness and depression</a> can make people appear extremely selfish since they are<br />
sometimes unable to see past their own minds to the world outside their heads. Taking some time every day to note down the things that you are thankful for &#8212; be it your parents, your God(s) or even the tree in your garden &#8212; on a notebook or your phone can remind you of all the reasons you already have to be happy. You can even do this exercise mentally.</p>
<p><span style="color: #111111; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 22px;">Sleep</span></p>
<p>Most people know that going without sleep makes you cranky. Many people also know that it can even ruin your physical health to the point of death if you don’t sleep for too long.</p>
<p>However, did you also know that sleep is essential for concentration, patience, being calm and not getting too emotional over relatively small events?</p>
<p>Keeping a regular sleep schedule &#8212; alarms and apps can usually help with this &#8212; can improve your mood on a day-to-day basis. Sleeping well can keep you functioning properly and healthily. This is one good reason why this list of habits for happiness emphasizes its importance.</p>

<h3>Less TV</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55016" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/habit-for-happiness.jpg" alt="habit for happiness" width="600" height="424" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/habit-for-happiness.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/habit-for-happiness-400x283.jpg 400w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/habit-for-happiness-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/habit-for-happiness-594x420.jpg 594w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/habit-for-happiness-100x70@2x.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The notion that TV isn’t great for our physical health isn’t a new one: lounging<br />
around in your pajamas watching reality TV shows is a big warning sign for health<br />
problems such as obesity, especially when coupled with a low level of exercise and<br />
high calorie intake.</p>
<p>However, did you realize that it can be terrible for your mental health as well?</p>
<p>Too much TV time promotes anxiety, since you may find yourself comparing the models and celebrities on TV with your own life and the people around you. It can lead you down a dangerous path of idolization and self-loathing.</p>
<p>Instead, make a habit out of switching off the TV and doing something else in the time that you would’ve been wasting on the sofa. Read a book or go for a walk. Dance to your favorite music or cook your favorite meal!</p>
<p>TV doesn’t have to dominate your life and it certainly doesn’t belong in a happiness-filled life &#8212; or at least not in excess.</p>
<h3>Journals</h3>
<p>Getting into the habit of writing down your inner thoughts and feelings every day can<br />
be very de-stressing. It can help lift a lot of your problems off your shoulders.</p>
<p>Journals, whether they are physical books that you use pens and pencils on or apps on your smartphone or laptop, can be amazing not only as places to ‘vent’ but also as records for how far you have come.</p>
<p>Once, you might’ve been drowning in depressing thoughts, but your entries may have become more positive over time. Reading through this change can be a positive experience.</p>
<p>Emptying your thoughts into your daily journal can also make you feel happier. It can improve your life by sorting out your inner feelings, helping to make sense of the sometimes chaotic world inside your head.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remote work comes with numerous benefits. Whether you are a freelancer, run your own business or work for a company with flexible work options, getting out of the office is refreshing and can be great for creativity. But it can also be dangerous—for your data, at least. Fortunately, there are some simple, concrete actions and remote working security tips you can take to protect yourself from hackers, identity thieves, and data loss.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the best ways you can protect yourself and your assets when working remotely.</p>
<h3>Secure Your Network and Protect Your Identity</h3>
<p>We all know smart online practices are important, but if you’re running your own business (say, as a freelancer), they become an even higher priority. You’re not just protecting your personal identity now, but your business’ as well. It’s crucial to follow smart security practices and remote working security tips to keep your accounts, finances, and clients safe.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure your home Wi-Fi network.</strong> If you work from home, make sure you’re using a password-protected network. Without a password, anyone in range can join the network and potentially see your traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55011" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/working-remotely-security-tips.jpg" alt="working remotely security tips" width="600" height="392" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/working-remotely-security-tips.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/working-remotely-security-tips-400x261.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Make sure that you’ve changed your router password, too. Most routers have a default password that’s printed right on the device. This makes it too easy for someone to get the password, log in, and change your Wi-Fi credentials. Instructions for changing your password vary by router model but can usually be found in the manual.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow basic identity protection rules.</strong> If you’re running your own business, you’ve likely got a ton of passwords for different software and services. None of those passwords should be the same and you shouldn’t use any password that can be tied back to you personally (like your pet’s name or child’s birthday). Be careful about opening links in emails that you aren’t expecting. And, if you’re on a PC, perform regular scans with antivirus software.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/protecting-your-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Protecting Your Network From Cyber Criminals</a></strong></p>
<h3>Prevent Data Loss</h3>
<p>Nothing can ruin your day (or week) quite like having hardware failure and losing vital information. Having secure and accessible backups prevents downtime, keeps mission-critical data safe, and ensures you can serve your customers reliably.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perform regular backups.</strong> Grab yourself an external hard drive and set up your computer up to create regular backups on it. Most drives come with software that can schedule these backups for you. If you’re on a Mac, Time Machine is excellent for this because it automatically keeps multiple recent versions of every document. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Windows PCs</a> also come with built-in backup utilities.</li>
<li><strong>Use cloud storage.</strong> Saving files in the cloud serves two purposes. First, it gives you another backup in case your computer or external hard drive fails—backup redundancy is important. Second, it allows you to access those files from any computer, allowing you to be more flexible in your work. You can even access your files from your phone in a pinch. Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox are popular cloud storage solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Keep an off-site backup.</strong> Lastly, don’t keep all your backups in one place. Having an off-site backup gives you added security in the event something happens to your hardware. Fires, storms, and theft can all result in the loss of local backups and they’re typically out of your control. Keeping an extra hard drive at another location keeps you covered in the event something catastrophic happens. There are also online solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keep Company Secrets Safe</h3>
<p>Trade secrets are a hot commodity and protecting them is critical to long-term business success. Following a few simple remote working security tips can go a long way in keeping your business’ sensitive data in the right hands.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a VPN.</strong> A VPN (virtual private network) is a special network that encrypts traffic and disguises its source, keeping your data private. Without a VPN, even if your network is secure, your ISP and possibly others can see your internet traffic. A VPN allows you to work safely from anywhere without worry, even on public Wi-Fi.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55010" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/remote-working-security-tip.jpg" alt="remote working security tip" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/remote-working-security-tip.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/remote-working-security-tip-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Install a privacy screen on your laptop.</strong> If you do a lot of working in public places like cafes or coffee shops, keeping your screen concealed from prying eyes is important. Privacy screens are like screen protectors for your laptop but with a twist. If you’re viewing from an angle, they obscure the screen’s contents so passersby can’t read your sensitive information. Some laptops (especially business models) come with this as a built-in option, meaning no extra filter required. You can even get them for phones and tablets.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypt your data.</strong> In the event that your computer or backup drives are stolen, encryption helps ensure that the thieves can’t access the critical information stored on them. Windows and Mac computers both come with tools to encrypt both the computer itself and any backup drives you connect to it. Remember to use a strong password!</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence is the stuff of nightmares and science fiction stories. What if it goes rogue and thinks we are dispensable? It’s not as far-fetched as you might think.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence can automate many of the repetitive things we do every day. It can even drive for us and recognize different human faces.</p>
<p>The problem?</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is only as unbiased as we can program it to be &#8212; and we are humans with bias. How can we ensure AI is programmed in an ethical and unbiased way?</p>
<h2>The Proven History of Bias In AI</h2>
<p>People have tried several times to program AI to take over lower-level tasks. It was supposed to free us up to handle the things that are higher-order in nature.</p>
<p>Amazon famously tried this with its hiring protocols. It fed resumes into an artificial intelligence algorithm, telling it which candidates were successful hires. The result was not only that the AI refused to consider women applicants for jobs, but it also kicked out any resumes that have women as references.</p>
<p>There are more dangerous instances of biased programming in artificial intelligence. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.11097.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">2019 study</a> found that driverless cars were better at detecting pedestrians with lighter skin tones. The data fed to the algorithm contained three times as many light-skinned people as it did dark-skinned people. So, the AI learned to detect lighter skinned people much faster but struggled to identify people with darker skin tones.</p>
<p>There’s also been a lot of talks lately about facial recognition software utilized by police departments. Some cities and states are banning the practice. However, states like Orlando, Florida and Washington County, Oregon have already started using the software.</p>
<p>It has many of the same problems as facial detection software in autonomous vehicles. The programming is biased and often misidentifies people with darker skin tones. The ACLU compared 25,000 mugshots with photos of members of congress and found 28 false matches, 39% of which were people of color. This technology scans police body camera footage as well as security footage even with known flaws.</p>
<h2>The Purpose Of Ethical AI</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence can potentially make our lives easier. If we can figure a way to program AI to be ethical, we can actually use the technology to save lives. Driverless cars are estimated to save us up to 250 million hours of free time, $234 billion in public costs in savings from accidents, and 90% of traffic fatalities. But this is, of course, only if it is programmed correctly.</p>
<figure id="attachment_54991" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-54991" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/driverless-car.jpg" alt="driverless car" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/driverless-car.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/driverless-car-250x150.jpg 250w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/driverless-car-400x240.jpg 400w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/driverless-car-250x150@2x.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Via phys.org</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s not even a consensus about how driverless cars should react in situations that could lead to death or injury. Only about three-quarters of people believe that driverless cars should save as many lives as possible. There’s not even a consensus that human life is more valuable than property or other considerations.</p>
<p>There are people who believe that autonomous vehicles should spare the lives of children almost unanimously. However, less preference is given to the lives of criminals or animals. What’s more, very few people were actually willing to spend the money to buy a car with programming that would minimize harm.</p>
<h2>How Can We Promote Ethical AI?</h2>
<p>As the old saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>If we want artificial intelligence to be less biased, we have to understand the inner workings of human bias. We need to spend the time to ensure it doesn’t get translated into the AI’s training modules.</p>
<p>Training the AI to weigh darker skin tones more heavily or to ignore gender could help make the algorithms less biased. Being more careful about the data that is fed into the system and monitoring for any problems in the output are going to be crucial steps moving forward. Subtle human bias can be multiplied when it becomes part of an algorithm. Once the AI is left to its own devices this can become a serious problem.</p>
<p>If we want to be able to fully benefit from AI, we need to do the work on the front end to make sure it thinks ethically.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have thought that bullying was left behind back in your school, but you’d be surprised to know that bullying can still occur in the workplace. As you get older, the effects of bullying can lead to<a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/bullying/conditioninfo/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"> many health concerns</a>, including physical and psychological effects. This can cause stress, lack of confidence, and low productivity at work.</p>
<p>Also, if you may have thought that bullying comes just from a position of power, you’d be mistaken. Bullying can come from any person within the organization &#8212; from the manager, right down to a colleague.</p>
<p>It’s important that you’re able to take the appropriate steps to protect yourself. Below are some tips you can use in dealing with bully at work.</p>
<h3>Review Your Actions</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54989" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dealing-with-bully.jpg" alt="dealing with bully" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dealing-with-bully.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dealing-with-bully-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Before you decide to make a drastic decision on dealing with bullying at work, you should double-check with yourself to see whether you may be contributing in some way to what’s going on. It’s likely that you’re simply doing nothing, but you have to see whether you can be the bigger person and realize that you may be making a mistake.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, the ‘bullying’ may have just been a one-off occurrence which means it would be better to simply let it go. Moving on can be a solution in itself.</p>
<h3>Try To Deal With The Matter Sooner Rather Than Later</h3>
<p>It can be understandable to not feel the need to speak up when you’re being bullied. This might just be because you’re simply scared or prefer not to disclose your issues with others. In other cases, the bully maybe someone of power which means there’s a lot more at stake than just pride.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to understand that long-term bullying can have a significant impact on your health and well-being. This is why it shouldn’t be something that should be lingered on. You should look to act promptly on the matter before it escalates to a point where you’re unable to handle the situation.</p>

<h3>Inform Those Above You</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54988" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dealing-with-work-bully.jpg" alt="dealing with work bully" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dealing-with-work-bully.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dealing-with-work-bully-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>In school, you might have not been forgiven being a ‘tell-tale’ to the teachers, but it can be a larger matter when it comes to bullying at work. There are far more important matters on the line such as your career, your general health, and your future. If you’re uncomfortable with dealing with the situation yourself, speak to those in HR or higher up who can support you in resolving the matter.</p>
<h3>Don’t Take The Bullying To Heart</h3>
<p>This can be difficult to do but if you take the bullying personally, it can heighten the effects it’s having on you already. It’s important to remember that when a bully is doing what they do, it’s more to do with their insecurities than the concerns that you have. If you can, develop healthy emotional boundaries to prevent you from reacting in a negative way to the bullying when it occurs. Bullies are more likely to thrive on your negative reaction and potentially do it more.</p>
<h3>Document All Instances</h3>
<p>This is probably the most important tip on dealing with bully at work. Ensure that you document all the instances where you’ve made contact with the bully and any confrontations that you’ve had. This allows you to provide timelines and recall any information you might forget. It can even support your case if you choose to take legal proceedings towards the bully. This can normally be valid when contacting a dispute resolution solicitor to help enforce a legal case on the colleague involved.</p>
<p>Workplace bullying is a matter that needs more awareness. Many choose to keep it under the radar and suffer in silence. However, supporting yourself and taking a stand can be beneficial not only in stopping bullying, but also helping others to take a stand for themselves, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, a lot of online gurus portray dropshipping as a cash cow, promising quick profits with minimum investment. If that&#8217;s true, then even a hundred dollars is good enough to get going. Unfortunately, not all that glitters is gold and not all dropshipping tips work. There are things that may or may not work for you.</p>
<p>Building and running a successful dropshipping business is possible. To avoid pitfalls, it is better to follow some successful strategies, like the ones we&#8217;ll be explaining below.</p>
<h3>Niche Selection</h3>
<p>A narrow niche, preferably a small niche with low competition, should be selected. In the past, dropshippers created single-product stores that they close after the trend of those products fade.</p>
<p>Nowadays, nobody can afford to lose all leads every time and start off again with every new product. Marketing campaigns and, especially Facebook campaigns, are getting more expensive every day. Therefore, the only way to make a real profit is to retain old customers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a broad niche or a general store requires a huge marketing budget and quite often eventually leads to failure.</p>
<h3>Advertising Methodology</h3>
<p>Facebook ads are the most common tool for dropshippers to promote their items. A normal strategy to start testing new products is the one that I&#8217;ll describe below.</p>
<p>Paid campaigns were set up for selling products at the test store.</p>
<p>The page title usually is the store’s brand name or a generic phrase that can give an idea of what kind of niche we are talking about.</p>
<p>Selecting ‘Snowboard Mania’ as the Facebook page’s title increased the audience’s likelihood of interacting with the page’s content.</p>
<p>Users who interacted with a combination of the product’s video and images ads were later retargeted for product sales through a carousel campaign or an Instant Experience ad.</p>
<h3>Product Research</h3>
<p>An experienced dropshipper performs preliminary research to find winning products: an item that can have high volume sales and low advertising spend ratio guarantees profits.</p>
<p>Product research involves running Facebook campaigns for different items to find the most profitable ones.</p>
<p>Normally, multiple tests are run before one finds a winning product. The Facebook Pixel connected to a page garnered millions of view and information about a niche. The pixel learns and, in time, finding the same niche customer became easier. With this in mind, it is useful for product discovery analyzing competitors within a niche.</p>
<h3>Product Procurement</h3>
<p>Until there is considerable sales volume, AliExpress retailers are a reliable source for product procurement. Newcomers usually start with manual order assignment moving to automated process at later stages with supplier apps like Yakkyofy. They can assure faster and more stable shipment time than AliExpress and consequently a low complaint ratio.</p>
<h3>Customers &#8211; Repeat orders or Chargebacks</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54980" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dropshipping-tip.jpg" alt="dropshipping tip" width="600" height="430" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dropshipping-tip.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dropshipping-tip-400x287.jpg 400w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dropshipping-tip-586x420.jpg 586w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The majority of dropshippers face quality issues as products come from remote suppliers and customer complaints claiming product not meeting descriptions are not uncommon. The high return shipping costs makes returning the product to the shipper unviable. Thanks to mail subsidies, Chinese suppliers manage to ship the product to the customer at a fraction of the return shipping cost.</p>
<p>The consequence of this complaint is that several customers end up registering a dispute or a chargeback with the payment processor or credit card issuer. Before, this wasn&#8217;t a boundary but only a nuisance but today, the<a href="https://chargeback.com/average-chargeback-rates-how-does-your-business-compare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"> industry-standard maximum charge-back rate</a> has become 1%. Over this, the account of the dropshipper can be frozen with all the money inside.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is important to limit complaints with good customer care. The product quality has also another repercussion: repeat orders are almost non-existent. They can result in a low lifetime customer value.</p>
<h3>Product Return Rate</h3>
<p>The standard eCommerce retail return rate is around 35%. It is surprisingly lower within a dropshipping model.</p>
<p>Dropshippers usually adopt a return policy which holds the buyer liable for the return shipping costs unless the item is defective upon arrival. The return shipping costs are high. At times, it&#8217;s more so than the purchase price rendering the process unfeasible.</p>
<p>Dropshippers based in the country where their primary customer base is located have an obvious advantage. They could accept returns domestically and maintain a buffer stock to expedite shipping.</p>
<h3>Optimization &#8211; Increasing Sales</h3>
<p>Understanding why your customer leaves your website without buying anything and correcting the problem is the key to success.</p>
<p>The global shopping cart abandonment rate is 67.9% and the commonly cited reasons include return policy-related issue, a slow website, and high shipping costs.</p>
<p>Increasing the checkout rate is desirable and optimization involves identifying the underlying causes and rectifying them. Visitor recording tool like Hotjar capture videos of user activity, which help understand the rationale behind cart abandonment.</p>
<p>Follow-up email sent to customers who leave their email address before dropping out results in recovering otherwise lost revenue.</p>
<h3>Scaling &#8211; Boosting Sales</h3>
<p>Scaling a best seller product is the main goal of every dropshipper. However, it is the most difficult challenge in this business for many reasons.</p>
<p>For one, it involves managing a stable and reliable order fulfillment process and also preparing your business structure to sustain the number of sale with a good customer care and a good website infrastructure.</p>
<p>Increasing the ad budget without a proper strategy can be counterproductive. It will make your ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) decrease. Targeting new interests to reach out to a different set of audience is one way to maintain ROAS. Data from Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel provide insights for better targeting.</p>
<p>Lookalike and Custom audiences are scaling tools which are usable once the desired volume is reached. A custom audience is simply the set of users who have performed a specific task. Lookalike audience tool is part of the Facebook ad panel. It creates an audience similar to the existing one.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54983" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dropshipping-success-tips.jpg" alt="dropshipping success tips" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dropshipping-success-tips.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dropshipping-success-tips-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Dropshippers are limited by short-term success unless the fundamental obstacles are taken care of. So, you have to choose a niche of product, build customer loyalty, and increase the quality of the products. Don&#8217;t forget about customer care services, too. These dropshipping tips will take your business a long way.</p>
<p>To achieve those things, you can use supplier apps, like Yakkyofy, that allow dropshippers to automate the fulfillment process. They are important in having stable shipping and quality check on the products.</p>
<p>This kind of app creates a hybrid model where you can automate the dropshipping process and preparing to scale by purchasing products stock.</p>
<p>This kind of sourcing app puts a dropshipper in contact with many different suppliers. Being the main interlocutor, they take responsibility for shipping delays, checking the quality, and shipping samples. All these tasks are more typical of a fulfillment center than of a dropshipping business.</p>
<p>This system also gives you the possibility to source for new products fast. In fact, item research is an ongoing process and what product may sell right now may not sell as well in the near future.</p>
<p>This makes one thing clear: dropshipping does work if proper strategies are followed and a planned implementation is carried out. That said, it isn’t as undemanding as many within the industry might want you to believe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Large corporations, governments, and even small businesses are always at a high risk of being attacked. Hackers and cybercriminals aim to steal your money no matter who or what you are.  Cyber-attacks have an <a href="https://www.information-age.com/cyber-attacks-malwarebytes-cybercrime-report-123481980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">increase of 235%</a>, according to a report issued by Malware Labs in 2019.</p>
<p>Malware, Man-In-The-Middle, and phishing are some of the most common types of cyber attacks, but which could be more destructive? The answer is ransomware.</p>
<p>Ransomware is on the rise in the cyber world. It is a type of malware attack that will steal your data. Criminals will demand ransom to return your data.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and Baltimore City faced ransomware attacks. These drove smaller businesses, thinking that large corporations and governments are the only targets of a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>The truth, however, is that every business should prepare itself to prevent this attack. Every business needs to know how to prevent ransomware.</p>
<h2>Difference between ransomware and other cyber attacks</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54841" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ransomware.jpg" alt="ransomware" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ransomware.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ransomware-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Ransomware doesn’t lack confidential information or personal data to be effective. This distinct behavior makes it different from other cyber attacks. It surfs for data in an organization that is valuable enough for the victim to pay the ransom just to get them back.</p>
<p>Ransomware is a very effective approach of hackers to paralyze an organization. It restricts their access to their information, deliver services, and accept payments. All these obstacles will turn customers of an organization away.</p>
<h2>How to Prevent Ransomware</h2>
<p>Ransomware can cost a lot to a business so it must prepare itself to combat not only ransomware but all kinds of cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Several best practices businesses should implement to protect themselves from cyber attacks include:</p>
<h3>Security Software</h3>
<p>Security software is crucial for an organization to detect and deter fraudulent activity. This software should be strong enough to verify activities and detect potential harm to the organization.</p>
<p>If your business is online, then your organization must use an identity verification service. It is an anti-fraud technology for online businesses that can verify your customer and even employees online. It is capable of detecting if someone is pretending to be someone.</p>
<h3>Firewall &amp; Intrusion Detection/Protection</h3>
<p>Installing a firewall is a crucial security measure and any business should not neglect it. It can deny and allow access to a company network or a part of the network. By restricting access with the help of a firewall, an organization can prevent scammers.</p>
<h3>Web &amp; Email Filtering</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54842" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cyber-attack.jpg" alt="cyber attack" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cyber-attack.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cyber-attack-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>All efforts of preventing ransomware from getting in the network become useless when an end-user inadvertently opens a malicious email and click a malicious link. For end-users, it is becoming increasingly complex to detect all malicious emails as phishing attempts are becoming more sophisticated.</p>
<p>By email safety awareness training and email filtering for employees, an organization can mitigate the risk. It&#8217;s one of the best ways on how to prevent ransomware.</p>
<h3>User Education</h3>
<p>Users/clients are the most valuable asset of a company. Their protection should be the priority of any organization. An organization should arrange regular awareness programs for users to educate them about malicious links and persons.</p>

<h2>Backup offers the best protection</h2>
<p>Taking backup on regular basis can secure you from ransomware. In case you become a victim of ransomware, you can use your previous backup to keep going. Usually, taking backup costs you little to nothing but restoring backup could take days or weeks. It will cost you in labor and downtime to restore and recover your systems to make them fully functional.</p>
<p>Various types of backup, disaster, and threat prevention strategies are circulating in the market and every solution is valuable according to its use. You can protect your business by implementing a solution that mitigates risks attached to your business.</p>
<p>Your IT team or technical department should understand and analyze business deeply to provide and implement the best solution for unique problems. An IT team must identify which type of backups are beneficial for specific organizations and how to restore them more efficiently in less time in case of any critical situation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this article is to detail the idea behind child <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/neurology/divisions/movement-disorders/npsycheval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">neuropsychological assessment</a>. It highlights the significance of acquiring neuropsychological interpretation when children are going through learning disorders. It intends to benefit parents and educators to determine the sort of assessment that will be appropriate for their kids.</p>
<p>Additionally, it aims to clarify the benefit of looking for a complete child neuropsychological assessment and spot what it can offer in understanding a child’s brain behavior.</p>
<p>Now, this article won&#8217;t characterize which professionals are appropriate to conduct these assessments. It doesn&#8217;t offer an opinion with regards to the setting where these assessments may occur.</p>
<p>Neuropsychological assessments is available in a school environment and private and hospital settings &#8212; just like the situation for other sorts of assessments. There are several sorts of experts who conduct evaluations of children with regards to learning difficulties. However, it&#8217;s best if trained psychologists can do the neuropsychological assessments.</p>
<h2>Opting the Appropriate Evaluation for A Child</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54857" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/neuropsychological-assessment-of-children.jpg" alt="neuropsychological assessment of children" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/neuropsychological-assessment-of-children.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/neuropsychological-assessment-of-children-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>In some cases, lack of certainty exists with the way neuropsychological assessment can increase awareness on a child’s learning issue. Regular observation of children&#8217;s performance can come from their participation in educational experiences.</p>
<p>In most cases, a school psychologist observes the performance of children relevant to learning issues. The assessments are useful when it comes to evaluating numerous skills and abilities. The results add to the academic record of the child.</p>
<p>But standard school-based assessments might be inadequate because of organizational limitations. They may not offer the extensive, thorough evaluation of the brain qualified neuropsychologists can offer.</p>
<p>In most cases, schools don&#8217;t usually give extensive neuropsychological assessments as an aspect of their child study team assessments. In this way, it is significant for the parent, educator or other adult looking for an assessment to recognize the sort of assessment needed and what it offers.</p>
<p>For instance, teachers may modify the way they present verbal or visual material to a child relying upon the child’s memory profile. It is likewise useful for teachers to identify how adaptable the child’s brain is.</p>
<p>Could the child shift or change rapidly, starting with one idea to another? Could the child memorize a task and afterward repeat it or simplify to another circumstance?</p>
<p>Getting information with regards to these and other brain-related aspects help teachers structure modifiable educational programs. The absence of this sort of information can affect a child’s growth and disappointment climbs up for teachers and parents.</p>
<p>To make use of time, effort, and related resources at the time a parent, educator or health care expert requires an assessment for learning troubles, it is vital to pick the right assessment tool. At the point third-party payors or health care insurance coverage is looked for, a clear investigative inquiry is important. There needs to be a suitable referral for assessment.</p>
<h2>Conducting A Child Neuropsychological Assessment</h2>
<p>The essential job of a child is learning. At the point a child does not succeed in that aspect, it may mean the existence of subtle brain dysfunction of a formative characteristic. Moreover, the presence of medical risk factor in a child, (for example, a seizure syndrome or traumatic brain damage) may go through learning issues (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9604.2007.00452.x" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">PB Jantz, GA Coulter &#8211; Support for learning, 2007 &#8211; Wiley Online Library</a>).</p>
<p>The vital point is to distinguish brain-related matters. Academic and social involvements can start in an auspicious manner and boost a child&#8217;s benefit from schooling. Timely and suitable involvement can lessen the probability that the child will go through constant failure, which consequently may drive towards extreme emotional or behavioral challenges. These sorts of interference may incorporate environmental adjustments, remediation, recovery or the introduction of compensatory approaches.</p>
<p>In children having learning issues, the regular school-based assessment is adequate in recognizing their learning issues. It can suggest proper intervention, too. On the contrary, there are children who may find regular educational techniques unsuccessful.</p>
<p>These children require additional comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation of cognitive capabilities. In some cases, children may have gone through a shocking insult to their brains. It may have influenced their neurological and behavioral functioning.</p>
<p>In these sorts of scenarios, a thorough neuropsychological assessment is medically important. Contrasted to a psychoeducational assessment, a neuropsychological assessment covers a wide range of issues associated with central nervous functions. It&#8217;s essential in analyzing and planning viable rehabilitation and associated interventions.</p>
<p>The neuropsychological assessment manages information with regards to the way the brain operates with recognizable performance. This makes it a practical, valuable, and gainful tool in educational and recuperation planning.</p>
<h2>Particular Needs in Case of Traumatic Brain Injury</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54856" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children-neuropsychological-assessment.jpg" alt="children neuropsychological assessment" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children-neuropsychological-assessment.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children-neuropsychological-assessment-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Authorized educational services have transformed the face of evaluation requirements in public schools through the previous decade because of the IDEA, 1990, IDEA, 2004.</p>
<p>In this case, public schools should give services associated with the educational requirements of children who have disabled school functioning because of TBI. The kind of information needed to manage instructional programming for children with TBI is more complicated as compared to what the standard school-based assessment offers.</p>
<p>A neuropsychological assessment is fundamental for understanding the child’s cognitive qualities and shortcomings.</p>
<p>With the help of neuropsychological assessment, it&#8217;ll be easy to identify the brain&#8217;s strengths. Good examples include the child’s memory for learning or the child’s psychomotor effectiveness for participation in classroom activities.</p>
<p>With the help of this assessment, proper individualized educational plans (IEPs) can be made, as legally necessary.</p>
<p>IEPs are assigned to children in public schools with medical disorders that hinder academic advancement. The eligibility criteria are set by the federal law. This includes children who have learning issue because of circumstances, like seizure issue, hydrocephalus or brain tumors.</p>
<p>Children having these sorts of issues require assessments of their cognitive behavior before proper instructional plans can be made. A thorough child neuropsychological assessment is a suitable procedure to acquire fundamental information regarding the child’s functioning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting a marketing campaign from scratch can feel overwhelming. In case you have never made a marketing campaign or if you have at least tried and just felt like you were in a tight spot, you&#8217;d know how tough it is.</p>
<p>However, if you want serious returns for your new business, you need to think your marketing campaigns through.</p>
<p>Preferably, before you plan a coupon marketing campaign, you ought to have a marketing plan for your business. The marketing plan is the foundation of your marketing strategy for a product or service. It gives the general coupon marketing strategies and objectives to draw your target market to the products or service your business offers.</p>
<p>A good marketing campaign includes only a bit of your actual marketing plan—an activity intended to accomplish a specific marketing goal. When you know how your campaign fits into your general marketing plan, then you can distinguish your objective market and how best to approach them.</p>
<p>Here are some things you should consider before starting a marketing campaign for your product/service.</p>
<h3>When to start your campaign</h3>
<p>Your marketing campaign must have a start and an end date. Utilize a calendar to schedule and plot out the significant dates and activities.</p>
<p>Figuring out when to begin your promotions is similar to tossing spaghetti at a wall. You study different marketing strategies and implement what you think fits the bill.</p>
<p>Hence, there is no definite answer to this question as it varies from business to business. You need to consider your market, the type of product or service, the purpose of the product, and other factors before you can decide when to start your marketing campaign. However, you need to take your time to plan out and design the campaign and the strategies you will need to implement in order to make the campaign successful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/marketing-questions-to-ask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ask Questions Before Approving a Marketing Campaign Plan</a></strong></p>
<h3>Pick your target audience</h3>
<p>Before you start your coupon marketing campaign, you have to decide the “who”. You need to determine your target market and how you will contact them.</p>
<p>The most ideal approach is to comprehend their novel difficulties and how you can tackle them. Characterize purchaser personas for your customers so you can refine your messages to their particular needs as they assess their alternatives.</p>
<h3>Create a content calendar</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54836" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/target-marketing-campaign.jpg" alt="target marketing campaign" width="600" height="390" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/target-marketing-campaign.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/target-marketing-campaign-400x260.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When you share content on different marketing platforms, it tends to be hard to remain on track. On the off chance that you fall behind, completely disregard a platform or miss a post, it could destroy your whole campaign.</p>
<p>Endeavor to recall what content to post and when can be a noteworthy pressure. Occasional posts and conflicting messages may make your clients think that you don&#8217;t care about your online nearness.</p>
<p>A content schedule or calendar will enable you to remain on track and guarantee you&#8217;re posting the right data at the best time. Rather than expecting to recollect what day you should post something, you can check your calendar every morning to decide what ought to be planned for that day.</p>
<p>Moreover, it enables you to see the master plan for your marketing procedure. You will know how each bit of your marketing content fits together to make the whole campaign.</p>

<h3>Where to distribute your campaign</h3>
<p>What media channel will you use to convey your message and pull in and catch your customers?</p>
<p>Some marketing platforms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Search Engines</li>
</ul>
<p>The channels you pick should depend on your business, target audience, and objectives.</p>
<p>Note: The channel is the way to communicate with people. The strategy is how you use the channel to promote your business. So, your coupon marketing strategy is the thing that you post, share on the marketing channel to promote engagement which turns into leads.</p>
<h3>Set your marketing campaign budget</h3>
<p>The amount of cash you can spend on your campaign will enormously influence the advertising strategies you pick.</p>
<p>A billboard is much more expensive than flyers. Try not to rely upon free publicizing and advancement procedures for your business.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that all free advertising techniques are terrible. However, there is always an expense to marketing. The best method to achieve your target market may not be so cheap, so be reasonable when setting your campaign budget.</p>
<h3>Track and measure results</h3>
<p>It is imperative to monitor your marketing strategies to results. Results will be dictated by what your objectives were for the campaign. Following and estimating results can be easy or complex depending on the business.</p>
<p>When you have finished your campaign, keeps these things in mind during the review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did your offer fulfill the needs of your target customers? If not, what would you be able to offer that will?</li>
<li>What did you discover that you can apply to your next campaign?</li>
<li>Did you meet the objectives? If not, why?</li>
<li>Should anything change next time you run the campaign?</li>
</ul>
<p>Boosting a marketing campaign isn&#8217;t something you can do rapidly and accomplish results overnight. Every activity should be arranged and carefully thought of before you start the campaign. Without an appropriate plan, your campaign is probably going to fall flat.</p>
<h3>Make changes</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54837" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/marketing-campaign.jpg" alt="marketing campaign" width="600" height="398" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/marketing-campaign.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/marketing-campaign-400x265.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>You can dissect, measure, and track your marketing practices to figure out what your crowd will associate with. When you realize your coupon marketing campaign isn&#8217;t verging on accomplishing your objectives, then you need to make changes.</p>
<p>Remain mindful of how your audience is responding, yet keep your team ready to make improvements and amendments wherever necessary. Do not sit idle or waste your money on a campaign that will not bring you any returns.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The key takeaways here are to focus on the needs of your audience, pick the channels that you believe will give the best return, and monitor your progress and finally stick with what works for your business. Consider the factors mentioned above before starting a marketing campaign to get the most out of your coupon marketing efforts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wondering how to get the most out of your workout?</p>
<p>Time isn&#8217;t really the key.</p>
<p>Spending two hours or more at the gym is a really long time, unless fitness is your job or you’re training for something. Yet, so many people feel that if they don’t spend hours at the gym working out, the trip is wasted.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time to start getting more efficient with your workout routine if you are a 2-hour gym-goer. Spending that much time at the gym isn’t really sustainable. So, if you want to make fitness a lifelong practice, here are some tips on how to get the most out of your workout in the gym.</p>
<h3>Cut The Fat Out of Your Routine</h3>
<p>Let’s face it &#8212; almost everyone who spends two hours at the gym isn’t working out the entire time. Instead, they are fiddling on their phones looking for their pump-up songs, scrolling through social media, taking phone calls or just considering what exercise to do next.</p>
<p>If you recognize yourself in any of these time-wasting situations, it’s time for you to cut the fat out of your gym routine. Some of the things you can do to resist fiddling with your phone and focus on your workout are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create one or more playlists that are full of music that you can easily workout to without touching your phone to find the next song you want.</li>
<li>Make plans before you go to the gym on what you are going to do, whether it’s arm day, core or something else. Along with having a clear idea of your exercise focus, you may want to plan exactly what exercises you want to tackle.</li>
<li>Put your phone on silent so that you resist the urge to answer texts, calls or scroll through social media.</li>
<li>Go tech-free with your workouts and just focus on what you are doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without all the fiddling and distraction, you may find that you can cut out at least 30 minutes out of your workout time at the gym.</p>
<h3>Add High-Intensity Workout Days</h3>
<p>If you have mainly focused on endurance workouts when you are at the gym, then it may be time to add some high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to your routine.</p>
<p>Often, HIIT workouts are around 25 to 30 minutes long. It can get you in and out of the gym a lot faster than usual. Even better, you can actually <a href="https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/HIITfastloss.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">improve your fat loss speed</a> and develop muscle faster than a long, dragging workout.</p>
<p>In fact, researchers looked into the efficacy of HIIT workouts and made a clear point that HIIT exercises are excellent in reducing body fat levels. Also, the explosive movements of the interval training allow you to continue with your muscle-building without needing hours of exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/how-to-start-interval-training-right-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">How To Start Interval Training The Right Way</a></strong></p>
<h3>Lift Heavier Weights To Failure</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54829" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/heavy-weights-workout.jpg" alt="heavy weights workout" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/heavy-weights-workout.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/heavy-weights-workout-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Many people focus on endurance lifting where they do 2-3 sets of 10 repetitions of a weight lifting exercise. While there isn’t anything inherently wrong with endurance lifting, it does take a good deal of time to do it correctly.</p>
<p>Instead, you can opt to lift heavier weights until you fail. You don’t need to do heavier lifts for every workout if you enjoy endurance lifting. You can just replace one or two of your regular lifting days with heavier weights, which you can lift until you cannot anymore.</p>
<h3>Focus On Compound Exercises</h3>
<p>Instead of doing exercises that focus on a single movement, you can do compound exercises to reduce the time you spend at the gym. For example, instead of doing just bicep curls, you can make it a compound exercise by combining bicep curl and transitioning to the military press, then back to bicep curl. If you also do all these while standing, you can help improve your stability.</p>
<p>Also, if you are concerned that combining exercises will reduce the effectiveness, don’t worry about that. There have been studies that show that whether you do single-joint exercises or multi-joint exercises, you will still enjoy the same benefits.</p>
<h3>Take Your Exercise Outdoors</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54831" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/outdoor-workout.jpg" alt="outdoor workout" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/outdoor-workout.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/outdoor-workout-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Working out outside takes some inventiveness, but once you get the hang of it, you can see the endless possibilities. For instance, take your average park with a jungle gym, winding track, grassy field, and swings.</p>
<p>You can build a unique workout &#8212; one that starts with bodyweight fitness using various bars and platforms there. Follow that up with a HIIT workout and end your workout with a bang.</p>
<p>As bodyweight exercises cause you to use more muscles than just lifting weights alone, you can dedicate half the time you normally would in the gym to your outdoor workouts.</p>
<p>By making these changes to your gym workout routine, you can cut down on the time you spend at the gym without making a negative impact on your fitness gains.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a foodie and looking to expand your culinary horizons, have you considered what the US has to offer? The States is absolutely jam-packed with diverse cultural food options. The best foodie cities in America won&#8217;t disappoint you.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re seeking hometown dishes, a gourmet experience or something with a foreign-twist, the US is often described as a &#8216;foodie&#8217;s haven&#8217;. It will definitely be a great destination for you.</p>
<p>As such, here is a list of the five top US cities that foodies should visit!</p>
<h3>New Orleans</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54826" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/new-orleans-best-foodie-cities-in-america.jpg" alt="new orleans best foodie cities in america" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/new-orleans-best-foodie-cities-in-america.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/new-orleans-best-foodie-cities-in-america-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>At the top of our list of the best foodie cities in America is New Orleans. It&#8217;s well-known for its Cajun and Creole dishes. Some of them have a direct influence from Spanish, Italian or African cooking techniques.</p>
<p>One of the most popular dishes that you will find scattered throughout the city is Gumbo. If you&#8217;ve never tried it, then you&#8217;re missing out.</p>
<p>Gumbo is a stock-based broth that contains a choice of meat or seafood. It&#8217;s packed with peppers, celery, and onions.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for something sweet to compliment your main course, New Orleans is also famous for its Beignets. These beauties are squared pieces of fried dough with a huge coating of sugar.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after a fine dining experience, the likes of Leah Chase and Susan Spicer both have highly rated restaurants in the city.</p>
<h3>San Francisco</h3>
<p>While San Francisco is best known for its tech-savvy population, this appetite for innovation also extends to its food industry. For those of you that have a taste for the good living, <a href="//sf.eater.com/maps/san-francisco-bay-area-michelin-restaurants-stars-2019”" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">San Francisco is home to heaps of Michelin-starred restaurants</a>. This includes Quince, the French Laundry, and Atelier Crenn.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a more casual eating scene, the city has a range of international-themed locations.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after Mexican food, head over to the Mission. Italian? North Beach is your best bet. The city even has its very own Chinatown for those after an Asian-inspired serving.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you choose to dine, San Francisco has an excellent reputation for sourcing ingredients locally. As such, why not head over to one of the 50+ farmer&#8217;s markets scattered around the Bay Area to experience local produce in its purest form?</p>
<h3>Berkeley</h3>
<p>With the Californian city of Berkeley topping a recent list as the <a href="//oxfordsummercourses.com/articles/most-cultural-student-cities/”" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"> Most Cultural Student City </a>in the world, it will come as no surprise to learn that its foodie scene is just as diverse. The city has everything &#8212; from popular street food vendors selling traditional Indian delights, to award-winning Brunch eateries serving up dishes from the South of France.</p>
<p>If you instead fancy grabbing yourself a Burrito, then you&#8217;ll want to head over to Cancun restaurant. If tacos are more your thing, then Picante in West Berkeley produces its corn in-house.</p>
<p>Bekerely is also great if you like the sound of washing your evening meal down with some locally produced craft beer. The city is home to a plethora of home-brewers, some of which can be enjoyed while watching a local band.</p>
<h3>New York</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54825" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-foodie-cities-in-america-new-york.jpg" alt="best foodie cities in america new york" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-foodie-cities-in-america-new-york.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/best-foodie-cities-in-america-new-york-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Ah, New York, New York.</p>
<p>The city is so great that they decided to name it twice! The Big Apple is potentially one of the most diverse cities in the US, especially with respect to its internationally acclaimed food scene. No matter what type of dish you&#8217;re after, New York has something to suit all budgets.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a rush and want to grab a quick bite, the streets of New York are packed with hotdog vendors and Pizza parlous. The city is also <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/g23133120/new-york-city-best-bagels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">famous for its bagels</a>, so we&#8217;d suggest heading over to Tompkins Square if you&#8217;re looking for the real deal.</p>
<p>Outside of its more casual scene, New York also has a range of options for the fine diner. Celebrity chefs such as Alex Guarnaschelli and Marc Forgione have highly rated restaurants in the city, so be prepared to splurge!</p>
<h3>Los Angeles</h3>
<p>Last but certainly not the least in this list of the best foodie cities in America is Los Angeles. While the city is home to some of the most expensive properties in the world, don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking that the foodie scene follows suit.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Los Angeles is well known for its <a href="//la.eater.com/maps/best-cheap-eats-restaurants-los-angeles”" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">top-rated, highly affordable street food eateries</a>. Whether you&#8217;re into Mexican, sushi, Lebanese or vegan-inspired dishes, Los Angeles is the place to be.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also find heaps of boutique-esque food trucks scattered around the city. Some of them serve the best tacos and bagels that Los Angeles has to offer!</p>

The figure showed that around 13 million of disposable and non-disposable plastics are ending up in the world oceans each year. This triggered a complete ocean cleanup project.</p>
<p>Though ocean cleanup is a relatively new term, some organizations are toiling hard to develop <a href="https://pressurewasherify.com/blog/ocean-cleanup-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">effective ocean cleanup machines</a> and technologies.

<p>I told earlier that ocean cleanup is relatively a recent term taken to concern. So, it is no surprise that there are only a few significant technologies and machines invented for the purpose. UNEP, last year, defined five ICT based technologies significant for ocean cleanup tasks.</p>
<h3>Social Sites</h3>
<figure id="attachment_54820" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-54820" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beat-plastic-pollution.jpg" alt="beat plastic pollution" width="600" height="306" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beat-plastic-pollution.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beat-plastic-pollution-400x204.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Via mygardenstory.plantsguru.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>UNEP declared that creating awareness through social sites among general people on the critical issue of ocean cleanup is a well-planned solution. Today, nearly about 2 billion people use the internet daily.</p>
<p>So, reaching them through the internet to create awareness about plastic pollution and ocean cleanup is easy. A campaign #BeatPlasticPollution has already on effect for such reasons.</p>
<h3>Satellite Images</h3>
<p>The oceans are unimaginably huge. It’s quite impossible to scan each inch of them to apply the cleanup project. Thus, the use of satellites to capture raw images of plastic consumption across the oceans goes a long way in looking for targeting areas. The European Space Agency (ESA) and a non-profit organization named The Ocean Cleanup is working on the issue.</p>
<h3>Using Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>Popularly known as AI, artificial intelligence has gone through enormous development in recent times. Lately, the World Economic Forum suggested to harnessing artificial intelligence for ocean cleanup. The earth conservation is a key technology that includes big data analysis machine learning. They further discussed the possibilities of AI ahead.</p>
<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<p>As the use of AI and machine learning is opening up, the areas of Big data and data visualization are increasing rapidly to use for ocean cleanup. In the future, these will be the key to collect information to track and measure ocean plastic consumption.</p>
<p>However, one great drawback of this technology is that only 41 countries keep a record of their sea wastes.</p>
<h3>Recycling</h3>
<figure id="attachment_54819" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-54819" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-plastic-bank.jpg" alt="the plastic bank" width="600" height="337" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-plastic-bank.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-plastic-bank-400x225.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Via plasticbank.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nowadays, there’s a popular saying if you can’t recycle, refuse it. The Plastic Bank, another non-profit organization, is upholding the motto to its fullest. They are awarding people with blockchain secured tokens in lieu of recycled plastics. They aim to reduce the flow of plastics into the oceans by recycling them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/e-waste-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">E-Waste Tips: What To Do With Old Tech Gadgets</a></strong></p>
<p>Apart from these technologies, there are few machines developed and particularly designed to clean the wastes from the oceans.</p>
<h3>The Ocean Cleanup</h3>
<p>The Ocean Cleanup founded by Boyan Slat in 2013 is the pioneer in the sector. It is a non-government engineering organization which is working day and night to clean up the oceans.</p>
<p>The organization has already published several scientific types of research upon its findings on the oceans. They highlighted that trash usually accumulate near the five patches of the oceans. Among them, The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest.</p>
<p>Boyal Slat, the chief of the organization, proposed a prototype machine to clean the garbage from the oceans in early 2013. His design consisted of long, floating barriers fixed to the seabed. This would be attached to a central platform shaped like a manta ray for better stability.</p>
<p>However, the initiative has gone through several changes. Some significant changes took place in 2017. During the year, the working area went from 100 km to 1-2 km radius. Sea anchors were replaced in place of seabed anchors. Lastly, instead of gathering plastic,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>direct focus was given on concentrating the plastics to be carried away by the support vessels.</p>
<p>With the advent of 2018, The Ocean Cleanup took their prototypes into the real working environment. Last September 9, 2018, Maersk Launcher deployed codename Wilson about 204 nautical miles from the San Francisco coast. There, it underwent several trials and provided satisfactory results for the organization.</p>
<p>Then, The Ocean Cleanup sent Wilson to perform its first real-world duty to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It started with a very high note. However, the system faced several problems quickly.</p>
<p>It started losing the collected garbage due to the slow movement of the traveling barrier. To add to this, last December, due to severe mechanical stress, an 18-meter section was detached. The machinery and system were sent back to Hawaii to be repaired. It collected nearly 2000 kilograms of plastic during its operational period.</p>
<p>In 2019, The Ocean Cleanup declared to start their biggest project by summer by deploying Wilson again after repair. The organization is already raising fund for the execution of their future plans. Despite having doubts on the success of the machine and system buildup by the organizations, scientists and other organizations like UNEP have praised its idea.</p>
<p>Oceans are our best natural resources. However, our impatient and obnoxious craving for plastic materials have brought the deterioration of the sea environment. These resulted in a series of researches and inventions to clean up the piles of plastics in the oceans.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Thus, ideas of organizations like The Ocean Cleanup and The Plastic Bank are opening up new opportunities for us. Nevertheless, we, the people of Planet Earth, can’t deny our duty towards ensuring a cleaner ocean for our future generations.</p>
<p>We need to start reducing the use of plastics and recycle them whenever possible. After all, it is all about saving our mother Earth!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever freeze up when you get a text that goes, <em>“Hey, I&#8217;m depressed.”</em>?</p>
<p>I remember a while back when a friend sent me a text to tell me that she was depressed. It was the first time that I&#8217;d ever gotten a message like that and I was scared.</p>
<p>I was scared because I had no idea what to say or what not to say. I didn&#8217;t know how to talk to a depressed friend.</p>
<p>So, you know what I did?</p>
<p>I ignored that message and pretended that I didn&#8217;t see it for a while. By the time I was finally able to gather my thoughts to reply, my friend said something to me and those words haunted me for a while.</p>
<p><em>“I wanted to kill myself today and that was why I reached out to you. But I guess it&#8217;s safe to say that you don&#8217;t care, nobody does.”</em></p>
<p>I felt my heart shatter after I read that message. It was at that point that I decided that I was going to understand everything there was to know about depression.</p>
<p>You need to understand that you might be the reason why your depressed friend lives or dies. You&#8217;re the middle line between that tiny spark of hope and total unbreakable numbness.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s not easy talking to someone who is suffering from depression, especially when you&#8217;re totally clueless about the whole thing. And the crazy thing about being clueless is that you can actually make it a whole lot worse.</p>
<p>You might end up saying the wrong words and those wrong words might worsen your friend&#8217;s depression. It might ultimately trigger his or her suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being hard or extreme here, but I want you to understand just how important your words are when you&#8217;re talking to a depressed person.</p>
<p>So, how do you handle conversations with your depressed friend?</p>
<p>Before we go further, let&#8217;s answer one question first.</p>
<h2>What exactly is depression?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Depression</a> (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think, and how you act. It causes feelings of sadness and/or loss of interests in things that would normally interest you.</p>
<p>Depression has a lot of symptoms and they may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in appetite &#8211; which can appear as weight loss or weight gain</li>
<li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
<li>Feeling sad</li>
<li>Loss of interest in activities that once gave pleasure</li>
<li>Having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
<li>Having difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do you know if you&#8217;re sad or depressed?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54816" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sadness-and-depression.jpg" alt="sadness and depression" width="600" height="397" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sadness-and-depression.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sadness-and-depression-400x265.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>People are quick to throw the word “depressed’ around a lot these days.</p>
<p>The lines between sadness and depression have become blurred and most people seem to not know the difference anymore.</p>
<h2>What is sadness?</h2>
<p>Sadness is a normal human emotion.  It is usually triggered by a difficult and hurtful situation.</p>
<p>We all feel sad at some point in our lives.</p>
<p>Basically, we feel sad when something happens. When a loved one dies, you feel sad. When your favorite football team loses with a 6-0 margin, you feel sad.</p>
<p>These feelings are totally normal and we all go through it.</p>
<p>And when that something causing our sadness changes or when we have finally adjusted to it, our sadness goes away.</p>
<p>But depression is totally different.</p>
<p>When we are depressed, we feel sad about everything.</p>
<p>Depression is an abnormal emotional state. It&#8217;s a mental illness that affects how we think and do things.</p>
<p>Unlike sadness, depression does not necessarily require a difficult or challenging situation or a change in circumstance as a trigger. It just occurs.</p>
<p>It saps our energy, motivation, and our ability to experience joy, pleasure, excitement, anticipation, and satisfaction. Also, depression tends to last a whole lot longer.</p>
<p>So, how do you handle conversations with your depressed friend?</p>
<p>Now that we know the difference between sadness and depression, it is time we learn how to have that conversation.</p>
<p>Saying the right word is important but knowing the wrong words to avoid is more important.</p>
<p>The truth is that you can do a whole lot of damage with the wrong words.</p>
<p>So, these are the worst things to say to a friend who is depressed.</p>
<h3>1. Snap out of it</h3>
<p>Your friend can&#8217;t just snap out of depression. If they could just snap out of it, don&#8217;t you think they would have?</p>
<p>You need to understand that they did not choose to be depressed. It&#8217;s an illness, a chemical imbalance.</p>
<p>Whenever you&#8217;re having a conversation with your depressed friend, resist the urge to tell them to snap out of their own little world because snapping out is not within their power.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: If your friend was suffering from diabetes, would you tell them to snap out of it?</p>
<h3>2. Cheer up</h3>
<p>This might actually come from a good place in your heart like, <em>“Just cheer up mate and it&#8217;ll be alright.”</em></p>
<p>If all a depressed person needed to do was to cheer up and smile, then depression wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. But it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>There are people with depression who put on a fake smile that is so perfect that they could fool the entire world with it.</p>
<p>Depression isn&#8217;t cured by smiling, so refrain from telling your depressed friend to cheer up. Because it doesn&#8217;t help.</p>
<h3>3. It can&#8217;t be that bad</h3>
<p>Yes, it can!</p>
<p>It might not seem to be like a big deal to you. Instead, it might seem like a trivial matter or like your friend is exaggerating the whole situation. So, you conclude that it can&#8217;t be that bad.</p>
<p>But events that seem trivial to you are a big deal to your depressed friend. Why?</p>
<p>Because they do not have the internal resources to deal with the problem. Everything already seems less exciting and less worthwhile to them. Depression already saps their energy, motivation, satisfaction and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t possess your mental fortitude to deal with things. So, don&#8217;t trivialize their suffering.</p>
<h3>4. Pray for the spirit of depression to go away</h3>
<p>Yes, people actually do say this.</p>
<p>I was on Twitter when I came across a tweet of a suicidal victim. The victim said he was tired of being numb to things and he just wanted to end things.</p>
<p>After tagging a mental health support group in the tweet and making sure that they were aware of the suicidal tendencies of the victim, I decided to scroll through the replies to the tweets. What I saw shocked me and for a while, I couldn&#8217;t keep my mouth closed.</p>
<p>This is real!</p>
<p>People in the comment section were telling this guy that it was the devil&#8217;s work and he should just pray for the spirit of depression to get out.</p>
<p>I almost choked on my drink that day, because it wasn&#8217;t just one person that was actually saying such thing.</p>
<p>Depression isn&#8217;t a spirit and it&#8217;s not caused by a demon of any sorts. It is a chemical imbalance in the brain, an illness that can be treated.</p>
<p>So, please, never say this to your depressed friend. Tell them to see a professional.</p>
<h3>5. It&#8217;s all in your head</h3>
<p>It is true that depression is caused by a deficiency in the neurotransmitters in the brain, but this doesn&#8217;t nullify the fact that depression is real.</p>
<p>Depression is a real illness.</p>
<p>Anytime, you&#8217;re about to say something like “it&#8217;s all in your head”, think of your friend as a cancer patient with the tubes and beeping machines.</p>
<p>Maybe that will help remind you that depression is an illness that can actually kill.</p>
<h3>6. Who cares?</h3>
<p>I want to believe that no one actually says this to their friends, but I&#8217;ve come to understand that circumstances or situations influence the things we say.</p>
<p>I also understand that a depressed friend might seem self-centered. They appear to have built a mini world around them where they are all that&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>This might cause you to get angry and utter words like <em>“who cares”</em>.</p>
<p>But you have to remember that your depressed friend already feels like they have no worth as a human being and you uttering a statement like that just confirms it all.</p>
<h3>7. Stop feeling sorry for yourself</h3>
<p>You have to understand that people with depression are not choosing to feel sorry for themselves. In fact, they have no control over how they feel.</p>
<p>So, telling them <em>“to stop feeling sorry for themselves”</em> actually does a lot of damage. Why?</p>
<p>Because they simply can&#8217;t stop.</p>
<h3>8. It&#8217;s your own fault</h3>
<p>Even though the causes of depression are not entirely understood, one major thing that we all know is that no one chooses to voluntarily have this mental illness.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never anyone&#8217;s fault. It is a mental illness caused by environmental factors and chemical imbalances.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not their fault that they are depressed. They didn&#8217;t choose depression and they never did.</p>
<h3>9. Saying you understand (when you clearly don&#8217;t)</h3>
<p>Imagine if you lost an arm and you were telling someone with two arms how totally frustrating it is without your other arm and he says, <em>“I understand how it feels”</em>.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you feel like the person was just playing around? Like they were just taking your problems and frustrations as a joke?</p>
<p>The same thing goes for a person who is depressed. Don&#8217;t ever tell your depressed friend that you understand what they are going through when you don&#8217;t. It feels like you&#8217;re minimizing their experience.</p>
<p>Instead, tell them, <em>“I&#8217;m not going to pretend like I know exactly what you&#8217;re going through or how you truly feel, but tell me, what can I do to help?”</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d say anyway.</p>
<h3>10. It could be worse</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s actually true that things could get a whole lot worse. It could go from back to worse within a snap of a finger.</p>
<p>But you know what? That doesn&#8217;t really matter. You shouldn&#8217;t care about how worse things can get, all you should care about is how bad it is for your depressed friend.</p>
<p>They have it bad and it doesn&#8217;t matter that it can be worse, bad is bad. Don&#8217;t try to cheer them up by telling them that it can be worse.</p>
<h3>11. You never think of anybody but yourself</h3>
<p>Depression makes everything less interesting, less important, and less worthwhile for those suffering from it.</p>
<p>It saps their energy and quite a lot more. This might make them act like all they care about is themselves. Sometimes they might seem so selfish that it seems like they are all they think about.</p>
<p>But you have to understand that this isn&#8217;t their fault. They do not choose how they feel or act.</p>
<h3>12. But you don&#8217;t look depressed</h3>
<p>There are tons of depressed people who do not look depressed. They put on a perfectly fake smile that convinces a lot of people.</p>
<p>They carry out their daily activities without revealing any sign of their depression.</p>
<p>Not everyone who is depressed looks like they&#8217;re depressed. Sometimes, they cover their pain and sadness with a big smile.</p>
<p>Just because they don&#8217;t look depressed does not mean that their whole life is not falling apart.</p>
<h3>13. You just need to try harder</h3>
<p>Just because you can not see the illness does not mean that your friend is not trying hard enough.</p>
<p>Every day is basically a struggle. It can be demeaning when you tell someone who&#8217;s been struggling every day to try harder.</p>
<p>Understand that they are trying their best and they need you not to tell them to try harder.</p>
<h3>14. You should get out more</h3>
<p>Depression causes fatigue and lack of motivation. That is probably why your friend stays in every time.</p>
<p>Telling your friend to get out more doesn&#8217;t help in any way.</p>
<h3>15. This too shall pass</h3>
<p>This may be true. But, it doesn&#8217;t offer any real sense of hope to your depressed friend.</p>
<p>Instead, it leads to internal questions like, <em>&#8220;when will it end?&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Will it be days, months or years?</p>
<p>You have to understand that telling your depressed friend <em>“this too shall pass”</em> doesn&#8217;t actually make them better. You should avoid saying it because it really doesn&#8217;t help them.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re talking to your depressed friend, try not to sound judgmental. If you can do that, then you&#8217;ll be just fine.</p>
<p>So, what should you say to your depressed friend?</p>
<p>I got another text message from a friend, it went all, <em>“Hey, I&#8217;ve been thinking of killing myself for a while now.”</em></p>
<p>The moment I got the text message, I took a deep breath and engaged my friend in a conversation.</p>
<p>This time, I didn&#8217;t freeze up because I knew the right words to say and the wrong words to avoid.</p>
<p>Before you engage in a conversation with your depressed friend, try to keep yourself calm. Make sure that you&#8217;re not on edge as that would make the whole conversation sound kind of weird.</p>

<h2>How to Talk to A Depressed Friend</h2>
<p>So, what should you say?</p>
<h3>1. Tell them you care</h3>
<p>Letting your friend know just how much you care is important. It makes the person feel safe and it signifies that you&#8217;re someone he can confide in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple statement that carries a lot of weight and power.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to reach out and let your friend know that somebody cares about them.</p>
<h3>2. Let them know that you&#8217;re here for them</h3>
<p>Depression makes it feel like you&#8217;re alone and no one is there for you.</p>
<p>So, when you reach out to your depressed friend, let him know that you&#8217;ll be with him every step of the way. Assure them that he will not be alone.</p>
<p>This goes a long way in telling them that there&#8217;s always someone that they can fall back on.</p>
<p>It might not show at all but just know that you telling them that you&#8217;re here for them will mean the world to them.</p>
<h3>3. Ask your friend if there&#8217;s anything you can do to help</h3>
<p>Depression saps a person&#8217;s energy, so there are probably a ton of things that they&#8217;ll need help for.</p>
<p>However, they might be reluctant to accept your help at first. Don&#8217;t rush them but assure them that if there&#8217;s anything they need you for, you&#8217;ll be there to help.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they have zero ideas on what kind of help they need, so be prepared with a few specific questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could I come over later to help out with laundry?</li>
<li>Could I come over with your favorite meal?</li>
<li>Do you need help with grocery shopping?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a ton of things that you can offer to help with and trust me, it would mean a lot to your friend.</p>
<p>So, always ask if there&#8217;s anything you can do to help.</p>
<p>Sometimes, all they want is someone who will listen while they talk, so be prepared.</p>
<h3>4. Have you told a professional how you&#8217;re feeling?</h3>
<p>You need to ask them if they have told a professional how they are feeling. Remember that depression is an illness and it doesn&#8217;t just go away. Medical care is needed.</p>
<p>You have to understand that sometimes your depressed friend might feel ashamed and might not want to see a professional. It is your job to encourage them every step of the way.</p>
<p>Follow them to the appointment if you have to.</p>
<p>And if they&#8217;re already seeing a professional, offer to pick up their medications for them or help them get to their appointments on time.</p>
<h3>5. Ask them if they need someone to talk to</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the best thing you can do for your depressed friend is to just listen.</p>
<p>They have a lot of pent up emotions and just talking about them might make things easier for them.</p>
<p>Always ask if they need someone to talk to and when they do decide to talk, just listen.</p>
<p>We all want to offer quick fixes to problems at times, but when your depressed friend opens up to you, refrain from offering solutions. All you have to do is listen.</p>
<h3>6. Let them know that their lives make a difference to you</h3>
<p>A lot of depressed people think that they do not matter.</p>
<p>They think that nobody would miss them if they were to be gone. If you can sincerely and honestly tell your depressed friends how much they matter to you, then do it.</p>
<p>Let them know that they have someone who would miss them. Let them know that their lives make a difference to you.</p>
<h3>7. Tell them you understand (when you really do)</h3>
<p>You should only tell your depressed friend that you understand when you absolutely do. Before you say you understand, ask yourself:</p>
<p>Do you know what it feels like to be numb to the world? To have your energy sapped continuously? To lose all ability to enjoy the things that you used to take pleasure in?</p>
<p>If your answer is no, then you don&#8217;t understand. Don&#8217;t tell them that you do.</p>
<p>Because if you do say you understand and it&#8217;s obvious that you clearly don&#8217;t, it&#8217;ll feel like you&#8217;re trivializing their suffering and comparing it to yours.</p>
<p>But if you do understand what it means to be clinically depressed, tell your friend that you do.</p>
<h3>8. Let them know that they aren&#8217;t weak or defective</h3>
<p>Depression often appears to feel like a character flaw to anyone who is depressed.</p>
<p>Your depressed friend might think they&#8217;re weak or probably defective. They might feel incomplete or totally damaged.</p>
<p>You have to remind them that they are not. Let them know that depression is an illness. And the fact that they&#8217;re probably still fighting back means they&#8217;re a lot stronger.</p>
<p>Reassure them that they are not weak neither are they defective.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to understand that sometimes,you can say all the right words and your friend will still get super mad or upset at you. Your friend may even refuse to open up to you.</p>
<p>Depression isn&#8217;t something that has a specific formula, so you have to be patient with your depressed friend.</p>
<p>If it ever gets to a situation that you think you can not handle alone, call in professionals.</p>
<p>Also, people suffering from depression are at a high risk of suicide. It&#8217;s not enough that you know how to talk to a depressed friend. You should also watch out for signs of suicidal tendencies and seek professional help when necessary.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people believe that the most sophisticated cyber attacks are the biggest threats to any organization. However, the biggest cyber-security threat to a business is the people that work there.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/90-percent-of-data-breaches-are-caused-by-human-error" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">eight out of ten</a> top data theft are as a result of human error. This includes loss of paperwork, company data emailed to the wrong address, and unprotected web pages.</p>
<p>This means that every employee has a vital role to play to ensure the safety of company data. As a business owner, you have to pay more attention to increasing awareness regarding cyber-security for employees.</p>
<p>Every business, whether big or small, could experience such threats. That is why it is absolutely important to have the right cyber prevention setup for your business to grow.</p>
<p>With the ever-changing digital landscape, cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated. All businesses, therefore, need to ensure the safety of their sensitive information and the security of their networks. Being up to date with the methods used by criminals and ensuring employees are also aware of obvious dangers are necessary.</p>
<p>This post highlights five critical tips about cyber security for employees&#8217; awareness.</p>
<h3>Social engineering</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54809" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cyber-security-tips.jpg" alt="cyber security tips" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cyber-security-tips.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cyber-security-tips-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>This is a term used to manipulate others so they give up their important information. It is commonly referred to as phishing.</p>
<p>Based on an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324455350_2018_Verizon_Data_Breach_Investigations_Report" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">investigation report</a> by Verizon, 93 percent of data breaches are as a result of pretexting and phishing. Educate people working for you to be cautious while opening an email or communicating with clients on social media. They should be wary of pretext such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A request for sudden help:</strong> Your friend traveled to a different country and is currently stranded. He needs some money immediately so he can return home.</li>
<li><strong>Give to a charity:</strong> The reason for the fundraiser might be honest, but the payment link might not be.</li>
<li><strong>A request that you verify some information:</strong> Requests like this seem official and come from an email disguised as from your bank.</li>
<li><strong>An unusual request from your co-worker:</strong> If a co-worker asks for information regarding a project the organization is carrying out.</li>
<li><strong>You’ve won a prize:</strong> These messages appear to be from your lawyer, a lottery, or the IRS for a deal that is nonexistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cyber criminals usually succeed with most of these phishing messages employees act without giving much thought. Train your workers to pause and analyze situations before responding to such emails.</p>
<h3>Password management</h3>
<p>According to research conducted in 2017 by OneLogin, less than 31 percent of <a href="https://www.amazingsupport.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">IT services</a> require their employees to change passwords monthly. Password management is a major challenge for business owners as it regards cyber security. With IT decision-makers failing to remind employees, there needs to be a major change in attitude if you want to improve your cyber security.</p>
<p>Additionally, teach your workers to make use of strong passwords. Trace Security conducted <a href="https://www.tracesecurity.com/blog/articles/81-of-company-data-breaches-due-to-poor-passwords" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">research</a> and discovered that 81 percent of data theft is connected to weak passwords. When selecting strong passwords, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a combination of numbers, letters, and special characters.</li>
<li>Get creative.</li>
<li>Choose something you can remember and that is impossible to be guessed.</li>
<li>Avoid using personal information like your name, pet names, birth dates, and family names.</li>
<li>Don’t share your passwords with anybody.</li>
<li>Use a password that is unique for every device.</li>
<li>Regularly change your passwords.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Email usage</h3>

<p>Most businesses depend on emails daily for both external and internal communications. Since emails are the primary delivery methods for computer malware, employees need to know how to responsibly use them. They should exhibit caution when clicking on emails and opening attachments under these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Received from a strange email</li>
<li>An unusual tone</li>
<li>Having strange characters and wrong spellings</li>
<li>Your antivirus doesn&#8217;t clear the file</li>
<li>The attachment seems unusual</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unauthorized software</h3>
<p>A quick way for viruses to infect your computers is by downloading software from sources that are unknown. Even software that appears innocent, such as a game, could have ransomware, spyware or other malicious codes. Have a policy in place regarding what software employees can and cannot install on company computers.</p>
<h3>Using the internet</h3>
<p>Carry out training for your employees to avoid opening unfamiliar links on the internet or from sources that seem suspicious. Such links might download malicious software that could potentially infect your computers and put them at risk. Establish safe browsing guidelines for using the internet in the office, and let your IT support workers educate other employees on these rules.</p>
