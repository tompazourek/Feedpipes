    <title>5 ‘Order Review’ Implementations That Make Office Depot Best-in-Class</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115171-fbfa83065570c2d206b40259f812b00a.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When considering Checkout Optimization, the “Order Review” step shouldn’t be overlooked, as we consistently observe in our large-scale checkout usability testing that issues encountered here can easily &lt;strong&gt;cause users to abandon&lt;/strong&gt; — even this late in the checkout flow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the abandonments observed at this point in the flow are very often solely due to the checkout design and flow — as in, they are &lt;strong&gt;entirely preventable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, after benchmarking 60 major e-commerce sites on Checkout UX performance, and analyzing the 300 manually reviewed UX parameters specifically for “Order Review” steps, we find that 65% of e-commerce sites have an “Order Review” user experience that ranges from poor to just acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s possible to excel at this critical checkout step: the top-ranked site in our &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt; is the office supply store &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/office-depot"&gt;Office Depot&lt;/a&gt;, which has a best-in-class “Order Review” UX performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article we’ll explore the &lt;strong&gt;5 “Order Review” implementations&lt;/strong&gt; that Office Depot excels at, but which many e-commerce sites fail at. Specifically, we’ll show you some of our large-scale checkout &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research"&gt;UX research&lt;/a&gt; findings that relate directly to the  ‘”Order Review”’ step, and how you can ensure your “Order Review” step aligns perfectly with common user behavior:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow users to edit data directly at the “Order Review” step (38% get it wrong)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a &lt;em&gt;“Place Order”&lt;/em&gt; button above the fold at the “Order Review” step (23% get it wrong)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimize the “Order Review” step for skimming (11% get it wrong)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What information to display at the “Order Review” step (12% get it wrong)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have edit links in close proximity to each semantic group at the “Order Review” step (38% get it wrong)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you have Baymard Premium access see the full guidelines for each implementation discussed below by going to the &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/premium/topics/425"&gt;“Order Review” topic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="1-allow-users-to-edit-data-directly-at-the-order-review-step-38-get-it-wrong"&gt;1) Allow Users to Edit Data Directly at the ‘Order Review’ Step (38% Get It Wrong)&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During our large-scale checkout usability testing, users at the “Order Review” step were often observed to &lt;strong&gt;find errors&lt;/strong&gt; in their order information, which they naturally wanted to edit before finalizing the order. This is in itself a positive thing, as it justifies the presence of the review step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115172-375aaf6562957e204e13e105072d6601.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, during testing, the task of editing data at the “Order Review” step was often observed to be a &lt;strong&gt;cumbersome process&lt;/strong&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; links would send users backwards in the checkout flow, causing a great deal of confusion and frustration both when moving backwards in the checkout flow and when moving forward again after corrections had been made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users who are sent back in the checkout flow are prone to make &lt;strong&gt;additional errors&lt;/strong&gt; as they are yet again presented with a set of choices and options, which they had already completed the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after being sent backward in the flow and editing the information, the user now will have to &lt;strong&gt;move forward again&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not only confusing, and may introduce new validation errors, but was also experienced by users during testing as &lt;strong&gt;highly discouraging&lt;/strong&gt;, as they had to go through the same checkout steps they’d completed several minutes earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115173-06274e6c49bfeada1a7123b2f96c5a6a.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution lies in allowing users to &lt;strong&gt;edit data at the “Order Review” step&lt;/strong&gt;, either inline (for simple information like quantity and contact numbers) or via a page overlay (for more complex information like address and payment data).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If, however, users must be forced to go backwards in the checkout flow to edit data (e.g., for legal or security purposes), then at least ensure that users then can return directly to the “Order Review” step (e.g., by adding a &lt;em&gt;“Return to Order Review”&lt;/em&gt; button and functionality).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ve identified that failing at this particular implementation represents a &lt;strong&gt;“Missed Opportunity”&lt;/strong&gt; within e-commerce in general — many sites (38%) fail to address this UX issue, despite it having a significant UX impact for the end user.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="2-have-a-place-order-button-above-the-fold-at-the-order-review-step-23-get-it-wrong"&gt;2) Have a ‘Place Order’ Button Above the Fold at the ‘Order Review’ Step (23% Get It Wrong)&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During testing, &lt;strong&gt;11.6%&lt;/strong&gt; of users misinterpreted an “Order Review” step for a “Confirmation” step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t surprising, given that the “Order Review” and “Confirmation” steps are often &lt;strong&gt;more or less identical&lt;/strong&gt;. They typically both contain product information, an order cost summary, and a summary of the user’s just-typed address details and selected shipping method.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, they are often (though not always) both presented after the user has typed in all data (e.g., payment data) and performed all selections necessary to technically place the order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115174-82252d13d1af956b99927551a6d1c45b.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users during testing who misinterpreted an “Order Review” step for a “Confirmation” step consequently &lt;strong&gt;left the checkout&lt;/strong&gt; without having placed their order. Adding to the tragedy, these users did so in good faith believing that their order was successfully placed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, failing to have a &lt;em&gt;“Place Order”&lt;/em&gt; button at the top of the “Order Review” step can be the &lt;strong&gt;sole cause for up to an 11% abandonment rate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These users are furthermore likely to require extensive customer support later on when they’re angered about why their order hasn’t arrived, yet customer support will have a hard time helping these frustrated customers, as there’s no placed order to look up — a scenario likely to lead to &lt;strong&gt;permanent brand damage&lt;/strong&gt; as users are left with two poor experiences in a row.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115175-6b6aec814d4ed522278c61176100df08.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution we observed in testing to resolve this issue is to place &lt;strong&gt;a second &lt;em&gt;“Place Order”&lt;/em&gt; button above the fold&lt;/strong&gt;, or to make it “sticky”. One of the main differences between an “Order Review” step and the “Confirmation” step is the presence of a &lt;em&gt;“Place Order”&lt;/em&gt; button. Being able to spot the primary button is therefore a great help to the users who use the site content, not the headline, to deduce which step they are on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to prominent placement of the &lt;em&gt;“Place Order”&lt;/em&gt; button, the primary button throughout the checkout flow (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Continue to Payment”&lt;/em&gt;) must also be &lt;strong&gt;consistently placed&lt;/strong&gt; so that users can easily find it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a &lt;strong&gt;“Confirmation” Process step&lt;/strong&gt; should be included as well, to offer users further information scent and reinforce the fact that they’re only at the “Order Review” step, not the “Confirmation” step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, resolving this issue will be &lt;strong&gt;“Low Cost”&lt;/strong&gt; for most sites, when compared to fixing other checkout issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="3-optimize-the-order-review-step-for-skimming-11-get-it-wrong"&gt;3) Optimize the ‘Order Review’ Step for Skimming (11% Get It Wrong)&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During our checkout testing, just over half of users tested &lt;strong&gt;skimmed, rather than thoroughly read&lt;/strong&gt;, the information and options presented at the different “Order Review” steps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This observed behavior in and of itself is a fine way to approach the “Order Review” step. Yet testing revealed it leads to issues when (1) new information is included at the “Order Review” step or (2) data and options not directly related to the actual order dominate the content of the step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115176-33f7266132e65dce74751e103ee90967.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, if users quickly skim the “Order Review” step and find that there’s a mismatch between the displayed information and the memorized data, this will &lt;strong&gt;draw their attention&lt;/strong&gt; away from other, often more important, pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, if users have seen one order total throughout the checkout process and then at the “Order Review” step get presented with a price that contains an added tax, users will no longer be able to “recognize” the order total — thus the elements will draw attention, and can result in &lt;strong&gt;users feeling “duped”&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Why did they hide this until the very end?”)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;unnecessary distraction&lt;/strong&gt; draws attention away from what the actual point of the “Order Review” step is — to allow users to check for errors in their typed data. If users aren’t checking for errors because they’re focused on new information, there’s an increased chance they’ll submit incorrect data, which could lead to abandoning the order. (Some may also abandon because they feel “tricked”, depending on the new information that’s added at the “Order Review” step.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, testing revealed that users’ attention was time and again observed to be drawn towards elements such as graphically highlighted text or elements that required interactions (such as buttons and empty form fields).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the highlighted elements represent actual order information to be reviewed (e.g., an &lt;em&gt;“Estimated Arrival Date”&lt;/em&gt;) or critical page elements (e.g., the &lt;em&gt;“Place Order”&lt;/em&gt; button), this is &lt;strong&gt;generally a good thing&lt;/strong&gt;, as it helps users review the order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115177-d0181d4f4761a5555d8c69e5ccc369ca.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s however &lt;strong&gt;problematic&lt;/strong&gt; if the user’s few seconds of brief skimming is spent on ads, deals, and “Exclusive Sign Up” offers, elements that don’t help the user evaluate the purchase and actually lessens the chance of the user detecting possible errors in the order data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115178-bb3f25cd51e1080bd0351c65d74c15e1.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “Order Review” step should therefore not waste the eye gaze and attention of users who skim the step on non-order information or new order information that could have been displayed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it to some extent is true that errors in the order are the user’s own fault if they only spent a few seconds scanning the “Order Review” step, it’s still the harsh reality that it will add up to an overall &lt;strong&gt;negative shopping experience&lt;/strong&gt;, and the issues caused may require extensive customer support resources to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ve identified that this implementation is a &lt;strong&gt;“Web Convention”&lt;/strong&gt;: nearly all (89%) sites adhere to this implementation. Consequently, users have come to expect that the “Order Review” step on all sites is optimized for skimming. When it isn’t, it has a more severe impact on the end user, as it breaks their expectation of how an “Order Review” step should perform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="4-what-information-to-display-at-the-order-review-step-12-get-it-wrong"&gt;4) What Information to Display at the ‘Order Review’ Step (12% Get It Wrong)&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During testing, some users proved that the “Order Review” step wasn’t superfluous by actually using it to edit their data and correct errors in their order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, users can only make such corrections at the “Order Review” step if they’re presented with the relevant prior-typed data and selections, and both are formatted to be easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, all prior-typed data and selections should be presented at the “Order Review” step. Moreover, there are details to consider when it comes to displaying the various pieces of information and selections. These are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="shipping-and-contact-info"&gt;Shipping and Contact Info&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115179-7636d1e2badb038c4b65c466b35d67af.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Address scannability&lt;/strong&gt;. Addresses should be presented in a standard format and broken into multiple lines, as it’s easier to scan and parse a multiline-formatted address than a single-line address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) The user’s email address&lt;/strong&gt;. Users may have multiple email addresses, and the email address is prone to being mistyped (especially on mobile). Testing showed that users rely on the confirmation email to serve as their “receipt” and therefore an incorrect email address that’s not corrected at the “Order Review” step will cause severe issues at the “Confirmation” step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Autoformat the user’s phone number&lt;/strong&gt;. To heighten scannability, consider autoformatting the number — for example, &lt;em&gt;(123) 456-7890&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;1234567890&lt;/em&gt;, or however the user inputted it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for shipping information consider also indicating if &lt;em&gt;“Billing = Shipping”&lt;/em&gt;, to allow the subgroup of users who want to use different addresses to double-check that the correct one is being used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider avoiding abbreviations and using the full forms of words instead (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Maine”&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;“ME”&lt;/em&gt;), as abbreviations are more likely to be overlooked by users scanning the information compared to the full forms of words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="payment-details"&gt;Payment Details&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115180-3d78cfd3c9b5231ca27cea8e25a5715f.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Display the last four digits of the credit card number&lt;/strong&gt;. To help users recognize the credit card used, display the last four digits of the applied card. For security reasons, the last four digits are typically the only ones possible to display.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) The card expiration date&lt;/strong&gt;. Some users might have multiple stored cards of the same type (e.g., two VISA cards). To help users as much as possible it is therefore advisable to also display the expiration date for the applied card. The expiration date will resonate well with some, as the card that expires the latest will usually also be the newest card — for example, a user with two VISA cards will from the expiration date on the “Order Review” step often be able to tell if they are about to use “the old VISA card”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, consider displaying the card logo, which provides a way for users to instantly recognize the card type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="shipping-method-and-estimated-arrival"&gt;Shipping Method and Estimated Arrival&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115181-739d0814622bc610cab071d0dd2d7c51.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Provide an estimated arrival date instead of shipping speed&lt;/strong&gt;. Figuring out the finer details of the postal services can be extremely cumbersome for users — for example, &lt;em&gt;“Do they ship today or tomorrow and do they deliver Saturday?”&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast, the site is much better equipped at calculating when the product will arrive. Therefore, &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/shipping-speed-vs-delivery-date"&gt;provide the estimated arrival date&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Thursday, April 8”&lt;/em&gt;) rather than shipping speed (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“3–5 Business Days”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, consider including the shipping method and speed. If a user has chosen a different shipping method than the site’s default, it can help to specify the shipping speed and costs to help users understand how the estimated arrival date was determined — for example, &lt;em&gt;“Estimated Arrival Date: 6–7 July (expedited 3-days shipping, $12)”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="price-and-products"&gt;Price and Products&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115182-c754d7f3aa3d7d7177d86308cf976342.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Make the order total the most prominent price&lt;/strong&gt;. The “Order Review” step often does (and should) display several monetary amounts. This is in itself not necessarily a problem and informing users of “how much they save”, for example, is quite fine. However, it is important that the &lt;em&gt;total price&lt;/em&gt; — the price users will actually pay — is the most prominent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Provide a cost breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;. Users strongly dislike not knowing what they are paying for, and are generally hostile towards “surprises” at the “Order Review” step — for example, a new, higher price. Therefore, display a total cost breakdown (e.g., including sales tax and delivery and other fees), which allows users to deduce how the total price was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) Have thumbnails for all products&lt;/strong&gt;. Thumbnails make products quickly recognizable, while providing users with an easy, visual way to verify that they are indeed buying the right products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Display product quantities&lt;/strong&gt;. To ensure users are aware of how much of a product they are buying, quantity should be visible at the “Order Review” step. Consider also allowing users to alter quantities at the “Order Review” step, in particular if the checkout flow allows users to bypass the cart (as the “Order Review” step is then a user’s first encounter with their cart contents).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, consider providing tooltips for taxes, fees, and other information (e.g., as Office Depot does for &lt;em&gt;“Delivery Speed”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="5-have-edit-links-in-close-proximity-to-each-semantic-group-at-the-order-review-step-38-get-it-wrong"&gt;5) Have Edit Links in Close Proximity to Each Semantic Group at the “Order Review” Step (38% Get It Wrong)&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As described in item #1, users should be allowed to edit their data at the “Order Review” step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, however, it &lt;strong&gt;must be obvious&lt;/strong&gt; which &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; link belongs to which block of information (e.g., shipping address, payment details, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115183-66b36fb511d5cf71ecc71afdadbe025c.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, testing revealed that many users will have trouble associating an &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; link with its corresponding information group — and consequently &lt;strong&gt;won’t use it&lt;/strong&gt;, which can result in a slowed-down checkout or even an abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115184-e64cab7fd9b044e53c2c99cd131d1c5e.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue is &lt;strong&gt;typically caused&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; links not being proximate to their relevant information group or a discrepancy between what information sites consider to be semantically related and what information users consider to be semantically related (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Shipping Address”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“Shipping Methods”&lt;/em&gt; as one or two groups of information).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/office-depot-order-review-experience" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-115185-4fb7542217f535d7296c35473a5e3cb2.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The solution is straightforward&lt;/strong&gt;: have an &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; link for each semantic group, and place the &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; links next to their information groups at the “Order Review” step, so that it’s clear from a quick visual scan which &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; link belongs to which information group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It may help to think of the &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; links as &lt;strong&gt;directly connected&lt;/strong&gt; to a specific information group (e.g., a set of form fields or selections) rather than a shortcut to a specific checkout step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, even if &lt;em&gt;“Billing Address”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“Payment Methods”&lt;/em&gt; are handled at the same checkout step, they will &lt;strong&gt;require individual &lt;em&gt;“Edit”&lt;/em&gt; links&lt;/strong&gt; to align with user expectations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="perfecting-the-order-review-user-experience"&gt;Perfecting the ‘Order Review’ User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As noted in the introduction to this article, &lt;strong&gt;65%&lt;/strong&gt; of sites fail to reach a “good” level of performance for the “Order Review” user experience. While it may be tempting to settle for an “acceptable” performance, consider that “Order Review” is a critical step in checkout — problems here have been observed during testing to be the direct cause of checkout abandonments, which is a shame when users are one click or tap away from completing their order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Office Depot exemplifies however how it’s possible to have an excellent “Order Review” performance. In particular, the site excels at&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allowing users to edit data directly at the “Order Review” step (38% get it wrong),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having a &lt;em&gt;“Place Order”&lt;/em&gt; button above the fold at the “Order Review” step (23% get it wrong),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;optimizing the “Order Review” step for skimming (11% get it wrong),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;presenting the necessary information and selections at the “Order Review” step (12% get it wrong), and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having edit links in close proximity to each semantic group at the “Order Review” step (38% get it wrong).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Office Depot, along with some of the other top-performing sites (e.g., &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/foot-locker"&gt;Foot Locker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/crutchfield"&gt;Crutchfield&lt;/a&gt;), can be considered as sources of inspiration when trying to improve the “Order Review” experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To see Office Depot’s “Order Review” experience and UX performance in detail head to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/office-depot"&gt;Office Depot’s site review&lt;/a&gt; or consider viewing some of the 103 “Order Review” design examples available in the &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/checkout-usability/benchmark/step-type/order-review"&gt;Page Design feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Checkout Optimization: From 16 Form Fields to 8 Fields (keynote presentation)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/checkout-optimization-from-16-fields-to-8"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Baymard’s checkout research, we’ve found that on average &lt;strong&gt;26% of users have abandoned&lt;/strong&gt; purchases during the checkout flow solely because the checkout flow was too long or too complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, our most recent 2019 checkout UX &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt; — which was updated just 1 week ago with 7,900+ new manually rated checkout UX performance scores for the world’s 60 largest e-commerce sites — show that the average e-commerce site in &lt;strong&gt;2019 has 12.8 form fields in their checkout flow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While 12.8 fields in 2019 is a 14% improvement compared to the 14.88 form field average we &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/checkout-flow-average-form-fields"&gt;measured in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still too high when considering that sites can achieve a &lt;strong&gt;checkout flow with as little as 6-8 form fields&lt;/strong&gt; (for a “guest checkout” flow incl. the credit card fields).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the below keynote presentation, Baymard’s research director Christian Holst will walk you through a selection of Baymard’s checkout &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research"&gt;research findings&lt;/a&gt; showing you how you can achieve an 8 field long checkout flow:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ‘Order Returns’ Experience is Critical for Customer Retention — Yet 54% of E-Commerce Sites Have a Returns Interface with Substantial Usability Issues</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101943-d5917f3691a004b2309b0f7f9c9fb4c3.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like traditional brick-and-mortar stores, returning a purchased item will always be a part of the e-commerce user experience — in fact, often more so with online shopping because the products are so often purchased without being physically seen and handled first. Indeed, our quantitative study found that 29% of users said that returning an item were among the most important reasons for accessing their e-commerce accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance of returns, during our large-scale usability testing of &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research"&gt;Accounts &amp;amp; Self-Service&lt;/a&gt; experiences at e-commerce sites, the &lt;strong&gt;return processes and interfaces caused the most usability issues&lt;/strong&gt; for users during testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, our UX performance &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt; also reveal that &lt;strong&gt;54% of sites have significant usability issues&lt;/strong&gt; within their returns flow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article we’ll cover select findings on the online Order Return experiences from our research studies, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Importance of Return Experiences and How Much They Can Impact Customer Retention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Current UX Performance of ‘Order Returns’: 54% of Sites Have Significant Usability Issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 Commonly ‘Missed Opportunities’ for Online Return Experiences and Interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-return-experiences-and-how-much-they-can-impact-customer-retention"&gt;The Importance of Return Experiences and How Much They Can Impact Customer Retention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101944-4b3f0366a02d7a7e6cead0bd40c3bd7b.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to 29% of users who deem the returns feature as one of the most important reasons for signing into their e-commerce account, our quantitative research also shows that 53% of online shoppers returned at least one item in the past year to an e-commerce site and that 7% of users deliberately buy variants of an item with the upfront intention of returning the items that are not suitable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our Checkout study we found that &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate#why-users-abandon"&gt;11%&lt;/a&gt; of users have abandoned at least one order in the past quarter &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; due to an unsatisfactory returns policy at the site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101945-a03fb05c756dff2d5926ab449f1bfd68.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve also found that users base part of their perception of a site — and their decision of whether they’ll make another purchase — on their returns experience. In fact, our quantitative study found that &lt;strong&gt;7% of users would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; again purchase from the last site they returned an item to&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; due to the site’s returns experience, while an additional 13% of users would be unlikely to purchase from that site again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the returns process and experience is crucial to a site’s ability to attract, convert, and especially to retain customers. Despite this we find that &lt;strong&gt;54% of sites have significant usability issues&lt;/strong&gt; within their returns flow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="the-ux-performance-of-order-returns-54-of-sites-have-significant-usability-issues"&gt;The UX Performance of ‘Order Returns’: 54% of Sites Have Significant Usability Issues&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="anecdote-graphic-dn32ja anecdote-module-3ba83n v-size-big v-border-none"&gt;&lt;div class="inner"&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark" class="anecdote-intrinsic-embed-n42ha1"&gt;&lt;div class="inner" style="padding-bottom: 12.168792934249264%;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.baymard.com/research/media_files/attachments/35081/original/research-media-file-2bce06852bbb43a7d73322b13f641c9f.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the 660 manually assigned UX performance ratings our research team have set when benchmarking the entire returns flows at the 42 largest e-commerce sites in the world reveals that 54% of e-commerce sites have significant UX performance issues within their ‘Order Returns’ flow. A small group of sites (21%) mitigate the overall poor picture with decent to good performances, along with a small handful of sites even having a “State-of-the-Art” implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When analyzing this dataset and from our usability testing, it’s clear that the reasons for poor ‘Order Return’ experiences are numerous and very much interwoven. Often a handful of UX issues, in various degrees of severity, occur in sequence. Combined they often cause users to face direct roadblocks, where some users will have to contact customer service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="5-commonly-missed-opportunities-for-online-return-experiences-and-interfaces"&gt;5 Commonly ‘Missed Opportunities’ for Online Return Experiences and Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our benchmark reveal that the following five aspects of the return UI and flow are often missed by e-commerce sites:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30% of sites don’t have an online return feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;21% of sites outsource the return functionalities to third-party courier sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;65% of sites do not provide users an easy way to save the return label at the end of the return flow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50% of sites don’t promote in-store returns alongside mailed return options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;55% of sites don’t update the order status after a return is initiated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h3 id="1-30-of-sites-dont-have-an-online-return-feature"&gt;1) 30% of Sites Don’t Have an Online Return Feature&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101947-7bec32d611ffb700f5622ac2d422b154.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30% of sites don’t have an online order return feature&lt;/strong&gt; at all but instead rely on including a pre-printed return label with the order. While pre-printed return labels were observed in testing to often be a good thing, as it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; significantly reduce the return friction, it should always be supplemented with an online order return flow. In addition to the obvious issues with lost return labels, even when a return shipping label is provided, in testing it was shown that a subset of users are uncomfortable with simply “sending an item back” without first alerting the site that the item is on the way. (Premium users: for more implementation details see guideline &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/premium/guidelines/894"&gt;#894&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="2-21-of-sites-outsource-the-return-functionalities-to-third-party-courier-sites"&gt;2) 21% of Sites Outsource the Return Functionalities to Third-Party Courier Sites&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;21% of sites outsource their order returns UI or entire experience to a third-party vendor (e.g. Narvar, FedEx, UPS, Royal Mail, etc.). While this is probably good in terms of internal resources the site has to spend on creating a returns flow and process, it causes a complete lack of control over the end-customer’s return experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve detailed in our recent article &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info"&gt;Self-Service UX: Integrate All Order Tracking Info and Events Within the E-Commerce Site Itself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, outsourcing order tracking and order events to third-party vendors — rather than being integrated within the e-commerce site itself — during testing caused it to be harder to access, understand, and navigate for end-users. Even the handful of third-party vendors who have clearly made an effort in trying to provide a good flow and UI, the lack of a coherent experience and lack of complete account data and features (only available at the e-commerce site) still cause usability issues, and are a limitation of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="3-65-of-sites-do-not-provide-users-an-easy-way-to-save-the-return-label-at-the-end-of-the-return-flow"&gt;3) 65% of Sites Do Not Provide Users an Easy Way to Save the Return Label at the End of the Return Flow&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Printing the return shipping label is frequently the last step in the return flow. However, our testing revealed that many users will not print the label when they complete the return shipping process. This was observed to be the case for 67% of users during our remote in-home testing, who cited printer issues or the lack of a printer as reasons for having to postpone printing the return label to a later time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101949-c7a39894d521ae895300adeb63d925c4.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our benchmark reveal that it’s 65% of sites that do not provide users with an easy way to &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; the return label at the end of the return flow. If printing a shipping label appears to be the only option, it can in many cases lead to users being anxious about their ability to eventually print the label and complete the return process. This in turn can escalate to a phone call to customer service or live chat initiation, and delay a user’s ability to ship the item back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101950-1cba7bb3bbdbc2e4c918da8daeacd1c6.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Automatically emailing the shipping label to the user (regardless of whether or not the user prints the label after concluding the return flow) will address the needs of those who desire to postpone printing the shipping label.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it is not enough to silently email the label. The fact that an email has been sent with the return label should be stated clearly once users complete the return flow, so that they are not left guessing what their options are if they do not have a printer immediately accessible.  (Premium users: for more implementation details see &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/premium/guidelines/867"&gt;#867&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="4-50-of-sites-dont-promote-in-store-returns-alongside-mailed-return-options"&gt;4) 50% of Sites Don’t Promote In-Store Returns Alongside Mailed Return Options&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101951-2c7829310bde345c9ad5fb68012c49e2.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our testing revealed that failing to present in-store returns directly within the UI for, and as an equal alternative to, the return-by-mail options, makes it needlessly difficult for users to notice the free and same-day in-store return option, and consequently makes it less likely that they’ll take advantage of it. (Identical to our other checkout-related findings on how &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/store-pickup-as-shipping-option"&gt;Users Overlook ‘Store Pickup’ When Not Presented as a Shipping Option&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a missed opportunity, as this is not only a competitive advantage over most online-only sites, but a clear subgroup of users are observed to prefer in-store returns for reasons such as cost, convenience, faster refunds, and easier exchanges — as further explored in our article &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/promote-in-store-returns"&gt;Promote In-Store Returns Alongside Mailed Return Options&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="5-55-of-sites-dont-update-the-order-status-after-a-return-is-initiated"&gt;5) 55% of Sites Don’t Update the Order Status After a Return is Initiated&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The progress of the order return process can be as important to users as the progress of the order itself, as users will be intensely focused on the status of their refund or exchange.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A successful return and a refund can be of great importance to users and to their perception of the e-commerce site. The goal for users is to get a refund, which, depending on the cost of the order, can involve a significant amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101952-df35714d3a3c15e64a74c082806f2ce0.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101953-8e9a59ef3b44f9c0f07fb5dc90af229f.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination of the importance of getting a refund and likely lack of knowledge of the return process makes it critical for e-commerce sites to keep users updated on the progress of returns in ways that keeps users informed and matches their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, during testing it was observed that users on some e-commerce sites were unsure about whether specific stages of the returns process were successfully completed and were not clear when the refund might be issued. In many ways the doubts, confusion, and anxiety are identical to the ones we observe users to exhibit on sites that don’t have an “order cancellation pending” status — further detailed in our article &lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/cancellation-requested-order-state"&gt;Have a ‘Cancellation Requested’ Order State&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101954-af77baf969e017193ee9635bcec76983.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/order-returns-ecommerce-ux" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101955-f4f82c9a7ec210e37be7840b6d9f3b94.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without timely and accurate updates on the progress of a return, users who are concerned about whether and when a refund will be received are likely to seek assistance from a customer service representative. As one user stated during testing, &lt;em&gt;“After drop off [of the returned item, ed.], I would check my credit card for a reverse charge a week later, and check the site. Another week later I would call customer service”&lt;/em&gt;. Users should be able to see what the stages of the return process are, work out when each stage is likely to be completed, and receive status updates when the item has been received by the website and the refund has been made. It is in the interest of both users and e-commerce sites to update the status of returns quickly and transparently. (Premium users: for more implementation details see guideline &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/premium/guidelines/922"&gt;#922&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="focussing-on-the-return-experience"&gt;Focussing on the Return Experience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Considering how many returning customers can easily be lost in the returns experience (up to 20% of customers), we observe surprisingly many severe UX issues at even larger sites. In particular considering many of these issues are relatively simple to address as they relate to “just” the returns user interface, the returns flow, and the information presented along it (as opposed to the return policy itself, which is obviously a business strategy decision).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the benchmark dataset clearly reveal that sites have an even higher number of specific usability issues to resolve in their returns flow, most will be able to use the five commonly missed opportunities address in this article, as a starting point for improving their return experience:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30% of sites don’t have an online return feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;21% of sites outsource the return functionalities to third-party courier sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;65% of sites do not provide users an easy way to save the return label at the end of the return flow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50% of sites don’t promote in-store returns alongside mailed return options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;55% of sites don’t update the order status after a return is initiated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, for inspiration on return flows, consider taking a closer look at &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/amazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/best-buy"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark/case-studies/wayfair"&gt;Wayfair&lt;/a&gt; who all perform quite well. In our Page Designs tool you can also see 52 design examples of &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ecommerce-design-examples/64-order-returns"&gt;Order Return UIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UX Research on Product Page Videos: Where and How to Embed Them (35% Get it Wrong)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/embedding-product-page-videos"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/embedding-product-page-videos" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101935-2388632e10fc24db6086f653e36fc239.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine investing resources into expensive video production and implementing video players on your e-commerce site, and then your users don’t watch the videos! Now imagine that the reason they don’t watch your videos is not because they don’t want to, but because they &lt;strong&gt;can’t find them&lt;/strong&gt; on the product page… well, that’s precisely the risk 35% of major e-commerce sites are running due to where and how they embed videos on their product pages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During our large-scale &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/product-page"&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt; usability testing, 41% of users &lt;strong&gt;watched product videos&lt;/strong&gt;. Now some users simply dislike the video format and will very rarely (if ever) watch product videos, hence the significant chunk of 59% of users who didn’t watch videos. But for the 41% of users who &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; seek out video, the content made a big difference in their product page experience, helping them to imagine how the product might fit into their own life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Video content can therefore be a &lt;strong&gt;great addition&lt;/strong&gt; to your product pages, but it is obviously worthless if the users who are looking for the videos can’t find them. Our usability research showed that the placement and design of videos greatly impacted their discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this short article we’ll go over our research observations on &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to embed videos on product pages so users can easily find them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="where-to-place-videos-on-the-product-page"&gt;Where to Place Videos on the Product Page&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discovery plays a major role in video utilization. After all, users must be able to find videos in order to watch them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When videos were placed far away from the image gallery on the product page, some users had &lt;strong&gt;trouble finding&lt;/strong&gt; the video content during our testing. As a user remarked when stumbling upon a video far down a product page: &lt;em&gt;“So there it is. Lots of scrolling down. That’s not what I would have expected at all… I would think the video would be right in the overview.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/embedding-product-page-videos" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101936-caf6c6914b49576fbf03c681fde3eb27.jpg" style="width:500px;height:auto;" alt="" width="500" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our usability tests showed that users generally expect images, videos, 360° views, and similar visual content, to be &lt;strong&gt;placed together&lt;/strong&gt; at the product page, because they see videos and 360° views as &lt;em&gt;supplements&lt;/em&gt; to the product images. Hence users expect to find videos located next to the main product images on the &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/product-page/benchmark/page-designs/product-page"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testing also confirmed the web convention of placing image galleries at the top of the product page to be a de facto user expectation. During testing, users virtually always looked at the &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;image gallery&lt;/strong&gt; (even if they didn’t interact with it) when they landed on the product page. Having videos located here therefore greatly increases their discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus videos and 360° views should be placed at the top of the product page, mixed with or next to the product image gallery. (Note that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; videos should be placed here — not just some of them. Some of the tested sites only included one video in the main image gallery despite having multiple videos available for the product — alas, some users would only ever discover the single video included in the image gallery.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/embedding-product-page-videos" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101937-35e17547b6735a1121e448e82f8f581f.jpg" style="width:500px;height:auto;" alt="" width="500" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that repeating the videos elsewhere on the product page is perfectly fine. So long as the videos are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; available in the image gallery, it is great to have them embedded in content sections throughout the product page as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="how-to-integrate-and-design-the-video-thumbnails"&gt;How to Integrate and Design the Video Thumbnails&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The short version: just mix videos into the normal image gallery thumbnails and overlay them with a “play” icon and you’re golden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/embedding-product-page-videos" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101938-65e6f60270cb68ffe05123771e10f34b.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t use tabs&lt;/strong&gt; to separate the video and image thumbnails in the image gallery. A third of the tested users had trouble with this design. (Generally we observe that &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/avoid-horizontal-tabs"&gt;tabs&lt;/a&gt; often cause severe discoverability issues.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testing showed that there was no need to separate video and image thumbnails — users were perfectly capable of &lt;strong&gt;discovering and distinguishing&lt;/strong&gt; product videos from images, as long as they had some sort of “play” icon, and were displayed next to or as part of the image gallery thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/embedding-product-page-videos" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101939-202b047e120175cbcf5481ae29cb1fa0.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/embedding-product-page-videos" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101940-b43ab86b4a728036a852cfb6ce489fce.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the thumbnail design itself, testing showed that all that mattered was that videos had some sort of &lt;strong&gt;“play” icon&lt;/strong&gt;. It was fine if the thumbnail also included a still frame from the video with the “play” icon overlaid, but this wasn’t necessary — a standalone “play” icon worked equally well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So in summary, to make sure the users looking for your product videos can actually find them:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place videos in or alongside the product image thumbnails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure the video thumbnails have a “play” icon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feel free to repeat the videos in other content sections elsewhere on the product page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not overly complicated, but better double-check your site’s implementation — our &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; showed that 35% of major e-commerce sites fail to get these details right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101916-d2e8c700e73848c96f3efed679ef6481.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carousels are &lt;strong&gt;declining in popularity&lt;/strong&gt; on e-commerce sites, especially on the homepage. Our most recent UX &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt;  reveals that only 28% of the top US and European e-commerce desktop sites have a carousel — down from 32% when we measured it in 2016 and 52% in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While our large-scale usability testing reveals that users generally like the large imagery of carousels, a homepage carousel can cause more harm than good if the inherent &lt;strong&gt;serious usability pitfalls&lt;/strong&gt; aren’t addressed. In short; we do find that homepage carousels &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; work with users, but in practice almost all carousels don’t, and the list of detailed requirements is long.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, our UX benchmark reveals that only &lt;strong&gt;41%&lt;/strong&gt; of the sites that have a homepage carousel have an implementation that’s largely free from usability issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, during our usability testing we also observed an &lt;strong&gt;alternative homepage design pattern&lt;/strong&gt; that technically is vastly simpler to get right than a perfectly implemented homepage carousel and that performs well with users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll discuss the test findings from our e-commerce &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/homepage-and-category-usability"&gt;Homepage &amp;amp; Category&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/mcommerce-usability"&gt;Mobile&lt;/a&gt; usability studies related to homepage carousels. In particular, we’ll discuss and show our test findings on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deciding whether having a homepage carousel is even the right choice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why autorotating carousels are problematic on mobile sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 UX requirements for designing a user-friendly homepage carousel for both desktop and mobile sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 additional UX requirements for desktop carousel autorotation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 additional UX requirements for mobile carousels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 id="deciding-whether-having-a-homepage-carousel-is-even-the-right-choice"&gt;Deciding Whether Having a Homepage Carousel is Even the Right Choice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we set all the commonly observed and quite severe usability issues aside for a second, we do find, that if implemented with great care, a homepage carousel can be a useful way to promote features, offers, and product-finding wizards. Mainly as many users are &lt;strong&gt;enticed&lt;/strong&gt; by the typically large images and autorotation helps expose a variety of content without cluttering up the entire homepage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carousels therefore &lt;strong&gt;can perform decently&lt;/strong&gt; — as long as the implementation itself and carousel content is crafted very carefully (most aren’t).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101917-284d8db693d17aff0f03fe43c9cd1b45.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, we’ve observed in testing a &lt;strong&gt;well-performing alternative to homepage carousels&lt;/strong&gt; that’s technically vastly simpler, and which can be employed on both desktop and mobile sites. This alternative is to simply use static content sections scattered throughout the homepage in combination with featured categories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This static content sections design alternative relies on users simply vertically scrolling the webpage — a &lt;strong&gt;vastly simpler&lt;/strong&gt; and much more ingrained web interaction than interacting with a site-specific carousel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, before implementing a carousel on the homepage, consider whether it may be better to simply use &lt;strong&gt;static content sections&lt;/strong&gt; — and avoid the headaches that can occur when trying to implement and maintain a homepage carousel perfectly. For most e-commerce sites choosing the static content sections and then spending the tech resources a carousel implementation would have required on other &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog"&gt;UX issues&lt;/a&gt; will be a better tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101918-5a15e27830d09e34ec81c8406817a577.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a carousel is &lt;strong&gt;never better than its content&lt;/strong&gt; — if the content isn’t relevant, well-curated, high-quality, and mobile optimized, the experience will never be good. Additionally, our usability testing revealed that carousel content can mislead users as well if it’s not carefully chosen — to the extent that some users misunderstand the type of site they’ve landed on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, another requirement when deciding whether to implement a carousel on the homepage is to ensure there’s high-quality content for the carousel slides (although static content sections will suffer from poor content as well).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you, or someone else in your organization, have a very strong preference for using a homepage carousel, and also have the needed resources, then read the rest of this article, as the rest will outline the &lt;strong&gt;9 requirements for making homepage carousels perform ok&lt;/strong&gt; that our large-scale mobile and desktop usability testing have revealed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="why-autorotating-carousels-are-problematic-on-mobile-sites"&gt;Why Autorotating Carousels are Problematic on Mobile Sites&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, on desktop sites &lt;strong&gt;autorotation of slides&lt;/strong&gt; is a very good idea as it helps spread exposure across slides and clarifies that it is indeed a carousel and not a single static homepage banner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On mobile sites, however, the story is different. The key difference between mobile and desktop sites, when it comes to autorotating carousels, is the &lt;strong&gt;lack of mouse hover&lt;/strong&gt; on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On desktop a user’s intentions can be inferred when they’re hovering a carousel image with their mouse cursor — that is, it’s very likely that they’re reading the slide content and we can therefore pause the autorotation. On mobile sites, however, the lack of a hover state means this crucial insight into likely user intent can’t be gleaned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101919-0ed763bfce5b5bddd2cc4cadc68aa235.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consequently, during mobile testing users viewing content in an autorotating carousel were often distressed to have the slide change before they’d finished reading. Or, worse, some users attempted to tap a slide to learn more about what was featured — only to have the &lt;strong&gt;slide change at the last second&lt;/strong&gt;, resulting in an unintended detour to a random landing page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When this detour is noticed by users it’s often “just” &lt;strong&gt;an unnecessary frustration&lt;/strong&gt;, as nearly all users during testing quickly recovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, for the smaller sub-group of users who do not notice it, it will result in these &lt;strong&gt;users misunderstanding the content&lt;/strong&gt; they view after they’ve tapped the carousel slide, as the content is likely to not seem very relevant to the slide they tapped.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since there’s currently no way to technically avoid such untimely slide changes, carousel autorotation &lt;strong&gt;should be avoided&lt;/strong&gt; on mobile sites. The downside of a carousel that abrupt most mobile users reading a slide, and causing some users to also open a wrong slide, far outweighs the upside of spreading exposure across the carousel’s slides.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This in practice means that &lt;strong&gt;mobile carousels are deprived of their main benefit&lt;/strong&gt; (providing exposure to a variety of content through autorotation), and designers and managers have to always assume that all mobile carousel slides, beyond the first, will in practice never be viewed by the vast, vast majority of mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101920-48044314e0014ba1eaa05c62b9e1a527.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As on desktop sites, static context sections can be considered as a design alternative to a carousel, especially since autorotation should be avoided. If the carousel design must be implemented, then the carousel should be manual, and it should &lt;strong&gt;adhere to the UX principles&lt;/strong&gt; discussed below (ignoring the design requirements for autorotation, of course).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="3-ux-requirements-for-a-user-friendly-homepage-carousel-on-both-desktop-and-mobile"&gt;3 UX Requirements for a User-Friendly Homepage Carousel on Both Desktop and Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it’s determined that a homepage carousel is still the preferred choice compared to using static content sections, whether on a desktop or mobile site, then it’s important to get the following &lt;strong&gt;3 UX requirements&lt;/strong&gt; right when implementing a homepage carousel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: these requirements are completely platform agnostic and apply equally to desktop and mobile sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id="1-the-slide-sequence-should-be-chosen-carefully"&gt;1) The Slide Sequence Should Be Chosen Carefully&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101921-b540117e22128e54b713e7374edc35b9.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most users &lt;strong&gt;won’t see&lt;/strong&gt; all the slides in a homepage carousel, even if it autorotates. They simply don’t stick around the homepage for that long, and certainly not at the top of the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During testing, users would typically click onto another page or scroll past the carousel &lt;strong&gt;long before&lt;/strong&gt; a full rotation of the slides had commenced. And that was in the case of autorotating carousels — obviously “fully manual” carousels only reveal the first slide until users decide they want to see another slide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means the sequence of the slides in the carousel is &lt;strong&gt;incredibly important&lt;/strong&gt;, as the initial slide will get vastly more exposure than later ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Tip: see our article &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/mobile-homepage-usability"&gt;“42% of Mobile Homepages Risk Setting Wrong Expectations for Their Users”&lt;/a&gt; for more on how users generally behave when landing on a homepage)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="2-carousel-slides-should-never-be-the-only-route-to-features-or-content"&gt;2) Carousel Slides Should Never Be the Only Route to Features or Content&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Beyond the initial slide getting the most exposure, it can be assumed that some users &lt;strong&gt;won’t see any slides&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101922-de07e0554cb52659710d65c83313c8f6.jpg" style="width:500px;height:auto;" alt="" width="500" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During desktop (and especially during mobile) testing, many users &lt;strong&gt;immediately embarked&lt;/strong&gt; on a product-finding strategy (e.g. using search, opening the main navigation, etc.) sometimes before the page had even finished loading. Consequently, these users likely never saw the carousel content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there’s a high risk of some carousel slides suffering from &lt;strong&gt;banner blindness&lt;/strong&gt;: users skipping the carousel content, despite its prime placement, simply because it resembles an ad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101923-9bb54f5d6099d8059573a8b4c2b7a1fe.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;vital site features&lt;/strong&gt; should never be accessible only from a carousel slide, given that many users will never see it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, a product finder should never be linked to only from a carousel slide. Instead, it should also have a &lt;strong&gt;permanent link&lt;/strong&gt; in the navigation or a block on the homepage, as the product finder slide in the carousel won’t be seen by a large number of users, especially if it’s not the first slide in the carousel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="3-manual-controls-should-be-completely-clear"&gt;3) Manual Controls Should Be Completely Clear&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101924-fba750d7552ce189ff1a117403d5dce5.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having carousel controls (which for most sites are indicator dots) that are &lt;strong&gt;highly visible&lt;/strong&gt; is crucial. Otherwise, it can be as bad as not having them in the first place, as some users will simply not know they’re there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others who spot the controls may have &lt;strong&gt;difficulty interacting&lt;/strong&gt; with them if they have small hit areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101925-cdfd3cbe05b12587481ec439bf22e6ac.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attention should be paid to both the size of the dots and whether they’re visible when overlaid on top of the slide content. As the carousel slides are dynamic and will change over time, testing for high-contrast should be part of the slide content creation quality assurance process, or automated. If the dots often tend to fade into the background imagery consider separating the dots from the slide content and placing them in their own section directly below the slides.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in addition to indicator dots, consider also using arrows in the left-hand and right-hand side of the image. The next and previous arrows have the upside of being simpler to understand for more novice users.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="3-additional-requirements-for-carousel-autorotation-on-desktop-sites"&gt;3 Additional Requirements for Carousel Autorotation on Desktop Sites&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Carousel slides should autorotate on desktop sites. However, there are three implementation details specific to autorotation that must be adhered to to ensure a well-performing autorotation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="1-carousel-slides-shouldnt-rotate-too-quickly-or-too-slowly"&gt;1) Carousel Slides Shouldn’t Rotate too Quickly or too Slowly&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When slides autorotate too quickly, users feel they have &lt;strong&gt;too little time&lt;/strong&gt; to be enticed by the slide and properly evaluate the slide they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if slides change too slowly, users &lt;strong&gt;grow impatient&lt;/strong&gt; if the active slide doesn’t grab their attention and move on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101926-9218b4b1d481a6c18a98bfda445196b7.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on how much text the slides include, a good rotation time often seems to be around &lt;strong&gt;5–7 seconds&lt;/strong&gt; for slides with just a header and a few tags or labels, while more text-heavy slides may demand as much as 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="2-autorotation-should-be-paused-on-hover"&gt;2) Autorotation Should Be Paused on Hover&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the user hovers the carousel with the mouse cursor, &lt;strong&gt;autorotation should pause&lt;/strong&gt; so the user can focus on the slide for as long as they’d like, and, more importantly, so the slide doesn’t change just as the user decides to click.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During testing, carousel slides were often observed changing just milliseconds before a subject clicked — causing the wrong page to be loaded. Obviously this is a frustrating experience, and, in some cases, it &lt;strong&gt;can be downright harmful&lt;/strong&gt; if the user doesn’t realize what happened and instead begins browsing a completely irrelevant page until they either start over or abandon the site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101927-152471666710fb22803bd7f5110d7440.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is therefore &lt;strong&gt;absolutely critical&lt;/strong&gt; to pause the slides on mouse hover — an important feature currently missing from 18% of all benchmarked sites that have a homepage carousel (making it no wonder that most report poor performances on their carousels implementations).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The autorotation can begin again once the user’s cursor leaves the carousel if the user hasn’t otherwise interacted with the carousel — after all, the hover could just be temporary, with the user moving the mouse across the screen to get to another element on the homepage. In these cases, &lt;strong&gt;starting the autorotation again&lt;/strong&gt; helps spread exposure across the slides, which is typically desirable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="3-autorotation-should-be-stopped-after-any-active-user-interaction-with-the-carousel"&gt;3) Autorotation Should Be Stopped after Any Active User Interaction with the Carousel&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, we observe &lt;strong&gt;an exception&lt;/strong&gt; to restarting the autorotation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the user has interacted with the carousel beyond hover (e.g. actively changed a slide), the autorotation &lt;strong&gt;should be permanently paused&lt;/strong&gt; — even when the user isn’t hovering the carousel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101928-e95831cb1f73670d1fbeaf4352a2c9fa.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the user has actively changed the slide by clicking the “next” or “previous” buttons or slide indicators, the selection is likely to be intentional and should not be changed just because the user decides to check out other parts of the homepage (before potentially returning to their selected slide).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="3-additional-requirements-for-mobile-carousels"&gt;3 Additional Requirements for Mobile Carousels&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For mobile sites, a manual carousel should be implemented instead of an autorotating carousel (if not just using static content sections). However, we observe that are an additional three mobile-specific design implementations that must be adhered to, to ensure a well-performing manual carousel on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="1-mobile-gestures-must-be-supported"&gt;1) Mobile Gestures Must Be Supported&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general mobile users have &lt;strong&gt;come to expect&lt;/strong&gt; to be able to use mobile gestures — for example, the “swipe” gesture to change to the next slide — when interacting with websites on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101929-699c8bf19668a012b196258de82c755e.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean traditional carousel controls such as “next” or “previous” buttons and slide indicators can’t be implemented, but testing showed that these should be provided in addition to supporting the swipe and pinch gestures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="2-slide-text-must-be-legible"&gt;2) Slide Text Must Be Legible&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We frequently observe, when &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/audits/site-element"&gt;auditing&lt;/a&gt; mobile sites that feature a carousel, that the &lt;strong&gt;carousel artwork is reused directly from desktop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101930-ddd2aa777d569d206c37dadfdb02534a.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a major problem so long as one is careful in ensuring that any &lt;strong&gt;text in the slides remains legible&lt;/strong&gt; when scaled all the way down to a tiny mobile screen held in portrait mode. Ideally any text in the carousel slide is real HTML text and not embedded in the image (this is typically also better for accessibility and SEO).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 id="3-carousel-content-must-be-able-to-load-quickly"&gt;3) Carousel Content Must Be Able to Load Quickly&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, users tend to have &lt;strong&gt;less patience&lt;/strong&gt; for slow-loading content on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This should be kept in mind when considering what content to include in carousels as users will quickly lose patience with content that takes more than a second to load (e.g. highly graphical or animated content).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As one user during testing put it while waiting for a page to load, &lt;em&gt;“It’s just slow now. [Tapping fingers.] I don’t know whether that is my internet connection or my phone or whether it’s the website. So, who do I direct my impatience to? At this stage I would normally go okay. I’d go ‘no’ and go out of the website and go on to something else…the website should be faster…it’s bad for me personally because I just don’t have the patience…if it was going on too long, I would just go on and search for them somewhere else.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="ensure-carousels-adhere-to-all-the-implementation-details--or-opt-for-static-content-sections"&gt;Ensure Carousels Adhere to All the Implementation Details — Or Opt for Static Content Sections&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/homepage-carousel" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101931-8fddfb15b60882abd5c697ce3726eec8.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, despite some users responding well to the large imagery found in carousels, they often end up doing more &lt;strong&gt;more harm than good&lt;/strong&gt; due to the many nuances and implementation required to achieve a decent carousel performance. Again, even among the largest e-commerce sites, our benchmark reveals that of the 28% of sites that still use a carousel, 41% of the implementations have major usability issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To sum up, &lt;strong&gt;desktop and mobile&lt;/strong&gt; sites must both adhere to the following 3 carousel implementation details:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The slide sequence should be chosen carefully&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carousel slides should never be the only route to features or content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manual controls should be completely clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desktop&lt;/strong&gt; sites, with autorotating carousels, must adhere to the additional 3 implementation details:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carousel slides shouldn’t rotate too quickly or too slowly (around 5-10 sec.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autorotation should be paused on mouse hover&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Autorotation should be stopped after any active user interaction with the carousel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;mobile&lt;/strong&gt; carousels should be manual (they shouldn’t autorotate), and must adhere to 3 additional implementation details:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile gestures must be supported&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text must be legible, especially if reusing and scaling down artwork from the desktop site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carousel content must be able to load quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If adhering to these 9 implementation details across desktop and mobile sites is too difficult or resource intensive, we recommend implementing the simpler, but well-performing, &lt;strong&gt;static content sections&lt;/strong&gt; on both the desktop and, especially, the mobile site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Product Page UX: Data Should Be Synchronized Across Product Variations (28% Don’t)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101893-f9e832f099943db33c893bfd5938eb27.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our large-scale UX research on e-commerce product pages reveal that 28% of sites are suffering severe user experience issues related to how they handle &lt;strong&gt;product variations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specifically, our product page usability testing showed that users couldn’t properly evaluate the products they were interested in when product variations weren’t interlinked or (more commonly) information about a product &lt;strong&gt;wasn’t synchronized&lt;/strong&gt; across its variations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, having a description of materials for the blue variation of a t-shirt but not for the red variation. Or having 31 user reviews for the red variation of the t-shirt, but then only 9 user reviews for the blue variation, instead of combining them into a total of 40 user reviews displayed across both color variations. It’s one of our core product finding axioms:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="anecdote-pull-quote-sba2ha anecdote-module-3ba83n v-size-big"&gt;&lt;div class="inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the user can’t find it, it doesn’t exist (to them)” — Baymard Institute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such separation of core product content across the variations of the same product is harmful to the user experience as users inevitably &lt;strong&gt;miss out&lt;/strong&gt; on content that is critical to their purchasing decision. Indeed, during our usability test sessions, we observed this to be a direct cause for product and site abandonments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101894-8293177ba3b055937bf5bf71d69708a4.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beware if you think this is simple or self-evident — our product page benchmarking revealed that 28% of major e-commerce sites &lt;strong&gt;fail at this&lt;/strong&gt;. While most sites do recognize the importance of interlinking product variations and manage to do so, surprisingly many (we’re talking 1 in 4 sites!) fail on the second part: ensuring that core product information is replicated across all product variations so the user can fully evaluate the product regardless of which variation they happen to be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to create a state of the art product page user experience you must, however, go further than interlinking product variations and synchronizing their information: you must also label variation-specific information to help users grasp the differences that do exist between the available variations. And there are of course &lt;strong&gt;exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; to the rule: images should ideally be unique for each variation. Yet, when that isn’t feasible due to the cost of producing unique images for all variations of the product, then variation-specific images should actually be &lt;em&gt;carefully&lt;/em&gt; mixed with universal product images and video.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sharing information across products is clearly fraught with potential issues, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing it and consequently providing your users with &lt;strong&gt;insufficient&lt;/strong&gt; visual information about each variation is even worse. So the question isn’t whether this should be done, but rather how to do it — and that is precisely what we’ll explore in this article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Table of contents:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product variations must be interlinked to enable easy discovery and cross-navigation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All “core content” should be replicated across all variations of the product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variation-specific content should be labeled accordingly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dealing with the special-case of images and how to avoid prohibitive content production costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 id="product-variations-must-be-interlinked"&gt;Product Variations Must Be Interlinked&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core issue: When product variations aren’t interlinked, many users will simply assume they don’t exist or aren’t available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During our testing, failing to interlink product variations proved to be the direct cause for product and site abandonments, because users &lt;strong&gt;couldn’t find&lt;/strong&gt; the product variation they wanted and therefore (falsely but understandably) concluded that the site didn’t carry that item. It’s back to that product finding axiom: if the user can’t find it, it doesn’t exist (to them).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101895-23e1eea3c23e8670424d0f0107609bb8.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When observing an issue like this it is important to appreciate that the severity is two-fold: there’s the obvious loss of a sale here and now. However, what’s less obvious is that a &lt;strong&gt;misalignment&lt;/strong&gt; occurred, too: the user concluded that the site didn’t carry that item, and therefore ended up with an inaccurate mental model of the site’s product catalog, perceiving it as being more narrow than it actually is. The site is thus liable to suffer long-term consequences, too, as those users are unlikely to return when looking for similar products, since users rarely go to sites they believe not to carry the items they are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It should be pretty self-evident, that if a user doesn’t believe you have a certain product, they won’t think of you when looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101896-be2288422389bd21ca8ee54777637da4.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even those users who know (or simply guess) that other variations of the product are available on the site will have a needlessly difficult time navigating to them when the variations aren’t interlinked. In other words, the best-case scenario of failing to interlink product variations is that you provide a bad user experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point it is hopefully painfully clear that the page for variations of the same product should be interlinked to &lt;strong&gt;aide discovery&lt;/strong&gt; and enable easy cross-navigation. Interlinking product variations is one of the most fundamental aspects of product page UX, and there are zero observed pitfalls to doing it — “get this right or go home”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside: Interestingly, interlinked product variations may be thought of as a special type of ultra-relevant &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/product-page-suggestions"&gt;alternative product recommendation&lt;/a&gt; — they help the user narrow in on “just the right item” once they’ve nailed down the main characteristics of the product they’re interested in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="core-content-should-be-replicated-across-all-product-variations"&gt;“Core Content” Should Be Replicated Across All Product Variations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core issue: When important product information is sparse or flat out missing, users cannot make informed decisions about the product they are looking at.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During our product page usability testing, we observed that most users would assume that if a piece of product information wasn’t available for the variation they were currently looking at, then it wasn’t available on the site at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The users were very unlikely to explore product variations they &lt;strong&gt;weren’t interested in&lt;/strong&gt; just to see if it contained more product information. For instance, a user exploring a fridge who wanted it in stainless steel would not click on the “Black” variation just to see if there should happen to be a product video or different Q&amp;amp;A content. The thought simply didn’t occur to most users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101897-5c1d5eb8feb901df92078756b1c649b4.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users are often moving quickly when examining a product page — they may be comparing multiple different products on a site, or they may be comparing products across different sites. It is wishful thinking to expect that users will slow down long enough to view every variation for a product just to see if additional content should be available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that if product information isn’t &lt;strong&gt;replicated&lt;/strong&gt; across all product variations, some users will inevitably miss out on content that is critical to their purchasing decision. Hence our earlier product finding axiom — “If the user can’t find it, it doesn’t exist (to them)” — applies to product information, too; when users cannot find a piece of product information, that content doesn’t exist to them. And when users cannot find product information that’s important to their purchasing decision, they are naturally less likely to buy those products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101898-9bf3da3d1a9d1197769d7609ac7b16ec.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When failing to replicate “core content” across all variations of a product, the best-case scenario is that the user suspects the site may have failed to synchronize this information and actually goes through the laborious task of collecting the information they need by opening all variations of the product and mentally merging that information. During testing, we only observed users making this realization by accident, because they were unsure about which of two variations they wanted and therefore switched back-and-forth between them, and then noticed that some content was available for one variation but not the other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The more common scenario when “core content” isn’t replicated across product variations is that users conclude the information is missing, and therefore decide to go &lt;strong&gt;off-site&lt;/strong&gt; to search for the information they need to properly evaluate the product variation. The moment this happens, inertia kicks in: once a user has left a site to conduct product research, it requires a conscious effort of them to go back after having researched their options and decided on the exact item they want to buy. Worse yet, competitors suddenly get a chance to pick up the customer during their product research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101899-706ebe05e7a8582b9850febb5cbe385c.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So “core content” should be replicated across all variations of a product — but what exactly constitutes “core content”? Different users unsurprisingly have different information needs, so what’s important to one user is inessential to another. Hence a perfectly delineated categorization is probably not possible, but testing revealed that product reviews, images, videos, and product descriptions are crucially important to many users’ product-exploration strategy, while content such as Q&amp;amp;A sections and manuals were important to a subset of users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, ensure that all of this product information is replicated for all variations available. The one &lt;strong&gt;exception&lt;/strong&gt; to this is images, which is a special case that requires careful and deliberate synchronization (see the next section in this article for the precise logic and research insights related to this). If in doubt, err on the side of synchronization — during our research studies we &lt;em&gt;very rarely&lt;/em&gt; observe issues with sites having too much product information available, but &lt;em&gt;very frequently&lt;/em&gt; see issues arising from having too little.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our product page benchmarking of 60 major e-commerce sites reveals that user generated content (e.g. user reviews) is a particularly common oversight. Make sure to store and share this information across all versions of the same product. For example, a fridge that comes in black, white, and stainless steel should have one unified list of 78 reviews instead of three separate lists of 7, 60, and 11 reviews.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="variation-specific-content-should-be-labeled-accordingly"&gt;Variation-Specific Content Should Be Labeled Accordingly&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core issue: When product information is replicated across variations, the actual differences between variations can become less clear to users unless variation-specific content is labeled accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately, one potential pitfall in sharing information across product variations: it can become more difficult for users to &lt;strong&gt;discern&lt;/strong&gt; the differences that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; exist between the different variations of a product. For instance, different color variations of a t-shirt may also be made from slightly different fabrics. Similarly, a wristwatch in size ‘Small’ will naturally come in different dimensions than one in size ‘Large’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101900-dbe578268950620f3bd309461bdf094c.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101901-7c75d6f53982cf919bce9b56198ac392.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is therefore essential that variation-specific content is labeled accordingly. Most notably, product descriptions and spec sheets must &lt;strong&gt;clearly outline&lt;/strong&gt; any differences in materials, dimensions, ingredients, features, etc. It must be obvious what does and doesn’t apply to each individual variation. For user reviews, the product variation should be captured and displayed alongside the review, so in case a user writes “True to color”, the reader will know that they are talking about the “Blue” variation specifically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So while it’s important to synchronize information across all product variations, it’s equally important to &lt;strong&gt;highlight differences&lt;/strong&gt;. When there are important differences between product variations that are of legitimate concern to users, make sure that this is clear by having proper labeling of variation-specific content so users can make those distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="video-and-images-are-the-exception-to-the-rule-and-how-to-avoid-prohibitive-content-production-costs"&gt;Video and Images Are the Exception To the Rule (and How To Avoid Prohibitive Content Production Costs)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core issue: Ideally all video and images are variation-specific, yet producing all this content is often prohibitively expensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The below only applies to visually-driven product verticals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During our testing, product pages where all the displayed images were of the chosen variation performed the best, as the user was able to get as much &lt;strong&gt;visual information&lt;/strong&gt; about the product variation they were interested in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when certain image types were &lt;strong&gt;missing&lt;/strong&gt; from some product variations during testing (ostensibly due to the content production costs of producing numerous images for each and every product variation), the issues were severe — it was essentially a case of “missing core content”, with all the downsides that come from this as described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101902-cf469a5d0216f79860f8fe35630aa9ff.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101903-88488d5e52444e4064f2cfbb20426d5f.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, our product page usability testing also revealed that video and most image types were &lt;strong&gt;fine to re-use&lt;/strong&gt; across product variations, so long as unique variation-specific “Cut Out” and “Angle” images were provided. In other words, so long as a few images shot from different angles with a plain background were available for each variation of the product, then videos and &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/ux-product-image-categories"&gt;auxiliary image types&lt;/a&gt;, such as lifestyle, scale, usage inspiration images, could be shared across all variations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101904-d01fea2df6ff020dc1f6309713d93fe4.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having 2-4 variation-specific images typically provided users with enough visual information so that when they saw pictures of other product variations they were able to &lt;strong&gt;mentally substitute&lt;/strong&gt; it with their desired variation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We thus have a ladder of implementations, going from bad to ideal:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad: having a few variation-specific images and nothing else, with videos and auxiliary image types only being available for one variation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good: having 2-4 variation-specific “Cut Out” and “Angle” images for each variation, and then sharing videos and auxiliary image types across all variations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideal: having variation-specific versions of all image types and videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the content production costs typically associated with option #3, and the marginal benefits it provides over option #2,  option #2 will often be the best choice for most large e-commerce sites (better invest that money in other user experience improvements).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="in-summary"&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a user cannot find a product variation, or they cannot find core information about it, then in the experience of the user the content is not there. It doesn’t matter that something is technically available if the average user cannot find it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interlinking product variations is thus a no-brainer and should just be done, as there are no UX pitfalls in doing it and the downsides of not having them interlinked are major — both short-term and long-term. Most sites do get this right, but it is far from enough: for an &lt;strong&gt;acceptable&lt;/strong&gt; user experience, you must go further and ensure all core product information is replicated across all product variations so that any given variation provides the user with all the information they need to evaluate the product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/synchronize-product-data-across-variations" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101905-cec60c275395ddeb7ff9a1466fda5151.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This sharing, however, does require some special handling:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Variation-specific content must be &lt;strong&gt;labeled&lt;/strong&gt; accordingly so users can easily grasp and understand the differences that do exist between the variations, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visual product information is a special-case, where auxiliary images and videos may be &lt;strong&gt;re-used&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid prohibitive content production and maintenance costs, so long as 2-4 variation-specific images with a plain background and from different angles are available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Getting all of this right apparently isn’t easy, because our benchmarking reveals that &lt;strong&gt;28%&lt;/strong&gt; of major e-commerce sites fail at it. Make sure you aren’t one of them by seeing to it that all of your product variations are interlinked and that their information is carefully synchronized and labeled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Self-Service UX: Integrate All Order Tracking Info and Events Within the E-Commerce Site Itself (56% Don't)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101881-ef1d93b2ac76231dbf78fb8204ccb175.jpg" style="width:400px;height:auto;" alt="" width="400" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After completing an online order, many users are interested in &lt;strong&gt;following their order&lt;/strong&gt; as it progresses through the various stages of order processing and shipment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our large-scale &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/self-service"&gt;Accounts &amp;amp; Self-Service&lt;/a&gt; usability testing revealed that users track their order at &lt;strong&gt;many different times&lt;/strong&gt; — ranging from immediately after completing the checkout (e.g., to see if it’s processing) to several days after submitting the order (e.g., to check on the status and learn when to expect it).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when the order tracking information was provided via third-party tracking or shipping sites — rather than being integrated within the e-commerce site itself — users during testing found it harder to access, understand, and navigate the order-tracking details.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, by not providing tracking information on the site itself, sites are &lt;strong&gt;giving up control&lt;/strong&gt; over the end user experience — which our testing revealed is often poor on third-party tracking sites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet our UX &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; reveals that &lt;strong&gt;56%&lt;/strong&gt; of e-commerce sites fail to integrate all tracking information and events within the site itself — relying instead on a third-party tracking site to provide the information users need at what can often be an anxious and critical time in the e-commerce shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll discuss the &lt;strong&gt;test findings&lt;/strong&gt; from our E-Commerce &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/self-service"&gt;Accounts &amp;amp; Self-Service&lt;/a&gt; usability study related to order tracking on third-party sites. In particular, we’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why users end up on third-party tracking sites after placing an order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 issues caused by including tracking information &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on third-party sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Benefits provided by integrating tracking information on the e-commerce site itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 id="why-users-end-up-on-third-party-tracking-sites"&gt;Why Users End Up on Third-Party Tracking Sites&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101882-1fad627fa50f76f1e8a186815383391a.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baymard’s quantitative study shows that the &lt;strong&gt;single most important&lt;/strong&gt; self-service feature for users is tracking of open orders, primarily order status and arrival date.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance to users, many sites &lt;strong&gt;outsource&lt;/strong&gt; all or parts of the order and shipment tracking to third-party sites, like the shipping courier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It may be easier and cheaper for e-commerce sites to outsource the entire order-tracking page or large parts of the tracking functionality to &lt;strong&gt;third-party courier sites&lt;/strong&gt; rather than developing and maintaining this information directly on the e-commerce site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our testing showed, however, that relying on third-party sites can pose a &lt;strong&gt;variety of difficulties&lt;/strong&gt; for users, and was consistently observed to offer a subpar user experience, compared to displaying the full order progress and shipping events directly on the e-commerce order status page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users are unlikely to go to a third-party site unless they have good reason to. In testing, users visited courier sites mainly when the e-commerce site &lt;strong&gt;forced them to&lt;/strong&gt; by not offering any other parcel-tracking interface, or when e-commerce sites had incomplete information (e.g., missing elements such as the delivery date, shipment subevents, or the name of the courier company).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These basic details are &lt;strong&gt;fundamental&lt;/strong&gt; to users who are trying to track their order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visiting a courier site to track, typically, only the parcel for the order is an extra step that can &lt;strong&gt;add significant complexity&lt;/strong&gt; to the overall user experience of placing and tracking an order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, the transition from the e-commerce site to third-party sites, and the fact that the courier sites only contain &lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt; info and not the full &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; info and features, was in testing observed to cause &lt;strong&gt;significant usability issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="3-issues-caused-by-including-tracking-information-only-on-third-party-sites"&gt;3 Issues Caused by Including Tracking Information Only on Third-Party Sites&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our testing reveals that users will often experience a mix of the following three usability issues when the e-commerce site doesn’t provide complete order-tracking information, especially when clicking on a third-party tracking link sent in an email:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101883-4f26715d11589de832f167301cde89f2.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Missing information.&lt;/strong&gt; Once the package is being processed by the e-commerce site — and, in particular, in the interim period from when it is packaged but not yet handed over to the courier — there is often a delay before the tracking page is available at the courier’s tracking page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If users click any third-party tracking link during this interim period, users will often see a message like &lt;em&gt;“No package information available”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“Status not available”&lt;/em&gt; — often for several hours or even a full day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a message is not helpful in answering a user’s predominant question: &lt;em&gt;“When will the package arrive?”&lt;/em&gt;, and is sometimes even seen to &lt;strong&gt;cause anxiety&lt;/strong&gt; as many users misread it as an error message or as indicating an issue or delay with the order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;confusion&lt;/strong&gt; in turn leads to some of these users frantically returning to the tracking page several times only to see this same &lt;em&gt;“Unavailable”&lt;/em&gt; status page, and some even reaching out to customer support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the level of anxiety, it’s &lt;strong&gt;not a good initial experience&lt;/strong&gt; after having just placed an order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the e-commerce site relies mainly on the third-party courier sites as the only form of order tracking, this means that users will not be able to get insights into the order progress when the order is still at the e-commerce site, and won’t be able to see order updates like  &lt;em&gt;“order received, not yet processed”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“order being prepared at warehouse”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“order packaged, ready for shipment”&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;“package passed on to courier”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101884-a9208be0128f4294031026ed068cbbad.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Disconnected information.&lt;/strong&gt; The third-party package-tracking site will often only show the package details, such as arrival date, shipping events, and the package’s current location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hence, if users need to see any order details (like the shipping address, order costs, or the contents of the order), need to cancel an order, contact customer service, see the product page for one of the ordered items, etc. they will simply not be able to do so, as these data are &lt;strong&gt;not available&lt;/strong&gt; on the third-party tracking page. All of these users will then need to go back to the e-commerce site’s order details/tracking page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, because the third-party courier’s webpage will seldom link back to the specific order at the e-commerce site, users will often have to &lt;strong&gt;“start from scratch”&lt;/strong&gt; by typing in the URL of the e-commerce site, signing in, navigating to open orders, and then opening the specific order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For users with multiple orders, the severity of these issues scales linearly as all those steps must be repeated for each order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101885-2ebe2fb7d39ce3932efebac1c72ebc8c.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, sometimes in testing we also observe the &lt;strong&gt;reverse issue&lt;/strong&gt;: users on the e-commerce site’s order status page lack information that is only available on the third-party courier site (e.g., the shipping subevent or whether a signature is required).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this issue is &lt;strong&gt;less severe&lt;/strong&gt;, as the order status page usually links directly to the third-party site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101886-d1e505337d835588753d666b82fa018a.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) An incoherent user experience.&lt;/strong&gt; It has been our observation over multiple years of usability testing that some users, especially more novice users, are generally uncomfortable with being taken to a completely new website after clicking a link on an e-commerce site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the new site users have to &lt;strong&gt;reorient themselves&lt;/strong&gt; and figure out why they’re there, why they were sent to the new site, and how to navigate through it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, any web switch sometimes causes &lt;strong&gt;technical or practical issues&lt;/strong&gt; (especially on mobile devices). While such issues can also occur on the e-commerce site itself, users there will have the benefit of inline help options, such as live chat or phone numbers to customer support, or can simply go back to their account dashboard or orders overview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While technical and usability issues on the third-party site are not the fault of the e-commerce site, they will still &lt;strong&gt;actively detract&lt;/strong&gt; from users’ overall order experience. Furthermore, some users won’t give the e-commerce site the benefit of the doubt (&lt;em&gt;“It’s not REI’s fault”&lt;/em&gt;) but will instead blame the e-commerce site for the poor experience, rather than only blame the third-party courier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-integrating-tracking-information"&gt;Benefits of Integrating Tracking Information&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some of the above issues can be partly addressed, most are &lt;strong&gt;inherent limitations&lt;/strong&gt; of splitting the order-tracking experience onto two different platforms, served by two different companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101887-c0bc5a266986b105c85597345a148050.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a better order-tracking experience, sites can &lt;strong&gt;provide all the tracking details&lt;/strong&gt; that users would need, such as delivery date, courier name, and shipment subevents, on their own order-tracking page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Providing order-tracking information within the e-commerce site itself was observed in testing to &lt;strong&gt;greatly reduce&lt;/strong&gt; users’ need to go to a third-party site, thereby alleviating all of the observed usability issues outlined earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101888-37044e22597eef4ff27b38333c0ee2b6.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Providing full order tracking provides several benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing a single seamless order-tracking experience, without any “unavailable states”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoiding causing doubt for users about where they are or what site they need to go to if they want to look up a specific order or shipment information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combining all order-related information on one single order page (shipping details, ordered products, order payment summary, etc.) where customer support and all other placed orders are also right within reach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101889-f5976eee3ffb693b99b837f2133ca375.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Showing all key elements of tracking information requires an &lt;strong&gt;investment in technology&lt;/strong&gt;, but there are clear benefits to users, in addition to a potential reduction in customer service interactions caused by difficulties with and confusion about third-party sites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="improve-the-ordering-experience-by-integrating-order-tracking"&gt;Improve the Ordering Experience by Integrating Order Tracking&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/integrate-tracking-info" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101890-ff11b4ba2cc3290ba47fb8392be04029.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sending all users to a third-party tracking interface, just to perform basic order tracking on such things as the arrival date or shipment subevents, causes an e-commerce site to &lt;strong&gt;lose control&lt;/strong&gt; of the end users’ order experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As observed in testing, third-party shipping sites sometimes have interface designs or terminology that are highly influenced by “shipping industry” practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shipping courier sites tend to use their own &lt;strong&gt;industry terms&lt;/strong&gt; and don’t necessarily have the same business interest in investing in an interface that’s highly optimized and provides a fully user-centric experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hence, integrating the full order-tracking details into the e-commerce site is the only way to remain fully in control of the order experience and &lt;strong&gt;prevent unresolvable UX issues&lt;/strong&gt; introduced by shipping courier sites, and prevent the friction caused by forcing all users to navigate from the e-commerce site to a third-party site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;strong&gt;56%&lt;/strong&gt; of sites don’t integrate all tracking information and events within the site itself but instead rely partially or fully on third-party package-tracking sites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Self-Service UX: Distinguish Primary from Secondary Paths in the 'My Account' Drop-Down (71% Don't)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101865-85f8feb1ca6ca1704942699a17e9c9a7.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “My Account” drop-down is a &lt;strong&gt;critical feature&lt;/strong&gt; for self-service e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, during our large-scale &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/self-service"&gt;Accounts &amp;amp; Self-Service&lt;/a&gt; usability testing the drop-down menu often served as a &lt;strong&gt;navigational anchor&lt;/strong&gt; that users would turn to over and over again, no matter what account feature they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when paths to primary and secondary account features are styled the same in the “My Account” drop-down it’s more difficult for users to access the most relevant account features — which leads to fewer users being able to complete critical account-management tasks, longer completion times for others, and a more &lt;strong&gt;negative perception&lt;/strong&gt; of the site on the whole.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While visually styling primary paths differently from secondary sounds like a “usability basic”, our UX &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; reveals that &lt;strong&gt;71%&lt;/strong&gt; of e-commerce sites fail to separate primary and secondary paths in the “My Account” drop-down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, in many cases improving the “My Account” drop-down is an instance of &lt;strong&gt;low-hanging fruit&lt;/strong&gt; — changes are often not overly difficult to implement, while a well-performing “My Account” drop-down menu can significantly aid users attempting to manage their account features.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll discuss the &lt;strong&gt;test findings&lt;/strong&gt; from our E-Commerce &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/self-service"&gt;Accounts &amp;amp; Self-Service&lt;/a&gt; usability study related to the “My Account” drop-down.

&lt;h2 id="how-to-identify-primary-account-features-in-the-my-account-drop-down"&gt;How to Identify Primary Account Features in the ‘My Account’ Drop-Down&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101866-a0e79e9c4d9e4495d0a0d5b44387a1e7.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of our self-service research, Baymard conducted a &lt;strong&gt;quantitative study&lt;/strong&gt; with 1,102 users to determine what the most widely used account features are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results indicate that &lt;strong&gt;order-related features&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., tracking, delivery dates), managing credit cards, return-related features, past orders, and links to get help are some of the most sought-after by users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note, however, that the &lt;strong&gt;site context matters&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, wishlists may be heavily used on one site, while on another they are rarely used by any users. Therefore, we recommend using &lt;strong&gt;site-specific data&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to these general results when trying to determine which account features are most important to a specific site’s users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identifying the primary account features is a &lt;strong&gt;first step&lt;/strong&gt; towards organizing and structuring the “My Account” drop-down menu, as once the primary paths are known they can be visually distinguished from the secondary paths in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="why-its-important-to-visually-distinguish-primary-from-secondary-paths-in-the-my-account-drop-down"&gt;Why It’s Important to Visually Distinguish Primary from Secondary Paths in the ‘My Account’ Drop-Down&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101867-84ac97f3a0b7b92e06253789a4e0205a.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During testing, some users were observed to get &lt;strong&gt;bogged down&lt;/strong&gt; when facing a “wall of links” in the “My Account” drop-down. Others simply felt overwhelmed — as one user put it, when scanning Amazon’s “My Account” drop-down, &lt;em&gt;“It’s sort of all over the place”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users faced with no obvious organization or information hierarchy in a “My Account” drop-down will often become victims of &lt;strong&gt;choice paralysis&lt;/strong&gt; — it’s not clear where to start to accomplish an account-management task — and will spend seconds or even minutes scanning the “My Account” drop-down before choosing a path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, once paths to account features have been placed into “primary” and “secondary” buckets, then the two groups can be &lt;strong&gt;visually distinguished&lt;/strong&gt; in the “My Account” drop-down menu to ensure the most widely sought-after paths are the most prominent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is most important for sites with many “My Account” drop-down links (e.g., more than 10), though sites with fewer links may still want to make primary paths more visually prominent than secondary paths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101868-83d3e061d88633723beb5a57cced18ba.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some sites in testing relied on &lt;strong&gt;list order&lt;/strong&gt; to indicate the relative importance of paths, with the most important paths placed first and the less-important paths following.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may be sufficient for “My Account” drop-downs with a very small number of links (e.g., 5 or fewer); however, for “My Account” drop-downs with more links it’s &lt;strong&gt;not enough&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure users are able to easily and efficiently navigate the “My Account” drop-down menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During testing, it was observed that users would &lt;strong&gt;sometimes skip links&lt;/strong&gt; they were looking for, even if those links were placed among the first few in the “My Account” drop-down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if the order of the links is based on usage data, an individual user doesn’t know (or care) what the most used links are: they’re only interested in &lt;strong&gt;finding the specific link&lt;/strong&gt; they’re looking for, for their current, specific, account-related task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101869-055b0fab251f634c8efcbde1c6f69bba.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101870-7c909f15ca644610aa10ddfedbdb9f2e.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary account features&lt;/strong&gt;, which are often links to promotional content (e.g., store credit cards) or subareas of the account (e.g., specific lists or optional memberships), were during testing found to be highly problematic if not carefully differentiated from primary account paths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When visually undifferentiated, users don’t know that many of the drop-down options &lt;strong&gt;aren’t relevant&lt;/strong&gt; to common tasks — like looking up an order, changing the password, adding an address, updating an expired credit card, changing newsletter settings, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consequently, users have to &lt;strong&gt;carefully read and consider&lt;/strong&gt; each of the unstyled secondary paths — making it more difficult to quickly find the account feature they’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101871-3de16326d5f0d4a57b7d9077ae9d8029.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these secondary account features don’t necessarily have to be removed from the “My Account” drop-down menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, consider treating secondary account features similarly to how “thematic” and inspirational content should be treated in the site’s &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/homepage-and-category-usability/benchmark/page-types/drop-down-menu"&gt;main product drop-down navigation&lt;/a&gt;. That is, placing these secondary paths &lt;strong&gt;in a separate column&lt;/strong&gt;, placed after primary paths, and using a visual style to indicate the lower priority, such as secondary font styling or a faded background color. The exact styling decision matters less than simply using a differentiated style for secondary account features.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="6-ways-to-further-improve-the-performance-of-the-my-account-drop-down"&gt;6 Ways to Further Improve the Performance of the ‘My Account’ Drop-Down&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Identifying the primary paths is the first step toward improving the “My Account” drop-down, and visually distinguishing primary from secondary paths is the second. Below are &lt;strong&gt;6 additional implementation details&lt;/strong&gt; to consider when attempting to improve the performance of the “My Account” drop-down, which we observed in testing to help users navigate the menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101872-21cd241898020fd120e419e9982c2121.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Make the ‘Account Dashboard’ link more prominent.&lt;/strong&gt; Every “My Account” drop-down won’t be able to meet the needs of every user, some of whom will be looking for a very specific account feature which isn’t included in the “My Account” drop-down menu, or which may be included but for whatever reason the user doesn’t recognize it (e.g., due to the terminology used).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it’s important that the “My Account” link that leads to the account dashboard — often called “My Account”, “Profile”, or “Account Settings” — is &lt;strong&gt;more prominent&lt;/strong&gt; than the other links, including other primary links, included in the “My Account” drop-down. That way, users are nudged to begin on the dashboard if they don’t immediately find the link they’re looking for in the “My Account” drop-down menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This also supports the behavior observed for a distinct subgroup of users who treat the dashboard as a &lt;strong&gt;navigational anchor&lt;/strong&gt; (the same way some users treat the “My Account” drop-down menu), quickly navigating to the dashboard even if the path they’re looking for is available within the “My Account” drop-down menu, in the courtesy navigation, or elsewhere on the interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, the path to the &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ecommerce-design-examples/58-account-dashboard"&gt;account dashboard&lt;/a&gt; should be &lt;strong&gt;placed first&lt;/strong&gt; in the “My Account” drop-down, but also consider increasing the size of the path to the dashboard relative to other paths or using a distinctive icon or eye-catching graphic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101873-010baac7017119f163fbee514bf1e95c.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Use columns and headers.&lt;/strong&gt; Columns and headers are frequently used in &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/main-navigation-product-categories"&gt;product navigation drop-downs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/footer-needs-return-shipping-links"&gt;footers&lt;/a&gt; to organize links, and are a good way of organizing paths when there are many for users to consider. The same pattern can help organize “My Account” drop-downs with many links into thematically similar sections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101874-99443af5137979816318f341a54263c3.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Use icons for crucial paths.&lt;/strong&gt; Icons can help provide information scent and draw users’ attention to their corresponding link text. Icons are however easy to overuse, and thus should be employed sparingly — for example, to draw extra attention to the primary paths in the “My Account” drop-down or solely for the path to the “My Account” dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101875-b0e55e050b4c7516b0a5057c4cf91636.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Use horizontal separators.&lt;/strong&gt; Horizontal lines are effective at separating content — for example, primary from secondary paths, or grouping paths into themes (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Account Settings”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“Delivery and Returns”&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), which adds helpful structure to the “My Account” menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101876-2fbd2a84ee5caf3c10e42c12ce8a68c7.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Provide secondary text descriptions.&lt;/strong&gt; Secondary text descriptions — often used in product-navigation menus — are the technically simplest way of clarifying the meaning of an ambiguous account path. These inline descriptions can be used for those paths that are the most ambiguous and thus the most likely to be misinterpreted. On desktop sites, a simple tooltip (or even the link hover title) can also be used for such descriptions to avoid cluttering the navigation menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101877-8a06742b9fcfc538bcef416c410a54ef.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Offer some personalization.&lt;/strong&gt; Personalizing the “My Account” drop-down to adapt it to the individual user’s context can make the “My Account” drop-down even more useful for a subset of users. Users who are able to, for example, see their rewards balance upfront in the menu will have useful information at their fingertips, without being required to navigate to the account rewards page. Personalization can also take the form of removing or deemphasizing paths that the user doesn’t currently have access to or isn’t using (e.g., the &lt;em&gt;“Wedding Registry”&lt;/em&gt; path in Amazon’s drop-down likely is only relevant to a small subset of the site’s users, who might then access it quite frequently).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="help-users-quickly-access-the-account-features-theyre-looking-for"&gt;Help Users Quickly Access the Account Features They’re Looking For&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/account-drop-down-structure" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101878-c9eedfb73187d5dc5de519e62992b916.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;inspiration&lt;/strong&gt; on “My Account” drop-down structure and styling sites can often turn to their own &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/homepage-and-category-usability/benchmark/page-types/drop-down-menu"&gt;main product drop-down navigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many sites, it’s clear a good deal of thought (and resources) has been given to how to design the main product drop-down navigation, and most of the same design choices and principles can be adapted for the “My Account” drop-down menu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;strong&gt;71% of sites&lt;/strong&gt; fail to provide even basic structuring to the “My Account” drop-down by separating primary from secondary content — potentially because the difference between the two has never been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, to improve the overall performance of the “My Account” drop-down consider adopting some combination of the following 6 implementation details:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the dashboard link more prominent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use columns and headers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use icons for crucial paths&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use horizontal separators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide secondary text descriptions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide some personalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopting some of the above implementation details will help ensure the “My Account” drop-down is an effective entry point for users seeking to access account features — once primary paths have been identified and made visually distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-Commerce Search Needs to Support Users’ Non-Product Search Queries (15% Don't)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101854-e0e7379955f39e30ea2bc41c1fd975e6.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over many years of usability testing we’ve observed that on e-commerce sites users &lt;strong&gt;rely on onsite search&lt;/strong&gt; for more than just finding products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, during our &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/self-service"&gt;Accounts &amp;amp; Self-Service&lt;/a&gt; usability testing &lt;strong&gt;34%&lt;/strong&gt; of users tried to search for non-product content (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“return policy”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“unsubscribe”&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“cancel my order”&lt;/em&gt;, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the ability of onsite search to provide relevant results for non-product queries determined whether a user was able to find what they were looking for — or whether they &lt;strong&gt;hit a dead end&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet our UX &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; reveals that 15% of e-commerce sites don’t support &lt;strong&gt;the most basic types&lt;/strong&gt; of non-product search queries, such as users searching for &lt;em&gt;“return policy”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users who are unable to find this information are &lt;strong&gt;at risk to abandon&lt;/strong&gt; if the content they’re seeking is crucial to their decision on whether to complete a purchase. For example, our &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/checkout-usability"&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt; quantitative study finds that 11% of users abandoned a checkout at least once in the previous quarter because of an unsatisfactory return policy — indicating the importance placed on this information by a subgroup of users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll discuss the &lt;strong&gt;test findings&lt;/strong&gt; from our E-Commerce &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/ecommerce-search"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; usability study related to non-product search. In particular, we’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why many users rely on search to find non-product content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 examples of non-product search queries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 ways to implement non-product search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 id="why-many-users-rely-on-search-to-find-non-product-content"&gt;Why Many Users Rely on Search to Find Non-Product Content&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101855-4c387b9f4b097ce0dd2ccbbcedb2a40d.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many types of non-product content, links to the content are &lt;strong&gt;often consigned&lt;/strong&gt; to some small corner of the page layout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Product categories typically get the primary navigation spot (&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/main-navigation-product-categories"&gt;as they should&lt;/a&gt;); however, as a consequence, auxiliary navigation to content such as help sections, return information and tools, shipping information, store locators, and more gets &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/footer-needs-return-shipping-links"&gt;relegated to the page footer&lt;/a&gt; or to other &lt;strong&gt;secondary places&lt;/strong&gt; in the main navigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, in our testing we’ve verified this is the &lt;strong&gt;recommended design practice&lt;/strong&gt; — the non-product content is secondary to the products and the design should absolutely reflect that. It does, however, mean that the content can be &lt;strong&gt;difficult to find&lt;/strong&gt; for the users who are actively looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101856-f2e16effed351df8d2eee0b16ac55d91.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where non-product search can be of &lt;strong&gt;great help&lt;/strong&gt;, especially if a user is unable to find the auxiliary content by linear navigation means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And because it is a feature of the search engine &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/ecommerce-search-query-types"&gt;logic&lt;/a&gt;, it &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t clutter the design&lt;/strong&gt; — it only appears to the users who are actively seeking it out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’ve observed this user behavior of searching for non-product information on e-commerce sites throughout multiple separate rounds, and across many years, of usability testing — so this user behavior is quite steady. For example, in our &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/self-service"&gt;Accounts &amp;amp; Self Service&lt;/a&gt; testing, &lt;strong&gt;34%&lt;/strong&gt; of test subjects tried to use onsite search to find non-product content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s clear therefore that searching for non-product content — and expecting to find relevant results — has become an &lt;strong&gt;ingrained behavior&lt;/strong&gt; and expectation for a large subgroup of users, and therefore needs to be supported.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="10-non-product-search-queries-users-often-try-to-search-for"&gt;10 Non-Product Search Queries Users Often Try to Search For&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across our testing, users searched for both &lt;strong&gt;static help and auxiliary content&lt;/strong&gt; (which explains, for example, how to return an item or how to unsubscribe from email newsletters) and &lt;strong&gt;dynamic information&lt;/strong&gt; specifically related to users’ own accounts (such as order-tracking information for a specific item).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101857-7c972f00b672aa463999439fe8f7f196.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Examples of non-product search queries include:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“return policy”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“shipping costs”&lt;/em&gt; (or variations hereof, such as &lt;em&gt;“delivery costs”&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“unsubscribe”&lt;/em&gt; (from email newsletters)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“cancel order”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“change password”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“change address”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“saved items”&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., a wishlist)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“track an order”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;”gift card balance”&lt;/em&gt; (obviously only on sites that offer gift cards)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Along with specific order-tracking numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supporting such common non-product search queries is a good start. It’s also a good idea to &lt;strong&gt;check your search logs&lt;/strong&gt; to see if there are other non-product queries that are routinely submitted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it’s &lt;strong&gt;very difficult to predict&lt;/strong&gt; what non-product content each individual user will want to find through search. As a rule of thumb, then, if there’s non-product content that users can access through navigation then it should also be accessible through search.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you notice other commonly occurring non-product queries in your e-commerce search logs, please submit them in a comment.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="two-ways-to-implement-non-product-search"&gt;Two Ways to Implement Non-Product Search&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In terms of actually providing the related content and account pages for these non-product queries,  there are in particular  &lt;strong&gt;two of approaches&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101858-033e8a7e34326d7529b880f803817819.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Include non-product content as part of regular search results.&lt;/strong&gt; This implementation simply includes non-product content on the normal search results page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a good implementation when there’s less confidence in the intent behind a user’s query. For example, more vague terms such as &lt;em&gt;“email”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“return”&lt;/em&gt; may warrant this approach — especially when there are products that match one or more of the keywords (e.g., &lt;em&gt;Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, many book titles include the term &lt;em&gt;“shipping”&lt;/em&gt; and, as seen in the earlier examples from Amazon, when the search terms contained the words &lt;em&gt;“cancel”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“unsubscribe”&lt;/em&gt; legitimate product results were returned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When displaying these non-product matches on the results page consider &lt;strong&gt;styling&lt;/strong&gt; them so that they’re visually distinct from the product-based results. For example, including an &lt;em&gt;“i”&lt;/em&gt; or help icon rather than a product thumbnail to indicate that this result is related to information and isn’t a product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101859-1ed98c17e16bb22601feb8aeb19f83e1.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101861-efbbd79d0bdd1a489f4cbd64adc53788.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Take users directly to the relevant content or task.&lt;/strong&gt; This approach requires a high level of confidence in what single page the user is looking for (because it also effectively prevents the user from searching products using those terms).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This works well for &lt;strong&gt;select and well-defined queries&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;“return policy”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“shipping information”&lt;/em&gt;. However, for more vague terms like &lt;em&gt;“shipping”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“returns”&lt;/em&gt; it may be desirable for mass merchants (and select industries) to use the first implementation approach instead, and simply include it as a top search result along with any products relevant to those keywords, as the keyword(s) may also be legitimate product searches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="support-users-expectations-of-finding-non-product-content-through-search"&gt;Support Users’ Expectations of Finding Non-Product Content through Search&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Non-product search is obviously &lt;strong&gt;critical&lt;/strong&gt; for users who can’t otherwise find the auxiliary content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/support-non-product-search" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-101862-50215ebbd6cffbb341af2985bea8042d.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, even for the users who would’ve eventually found the content via secondary-navigation options (whether they’re in the site header, a sidebar, or the footer), non-product search still serves as a &lt;strong&gt;helpful shortcut&lt;/strong&gt; to the exact content they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, many users are likely to abandon the hunt for the content or task they were attempting to find or complete (with a consequent risk of developing a negative perception of the site), go offsite to try Google (assuming that the search engine will be more robust — e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Best Buy order tracking”&lt;/em&gt;), or contact customer service, all three of which were observed during testing, with users achieving varying levels of success depending on the site and method used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;strong&gt;support non-product searches&lt;/strong&gt; by ensuring the search engine logic accounts for non-product content. Furthermore, include the non-product content in search results or take users directly to the relevant content if there’s a high degree of confidence in the user’s search query.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PDP UX: Provide an 'Included Accessories' Image and Clarify That Optional Accessories Are Extra (44% Don't)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: Unfortunately, e-mail and RSS don’t support advanced layouts and features. If the graphics in this article look strange, you may want to &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99849-784886cb82cb477b330dedebf693650d.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most users during our large-scale &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/product-page"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; usability testing attempted to &lt;strong&gt;infer product features from the product images&lt;/strong&gt; provided in the main image gallery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, images in the main image gallery are the first product page content most users will explore — &lt;strong&gt;56%&lt;/strong&gt; of users’ first actions upon arriving at a product page was to explore product images.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, knowing that a particular product has accessories included in the purchase price can be a &lt;strong&gt;deciding purchasing factor&lt;/strong&gt; for some users — as accessories can constitute both a large part of the product benefits and the total cost (if not included).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, we also observe that some users are &lt;strong&gt;reluctant to commit&lt;/strong&gt; to reading product descriptions or specs — where info on accessories can furthermore be difficult to find if provided — and instead try to quickly pick it up from product images. This is especially the case when users are in a “exploratory browsing” mode, quickly viewing multiple products before beginning to zero in on their favorites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet our UX &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; reveals that &lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt; of e-commerce sites don’t provide an &lt;strong&gt;“Included Accessories” image&lt;/strong&gt; in the main image gallery for their relevant, top-selling products. This can often be the direct cause for users wrongly discarding products as they consequently under- or overestimate the product value and costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll discuss the &lt;strong&gt;test findings&lt;/strong&gt; from our E-Commerce &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/research/product-page"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; usability study related to what we call “Included Accessories” images, as well as the related image type, “Optional Accessories” images. In particular, we’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues caused when accessories &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; depicted but &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; included in the purchase price&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues caused when accessories &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; depicted but &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; included in the purchase price&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to decide whether to show optional accessories alongside relevant products in an “Optional Accessories” image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 id="failing-to-depict-included-accessories-can-be-a-direct-cause-of-lost-sales"&gt;Failing to Depict ‘Included Accessories’ Can Be a Direct Cause of Lost Sales&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Users’ reliance on product images can be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, high-quality and comprehensive imagery can be a determining factor when it comes to a user’s decision to purchase a product. On the other hand, poor-quality imagery, or products that lack some specific image types, will cause some users to &lt;strong&gt;abandon&lt;/strong&gt; a product, as they think it won’t meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99850-79169bba0e0fd10aa74e8141711dc033.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During testing, when there was no image in the main image gallery that showed a product alongside its included accessories, many users concluded that it meant that the product then didn’t come with any accessories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99851-cc6f2f8c5287b97bc95b14684068f08e.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will directly impact sales, since users comparing two different products — one where they can see it comes with accessories, and one where they can’t see if it comes with accessories (because there’s no “Included Accessories” image provided) — will &lt;strong&gt;wrongly attribute&lt;/strong&gt; lower value to the latter product, simply because the accessories aren’t depicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the accessories that aren’t depicted are essential to the user’s intended usage of the product, it essentially means that users will misunderstand something as crucial as the product price, as most will then assume they will have to pay extra for the accessories that aren’t depicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that a product comes bundled with accessories should, therefore, be treated as an additional product feature or “bonus” and should &lt;strong&gt;always be depicted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99852-b9508b64e3a89bc04ee92256409062c0.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99853-b5b0485cfd33e49507b376e3727051af.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the “Included Accessories” image should be &lt;strong&gt;included in the main image gallery&lt;/strong&gt;, and that the included accessories should be depicted alongside the product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Placing the “Included Accessories” image in the main image gallery ensures that users will be able to find it quickly (although be aware of how images are truncated — &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/truncating-product-gallery-thumbnails"&gt;poor truncation&lt;/a&gt; can cause 50%–80% of users to overlook additional images), while placing the accessories alongside the product communicates clearly that these accessories belong to this product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an “Included Accessories” image, or included accessories information in general, is instead placed further down the product page or is buried in lengthy product text descriptions, many users will miss it entirely, or assume it’s a cross-sell for supplementary products. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;63%&lt;/strong&gt; of users during testing initially missed the fact that a mixer without an “Included Accessories” image did in fact come bundled with three premium steel accessories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, despite the importance of an “Included Accessories” image, our &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/ux-benchmark"&gt;benchmarking&lt;/a&gt; reveals &lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt; of e-commerce sites don’t include one for top-selling, relevant products.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 id="accessories-are-depicted-but-arent-included-in-the-purchase-price"&gt;Accessories Are Depicted but Aren’t Included in the Purchase Price&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When accessories are shown alongside products but are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; included in the purchase price (i.e., “optional accessories”), some users will &lt;strong&gt;misinterpret the image&lt;/strong&gt; to indicate that the accessories &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; included in the purchase price of the product (i.e., “included accessories”).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99854-6a800ac5b81e0911303621c2f4932989.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is understandable, given that, without &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/product-images-descriptive-text"&gt;descriptive text or graphics&lt;/a&gt; that clearly indicate that these are optional accessories (e.g., &lt;em&gt;“Ottoman sold separately”&lt;/em&gt;), users in practice end up relying on what they see in the product images, as not all users read the product description in full and many only scan long titles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When this occurred during testing, users felt &lt;strong&gt;greatly frustrated&lt;/strong&gt; when they finally learned that the pictured accessories weren’t included in the purchase price or, even worse, learned so only once they’d received the product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to ensure that users don’t mix up what’s included and what’s optional with the purchase of a particular product. Users love seeing that they are getting additional accessories but, on the other hand, users will often &lt;strong&gt;feel misled&lt;/strong&gt; when finding out that accessories they assumed were included in the purchase price are in fact extras.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99855-44aa2a8c9fe6cc9d302bbf583dc5c57d.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it’s important to &lt;strong&gt;make it clear&lt;/strong&gt; to users that accessories shown in an image are available but not included in the purchase price on or near the image itself — for example through the use of &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/product-images-descriptive-text"&gt;descriptive product text or graphics&lt;/a&gt;. Not having any indication stating that the accessories are optional will mislead some users to assume that the accessories are included.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99856-5723b1981cc26492eea8527616426bbe.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it’s important that the &lt;strong&gt;language used&lt;/strong&gt; to convey the fact that the pictured accessories are optional and not included is as clear as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vague language like &lt;em&gt;“Additional accessories available”&lt;/em&gt; and small disclaimers &lt;strong&gt;don’t make it clear&lt;/strong&gt; to users that they will have to pay extra for the depicted accessories. It’s better to alert users to this fact upfront rather than have them be disappointed when they find out that the accessories aren’t included in the purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt; of sites fail to clarify that optional accessories aren’t included in the purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="for-some-products-consider-depicting-optional-accessories-alongside-the-product"&gt;For Some Products, Consider Depicting Optional Accessories Alongside the Product&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A final consideration for how to treat accessories in product images is whether &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; accessories (not included in the purchase price) should be shown alongside a product (i.e., in an “Optional Accessories” image) or whether they can be shown elsewhere on the product page, separate from the product. The decision depends on how important accessories are to a particular product, as well as how many optional accessories are available for a product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, when optional accessories are a &lt;strong&gt;key feature&lt;/strong&gt; of a product, they should be included together with the product in an “Optional Accessories” image in the image gallery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the inserts for the grill at Home Depot are a key feature and a major unique selling point of the product, so it makes sense to highlight the accessories in an “Optional Accessories” image in the image gallery. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;75%&lt;/strong&gt; of users during testing quickly discovered the insert accessories from the “Optional Accessories” image.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On product pages where there are no “Optional Accessories” images in the main image gallery, users will often have a more &lt;strong&gt;difficult time finding&lt;/strong&gt; the accessories due to their less-prominent placement on the page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99857-2a56eb2ba46cc8dcf4f8895f9a7a5e32.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when optional accessories are &lt;strong&gt;less-essential features&lt;/strong&gt; of a product, then they can be relegated to a &lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/product-page-suggestions"&gt;cross-sells section&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s less crucial for users to find this information upfront.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a product has a lot of accessories available — for example, all accessories available for a laptop or camera — then they should also be relegated to a &lt;strong&gt;cross-sells section&lt;/strong&gt;, as having dozens of “Optional Accessories” images is unrealistic and unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if there are a &lt;strong&gt;few crucial accessories&lt;/strong&gt; that can be highlighted — for example, the keyboard and stylus in the Microsoft Surface example provided earlier — then it makes sense to provide an “Optional Accessories” image solely to highlight those accessories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 id="make-it-clear-what-is-and-what-isnt-included-in-the-purchase-price-through-images"&gt;Make It Clear What Is and What Isn’t Included in the Purchase Price Through Images&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99858-c4b9adba1c061adad5b68947d9387fcb.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Included Accessories” images are &lt;strong&gt;crucial&lt;/strong&gt; when users are determining if a product will suit their needs and when they are comparing similar products and prices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An “Included Accessories” image is an efficient way to provide users with &lt;strong&gt;critical information&lt;/strong&gt; quickly and will be the deciding factor for some when making their purchase decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this, &lt;strong&gt;31%&lt;/strong&gt; of sites don’t provide an “Included Accessories” image for their top-selling products that come with accessories included in the price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://baymard.com/blog/included-accessories-image" title="Click to read the article in your browser (in case this graphic looks garbled)"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.baymard.com/data-broker/graphic-99859-9fb72cf3d4a4955e1cf2650219a429ba.jpg" style="width:600px;height:auto;" alt="" width="600" height="auto" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For optional accessories, it should be determined whether products with optional accessories need to be displayed alongside their accessories in an “Optional Accessories” image, or whether it’s better to place the accessories in a supplementary cross-sells section.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the decision is made to display the optional accessories alongside the product, then it &lt;strong&gt;must be clear&lt;/strong&gt; to users that the accessories aren’t included in the purchase price of the product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;strong&gt;13%&lt;/strong&gt; of sites fail to make it clear that the optional accessories for relevant, top-selling products aren’t included in the purchase price of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
