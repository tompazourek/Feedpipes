<p>Today while we celebrate your college degree, it represents just the end of one part of your life and the beginning of the next.</p>
<p>You’ve just spent the last four years putting passion, energy and conviction into your friendships, politics, social justice, partying and &#8211; every once in a while – your classes.</p>
<p>Now your time in the classroom is over and your real education is about to begin.  Many of you will find yourselves colliding with a world driven &#8211; less by ideas, knowledge and the pursuit of truth &#8211; and more by money &#8211; ideology &#8211; and power.</p>
<p>So today, I’m going to offer you a glimpse of how the world outside of this esteemed institution really works. And offer some tips on how to be effective change agents for <em>repairing the world</em>.</p>
<p>It’s altogether fitting and proper that in a college named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Carson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel Carson</a>, to share four short stories of what happened <em>when truth and justice faced money and power </em>&#8211; for the seven years I served as a public official on the California Coastal Commission. The agency that regulates land use on all 1100 miles of the California Coast.</p>
<p><strong><em>My first story is that </em></strong><em>t</em><em>he </em><em>Smartest person in the room is almost never the most effective. </em></p>
<p>One of things I loved about being a coastal commissioner was how much I learned. Coming out of Silicon Valley and the tech world, I was a complete novice on how policy gets made. So, I had to read the<a href="https://www.coastal.ca.gov/coastact.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Coastal Act,</a> the <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=IAA26DA40D48711DEBC02831C6D6C108E&amp;transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=%28sc.Default%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coastal Regulations</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollan_v._California_Coastal_Commission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enough law</a> to understand the positions our staff took and what the applicants were contending. And each month I’d have to read through <a href="https://www.coastal.ca.gov/meetings/mtg-mm7-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 staff reports</a> to figure out how to vote. Deciding between the applicants, their lobbyists, the environmental community, the staff, the coastal act and the law.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while I was reading everything, I noticed that one of the other commissioners was reading nothing, not the staff reports, not the coastal act, not the law.  In fact, all he could do was count to seven.</p>
<p>And that ability to count to seven made him the most effective commissioner.</p>
<p>Why? Because out of 12 commissioners, seven is the number needed to win a majority in a vote.</p>
<p>While I was the master of the facts and data, he was calling in favors, cajoling others, and building a coalition to get the majority of commissioners to see the world his way.</p>
<p>So, my first lesson is &#8211; You don’t need to be the smartest person in the room to be the most effective. <em>Being effective means not just mastering the facts but &#8211; figuring out how to move your agenda forward.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>My second story is about </em></strong><em>the power of </em><em>Misdirection</em> over the truth</p>
<p>Magicians use misdirection all the time: they sweep off their top-hat, you fixate on it, and all of a sudden, their assistant standing next to them disappears.</p>
<p>I got to watch a magic act unfold before my eyes when real estate developers made eight office buildings totaling ¼ million square feet &#8212; twice the size of a Wal-Mart &#8212; disappear. How?</p>
<p>The developers wanted to build office buildings in an area zoned for farmland. Traffic from this huge project would have filled local roads not designed for this density and would impact the public’s access to the beach. Given that on the face of it, this project violated all kinds of laws, how did these developers make it disappear &#8211; <em>and</em>get unanimous approval from the county’s Board of Supervisors?</p>
<p>Their solution was brilliant – and evil. They proposed that <em>after</em> building these eight office buildings, they would build a housing facility for developmentally disabled adults. They convinced the dedicated, deserving and passionate parents of this group that this project was the only hope these families would ever have to secure housing for their children (neglecting to tell them they had located the housing for the disabled in a tsunami inundation zone).</p>
<p>Naturally these parents became vociferous advocates for the project. They brought their disabled children to the hearings and did exactly what the developers had hoped – with not a dry eye in the house, <em>no one could see the project anymore</em>. The developer had moved the attention from a project that violated local and state zoning onto a small and deserving group of individuals. It was heartbreaking. And it was world-class misdirection.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that <em>misdirection is designed to distract you from the truth</em>. <em>Obscuring a fact-based argument with a faith-based one is what demagogues do &#8211; in policy and politics</em>.  See through it. Help others to see how this kind of misdirection distorts their perspectives.</p>
<p><strong><em>My third story was about the day I learned to </em></strong><em>Follow the Money</em></p>
<p>The business model for real estate developers isn’t hard to understand &#8211; they buy farms and ranches then build houses and sell them off. And in California if you can build 1,500 houses on a 400-acre farm, that might be worth a billion dollars. Developers make their profit off the difference between the cost of the land and the net profit on the houses.</p>
<p>But one obstacle for California developers is that the Coastal Act says you can’t build on land that has been designated a Sensitive Habitat or wetland. So, if you’re a developer, having any land declared sensitive is a loss of potential revenue.  In fact, it can kill the project. However, … there is one loophole in those rules &#8211; <em>if you’re a farmer you can plow under anything</em>.</p>
<p>So as a consequence,real estate <em>developers are great farmers</em>. They buy-out family farms for prices that far exceed what the farmers could ever get from selling their crops. And then they lease the land back to them so they can continue to farm. The developers invest in equipment so farmers can plant multiple crops each year, till each and every inch of their fields, and ensure those fields are perfectly level so no water can collect on the fields.</p>
<p>When I first ran into this I thought, “Wow what a great deal. The developers are great for the environment, they’re helping farmers by making all these improvements.</p>
<p>It took me a year and lots of looking at puddles on farms for the dim lightbulb to go on over my head. <em>Real estate developers couldn’t care less about farming or the crops</em>.</p>
<p>The developers were keeping the farmers plowing the fields to make sure no sensitive habitat would appear.  And the day a developer got the zoning approvals, the bulldozers would show up to start building the houses that would bury the farm.</p>
<p>The lesson here was that <em>when I was standing in the farm field, I wasn’t looking at a puddle &#8211; I was staring at a billion dollarsv- and I didn’t see it</em>.</p>
<p>So when you hear or see something that is too good to be true – <em>follow the money</em>. It’s usually a long and winding road &#8211; but eventually you&#8217;ll find it.</p>
<p><strong><em>My final story is: </em></strong><em>if you want to make change you have to learn to communicate and inspire others.</em></p>
<p>In all these lessons, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the namesake of your school &#8211; <a href="http://www.rachelcarson.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rachel Carson</a>. You all study her work your first year here. You know she was a marine biologist at theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service – only the second woman in the job &#8211; and she served as editor-in-chief of all its publications.</p>
<p>Her 1962 book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Silent Spring</em></a>, launched the modern environmental movement.</p>
<p>The book’s title evokes a spring when all the songbirds died. Ittold the story of the damage caused by indiscriminate use of pesticides, especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DDT</a>, to control insects. It educated a mass audience, most who had never seen a scientific paper in their lives, about how these chemicals entered the food chain, accumulated in the tissues of animals and ultimately made their way up to humans.</p>
<p>DuPont and other chemical companies threatened Carson’s publisher as well as the New Yorker and <a href="https://www.audubon.org/past-magazine-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audubon Magazine</a> unless their planned <em>Silent Spring</em> features were canceled but <em>n</em><em>evertheless,</em> <em>she persisted. </em>The book was a moral call to arms for people to take personal action.</p>
<p>Rachel Carson wasn’t first to raise concerns about <a href="https://www.panna.org/resources/ddt-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DDT</a>, but her impact was to <em>communicate </em>scientific evidence in a way that the general public could understand – she used facts to <em>inspire </em>others to take action.</p>
<p>In naming this college the donors said, “Carson, like UC Santa Cruz, epitomizes love of the natural world, ethical judgment based on sound scientific principles, and the persistence and courage to create change.”</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Change happens when you can educate and inspire others &#8211; when you can use facts to create faith in what’s possible</span>.</em></p>
<p>For those of you who will continue in the sciences or research, the easy part will be to write papers for your peers. The harder part is <em>how you’ll explain “inconvenient truths” to people who may not want to hear them. How will you rouse an audience to action?</em></p>
<p><strong>Finally, </strong><em>why do public service</em>?</p>
<p>My work on the <a href="https://steveblank.com/category/california-coastal-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coastal Commission</a> took four days of my week each month in public hearings &#8211; at times in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2lE3fgj7QA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhausting 12-hour days</a>. And I’ve sat on the boards of other local and national non-profits.</p>
<p>But why serve your community, state or country? For me, I volunteered my time because of a gift I received my first year in college.</p>
<p>On my first day of school in Michigan I met Michael Krzys, who one day would be the best man at my wedding.  As we got to know each other, I pretty quickly realized that I had met my match, someone with even more curiosity, creativity and a wry sense of humor.</p>
<p>But as I got to know Michael, there was another, completely foreign part of him I didn’t understand. It would take me another 30 years.</p>
<p>From the day I met him he had a commitment to public service that was deep, heartfelt, profound, unshakable and to me, mysterious and completely unfathomable. Even as a freshman, Michael already knew that his calling was to help others and to do so he was determined to become a public service lawyer.</p>
<p>It confused and unnerved me to know someone with so much certainty about the meaning and direction of his life.  It couldn’t have been more different from mine.</p>
<p>After our first year our lives took different paths. When they would touch again, it would be in ways neither of us could have predicted.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>I left school and joined the <a href="https://steveblank.com/2012/09/04/entrepreneurship-is-hard-but-you-cant-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Air Force</a> during Vietnam, and Michael and I kept in touch via letters – me telling him about adventures in the military, fighter planes, electronics and foreign countries. His letters to me explained that while he appreciated my dedication to <em>national service</em>, <em>public service </em>was the higher calling. Each of his letters ended with him reminding me that I was destined for a different career.</p>
<p>When I got back from Southeast Asia, Michael was in Law School and <a href="https://steveblank.com/2010/05/24/ejection-seats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I was stationed nearby</a>. Over dinner we’d argue about politics, talk about how to best save the world, and he’d tell me what he was learning that week in his law school classes.  I remember when he taught me the best way to understand an issue was to learn how to argue both sides of a case.</p>
<p>When I got out of the military, Michael was finishing up law school. A year later he and his new wife headed to the South to work for <a href="https://www.glsp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Legal Services</a>.</p>
<p>I moved to Silicon Valley, and we kept up a sporadic correspondence, me trying to explain startups and Michael telling me about the world of civil rights and social justice for the poor.</p>
<p>If possible, it seemed like his excitement for what he was doing matched mine.  I just didn’t understand why he did it.</p>
<p>For entrepreneurs, understanding why people dedicate their lives to working for non-profits is hard to fathom. Why work for low pay, on something that wasn’t going to deliver a product that would change the world?</p>
<p>Today, each time I see the staffs of those non-profits I support, I get a glimpse of that same passion, commitment and sense of doing right that I first heard my freshman year decades ago.  For the best of them, it’s not a job, it’s a life-long calling. They remind me of what Michael might have become.</p>
<p>One fine California April day, three years in Silicon Valley and now into my second startup, I got a call from someone in Michigan who had been trying to track me down.</p>
<p>Michael and his wife were bringing some kids to camp, and he was killed in a head-on car accident with a drunk driver.  His wife and the kids survived.</p>
<p>It took me a long time, but as I got older, I realized that life was more than just about work, technical innovation and business. Michael and others worked to preserve and protect the values that made life worth living.  And while we were making things, they were the ones who were changing our society into a more just place to live.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a day that went by during my time on the Coastal Commission that I didn’t wonder what Michael Krzys would do. He was my model as a human being who found his own compass.</p>
<p>I always hoped that mine would point in the same direction&#8230;</p>
<p>Graduates, as you set out on your own extraordinary adventures, remember the<em> measure of a life is not time or money. It’s the impact you make serving God, your family, community, and country. </em></p>
<p><em>Your report card is whether you leave the world a better place.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<p>We just finished our 4th annual <a href="http://hacking4defense.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Defense class at Stanford</a>. At the end of each class we have each team give a Lessons Learned presentation. Unlike traditional demo days or Shark Tanks which are &#8220;here&#8217;s how smart I am, please give me money,&#8221; a Lessons Learned presentation tells a story of a journey of hard-won learning and discovery. For all the teams it&#8217;s a roller coaster narrative of what happens when you discover that everything you thought you knew was wrong and how they eventually got it right.</p>
<p>Watching each of the teams present I was left with wonder and awe about what they accomplished in 10 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The eight teams spoke to over <em><strong>820</strong></em> beneficiaries, stakeholders, requirements writers, program managers, warfighters, legal, security, customers, etc.</li>
<li>By the end the class all of the teams realized that the problem as given by the sponsor had morphed into something bigger, deeper and much more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our keynote speaker was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/palmer-luckey-21a16959/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palmer Luckey</a>, founder of Oculus and the designer of the Oculus Rift. He&#8217;s now the CEO/founder of the AI-focussed defense contractor <a href="https://www.anduril.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anduril Industries</a>.</p>

<div class="entry">
<p><strong>Presentation Format<br />
</strong>Each of the eight teams presented a 2-minute video to provide context about their problem.</p>
<p>Followed by an 8-minute slide presentation follow their customer discovery journey over the 10-weeks. All the teams used the <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission Model Canvas</a>, Customer Development and Agile Engineering to build Minimal Viable Products, but all of their journeys were unique.</p>
<p>All the presentations are worth a watch.</p>

<p><strong>Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship</strong><br />
This class is part of a bigger idea &#8211; Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship. Instead of students or faculty coming in with their own ideas — we now have them working on societal problems, whether they’re problems for the State Department or the Department of Defense, or non-profits/NGOs, or for the City of Oakland or for energy or the environment, or for anything they’re passionate about. And the trick is we use the same Lean LaunchPad / I-Corps curriculum — and kept the same class structure – experiential, hands-on, driven this time by a <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>mission</em>-model</a> not a business model.</p>
<p>Mission-driven entrepreneurship is the answer to students who say, “I want to give back. I want to make my community, country or world a better place, while solving some of the toughest problems.”</p>

<p><strong>It Started with an Idea<br />
</strong>Hacking for Defense has its origins in the Lean LaunchPad class I first taught at Stanford in 2011. I observed that teaching case studies and/or how to write a business plan as a capstone entrepreneurship class didn&#8217;t match the hands-on chaos of a startup. And that there was no entrepreneurship class that combined experiential learning with the Lean methodology. Our goal was to teach both theory and practice.</p>
<p>The same year we started the class, it was adopted by the National Science Foundation to train Principal Investigators who wanted to get a federal grant for commercializing their science (an SBIR grant.) The NSF observed, “The class is the scientific method for entrepreneurship. Scientists understand hypothesis testing” and relabeled the class as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF I-Corps</a> (Innovation Corps). The class is now taught in 9 regional locations supporting 98 universities and has trained over 1500 science teams. It was adopted by the National Institutes of Health as<a href="https://sbir.cancer.gov/programseducation/icorps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> I-Corps at NIH</a> in 2014 and at the National Security Agency in 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Origins of Hacking For Defense<br />
</strong>In 2016, brainstorming with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petenewell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pete Newell</a> of BMNT and <a href="http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/joseph_felter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Felter</a> at Stanford we observed that students in our research universities had little connection to the problems their government as well as the larger issues civil society was grappling with. Wondering how we could get students engaged, we realized the same Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps class would provide a framework to do so. That year <a href="http://hacking4defense.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Defense</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Diplomacy</a> (with Professor Jeremy Weinstein) with the State Department were both launched at Stanford.</p>

<p><strong>Goals for the Hacking for Defense Class<br />
</strong>Our primary goal was to teach students Lean Innovation while they engaged in a national public service. Today if college students want to give back to their country they think of <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teach for America</a>, the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peace Corps</a>, or <a href="http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americorps</a> or perhaps the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/united-states-digital-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Digital Service</a> or the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSA’s 18F</a>. Few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community or other government agencies.</p>
<p>Next, we wanted the students to learn about the nation’s threats and security challenges while working with innovators inside the DoD and Intelligence Community. While doing so, also teach our sponsors (the innovators inside the Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community (IC)) that there is a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats. That if we could get teams to <em>rapidly</em> discover the real problems in the field using Lean methods, and <em>only then</em> articulate the requirements to solve them, could defense acquisition programs operate at <em>speed and urgency</em> and deliver <em>timely</em> <em>and needed </em>solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to familiarize students about the military as a profession, its expertise, and its proper role in society. And conversely show our sponsors in the Department of Defense and Intelligence community that civilian students can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and rapid prototyping of solutions to real-world problems.</p>

How is the way that universities teach entrepreneurship evolving? What changes have you seen in the last 15 years?</strong></p>
<p>Steve Blank: When I first starting teaching, the capstone entrepreneurship class was how to write a business plan. Other classes were on how to prep for VC pitches or develop the five year income statements, balance sheets and cash flows or read case studies. Today, people laugh if somebody says that&#8217;s a capstone entrepreneurship class. But years ago, we had no alternative – how to write a business plan was it.</p>
<p>My contribution has been, “Why don’t we design classes more closely modeled to what innovators and entrepreneurs actually do.” Today the capstone class is most often experiential, team-based, hands on, focused around the <i>search </i>for a repeatable and scalable business model. And the Lean LaunchPad class I developed at Stanford was the first such class. It was adopted by the National Science Foundation for commercializing science in the United States. It’s called <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF I-Corps</a>.</p>
<p>The other change is that universities, instead of being passive, have become active in building an entrepreneurial community. In addition to Stanford I also teach at Columbia, and at these research universities &#8211; Stanford, Columbia, Berkeley, and others &#8211; they all now have an internal incubator, they have maker spaces, they have their own venture funds, they connect to the community, they connect to venture capital. They&#8217;ve become outward-facing universities. It&#8217;s a big idea.</p>
<p>Years ago, entrepreneurship was taught like everything else, inward-facing, which was a mindset of, “I focus on what I know as an academic and I will teach you that,” which was mostly theory and/or consulting experience with large corporations. And the odds of learning from faculty who actually had experienced the chaos and uncertainty of building a startup was low. It wasn&#8217;t really part of the job as an educator. Today, if you&#8217;re building an entrepreneurship program, the teaching team most often includes adjuncts with entrepreneurial experience as complements to the tenured faculty, classes are experiential and the community you&#8217;re building is a set of additional components that never existed before.</p>
<p><strong>PB: In addition to being more outward facing, how should universities be thinking about what to offer next? What do you see in the next 2-3 years?</strong></p>
<p>SB: I think innovation and entrepreneurship will become the liberal arts of the 21st century. With the nature of work changing, the core skills entrepreneurs need to know to become practitioners are actually core skills that everybody will need to know to get a job: creativity, agility, resilience, tenacity, curiosity.</p>
<p>The analogy I like to use is that 500 years ago in the Renassiance we realized that the best way to teach artists, painters and sculptors, was by via hands-on apprenticeships and long-term commitment. You learned a modicum of theory and got a ton practice. (Today, if you&#8217;ve decided the arts are your career, your goal might be to get into Juilliard or CalArts.)</p>
<p>But about 100 years ago, in the art world, somebody had a lightbulb moment and said, &#8220;Wait a minute, in addition to the capstone classes, why don&#8217;t we teach art <em>appreciation</em> at the earliest possible age to <em>everyone</em>?&#8221; For example, finger-painting, making clay ashtrays and writing. The reason for that is two-fold. One is to have people self-identify at an early age that, &#8220;Oh, my gosh. Painting can be a career? I knew I was interested.&#8221; And second, so that the rest of us who are not going to be artists can appreciate how hard it is, and learn how to look at art and how to look at sculpture and how to appreciate good writing.</p>
<p>I believe the analogy is identical for entrepreneurship. The capstone entrepreneurship classes like NSF I-Corps or a Lean LaunchPad class, are for those who have already decided they want to be entrepreneurs. The part of the entrepreneurship curriculum that&#8217;s missing is offering <em>entrepreneurial appreciation</em> classes to <em>everyone</em>. We ought to be creating a set of classes on creativity, agility and resilience and being able to tell facts from &#8220;fake news&#8221; &#8212; components of innovation and entrepreneurship that I think are going to be required 21st century skills.</p>
<p><strong>PB: The trend is to add majors, minors and certificates in entrepreneurship. Not just in the business schools. For example, you can minor in entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado College of Music. In terms of teaching basic entrepreneurial appreciation, how saturated should entrepreneurship become? Is it one or two courses? Where do you see this trend going?</strong></p>
<p>SB: Teaching basic entrepreneurial appreciation in the 21st century is literally the equivalent to liberal arts of the 20th. Forward thinking schools will start offering a series of classes that are core curriculum like liberal arts were in schools in the &#8217;50s through the &#8217;80s that said “for a liberal arts education you need to understand literature and you need to understand art.” In the 21st century we&#8217;re going to add some additional core skills.</p>
<p>That said, entrepreneurship education needs to be a combination of theory <em>and </em>practice. It’s pretty easy to offer classroom entrepreneurship lectures and forget that it’s the hands-on application that makes the theory relevant. Think if medical schools just taught doctors the textbooks, but never had them touch a patient.</p>
<p>The other direction where teaching is going &#8211; and what we&#8217;ve been pioneering – is Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship. Instead of students or faculty coming in with their own ideas &#8212; we now have them working on societal problems, whether they&#8217;re problems for the State Department or the military or non-profits/NGOs, or for the City of Oakland or for energy or the environment, or for anything they&#8217;re passionate about. And the trick is we use the same Lean LaunchPad / I-Corps curriculum &#8212; and kept the same class structure &#8211; experiential, hands-on, driven this time by a <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>mission</em>-model</a> not a business model.</p>
<p>Mission-driven entrepreneurship is the answer to students who say, &#8220;I want to give back. I want to make my community, country or world a better place, while solving some of the toughest problems.&#8221; These classes include <a href="http://hacking4defense.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Defense</a>, <a href="http://hacking4diplomacy.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Diplomacy</a>, <a href="http://www.hacking4energy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Energy</a>, <a href="http://hacking4impact.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Impact</a>, or Hacking for Oceans, etc., but the umbrella term is “mission-driven entrepreneurship.” The class syllabus uses exactly the same pedagogy as the Lean LaunchPad and I-Corps classes.</p>
<p><strong>PB: How has your Lean LaunchPad course, ENGR 245, evolved?</strong></p>
<p>SB: I’ve always believed that great classes continue to thrive after the original teachers have moved on. To be honest, as I watch other instructors now run these classes, I feel a proud “passing of the torch” though touched by moments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King Lear</a> and Kurosawa’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ran</a>. Way past my ad hoc activities, <a href="https://steveblank.com/2019/03/26/the-lean-launchpad-class-its-the-same-but-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Stanford teaching team has thoroughly professionalized the class</a>.</p>
<p>After eight years the class is still taught to students working on their own problems. It&#8217;s taught at Stanford, Berkeley, Columbia and probably another hundred universities and colleges because I open-sourced the class and trained educators on how to teach it. 98 universities teach it through the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship classes are a new variant that&#8217;s taught in ~30 universities. The nice part is that we have educators who are already trained on teaching Lean LaunchPad or I-Corps, so for the educators there&#8217;s nothing particularly new. The only hard part about it, is to get well-defined problems from sponsors in the local city or government agency that you offer to students.</p>
<p><strong>PB: Everyone looks for a turnkey solution. &#8220;I want a low overhead, self-guided solution.&#8221; Can someone go through your Lean LaunchPad step-by-step course without a trainer? Can it be self-directed? How long does it take to train a trainer?</strong></p>
<p>SB: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-build-a-startup--ep245" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All my class lectures are online at Udacity.com</a> for free. Can you become a founder by watching videos? Perhaps, but founders are closer to artists than any other profession. So can you become an artist by reading about art? Can you learn entrepreneurship without taking an experiential hands-on class or better, actually be part of a startup? Well, you can read a lot about entrepreneurship and learn the theory, but it&#8217;s like reading about painting or sculpture or music. You need theory and practice – lots of practice.</p>
<p><strong>PB: Is ethics in entrepreneurship going to be part of the broader entrepreneurship curriculum like a general liberal arts education? Is ethics something that you bring into your Lean LaunchPad course or your ENGR 245 course?</strong></p>
<p>SB: I think ethics are a critical missing component of most business curriculums. At Stanford, <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/people/thomas-byers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Byers</a>, who runs the innovation and entrepreneurship program inside the engineering school, has made that a big deal and it&#8217;s now part of the curriculum. Tom has added <a href="https://ecorner.stanford.edu/article/finding-our-values-a-new-era-of-entrepreneurship-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a class on entrepreneurial ethics</a>.</p>
<p>However, the problem with teaching entrepreneurial ethics is the same as with teaching corporate ethics: Everything is great in theory until the sxxt hits the fan. When you don&#8217;t have any checks and balances, that is, when the government isn&#8217;t really paying attention or there are no consequences, you tend to get people who game the system, whether they&#8217;re corporations or they&#8217;re entrepreneurs and innovators.</p>
<p>It’s exactly like if you&#8217;ve ever been driving on a highway and reach a merge and people are cutting into the line and you go, &#8220;What the heck am I&#8217;m doing waiting for the merge while people are cutting in?&#8221; Then everybody else starts doing it and you think &#8220;Why am I the only person who&#8217;s patiently waiting?&#8221; There&#8217;s a social component about what&#8217;s the norm for behavior.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like we need a nanny-state, but if there&#8217;s no enforcement at all, we can teach ethics all we want, but people tend to devolve to the least common denominator.</p>
<p><strong>PB: How has innovation in large corporations evolved over the last 10 years? You talk about “innovation theater” in large corporations. What&#8217;s the trend in terms of corporations developing cultures of innovation and programs for intrapreneurs?</strong></p>
<p>SB: If you&#8217;re a large corporation, the world has turned upside down. In hindsight the 20th century was the golden age for corporations. Today, companies face five challenges they never had to deal with:</p>
<p>Challenge one &#8211; As companies are discovering every day, the web has changed everything. Distribution channels, brand loyalty, etc.</p>
<p>Challenge two &#8211; Large companies are dealing with startups that are funded with unimaginable capital. In the past, the idea of a startup having more capital than an existing corporation was a fantasy. But today if I&#8217;m a startup and I&#8217;m raising a hundred million dollars or billions of dollars, like Uber, Airbnb or Tesla, I can take on an entire industry.</p>
<p>Challenge three &#8211; Today, investors willingly fund startups to do anything on day one. Anything. Including break the law. Tesla, Airbnb, Uber, all were predicated on, &#8220;Well, what if we said, &#8216;screw the law&#8217;. How big would that opportunity be?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 20th century no venture capitalist would have funded that. In the 21st century they got out their little eyeshades and calculators and said, &#8220;Ha! If we actually succeed, there&#8217;s a $10 billion company here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, as much as a corporation wants to do that, the first thing that will happen is your general counsel&#8217;s in your office saying, &#8220;I want to see what you look like in a prison suit.&#8221; Because a company can&#8217;t do the things that a startup can.</p>
<p>Challenge four &#8211; In a startup, 100% of the company is focused on innovation and entrepreneurship. In a large corporation, 99% of the company is focused on <em>execution </em>of the current business model by building repeatable processes and procedures. And a very small percentage are focused on innovation. I could keep going on down the list.</p>
<p>Challenge five &#8211; In a startup, if you win, it&#8217;s a payout of billions of dollars. In a large company, for the individual, there is no such payout.</p>
<p><strong>PB: However, there are some companies that do evolve, that do pivot and make the right changes. What you&#8217;re talking about, &#8220;A large corporation is not a startup,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s going to go the way of the dodo. What are companies doing beyond innovation theater?</strong></p>
<p>SB: I just wanted to give you the setup of why it&#8217;s harder for corporations. Not why they can&#8217;t do it. In spite of all the things that I just mentioned, there are large companies that have figured out how to build innovation ecosystems. My favorite is a private company called <a href="https://www.gore.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W.L.Gore</a> &amp; Associates. At their core they make products out of expanded PTFE like GORE-TEX fabrics. But they’ve taken that basic technology past fabrics into multiple markets &#8211; medical, filtration, fibers, cables, etc. They have a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-gore-artificial-cornea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">process of continual innovation</a> – an <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-your-innovation-process-should-look-like">innovation pipeline</a>. But this type of innovation requires leadership who understands that is their goal. If you&#8217;re a large company&#8217;s CEO today, the problem is that you&#8217;re dealing with, well, lots of issues, not just innovation.</p>
<ul>
<li>One &#8211; &#8220;How do I deal with activist investors who want to take my company apart and sell it for pieces?&#8221;</li>
<li>Two &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been hearing about this innovation stuff, but if I&#8217;m running a 10,000-person company, my skill-set is about execution, not innovation. I might give you some head nods about innovation, but I really don&#8217;t have that in my DNA.&#8221;</li>
<li>Three &#8211; Companies are driven by processes and procedure, those same processes and procedures strangle innovation in its crib. For innovation to succeed inside of a large company, you need a parallel set of processes, not to replace the existing ones, but to operate on a fast track.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some companies have figured out how to do this, not just internally, but by just acquiring those that do. So, if you think about how a large company can innovate, they could build, they could buy, they could partner, they could license. All parts of their toolset where startups don&#8217;t have those opportunities. Basically, startups are just building.</p>
<p><strong>PB: Large corporations have a number of tools they use for innovation. One area is innovation challenges and idea challenges to come up with a thousand new ideas. A second option is for corporations to provide accelerators where they invite startups to apply to be part of their accelerator program. A third is incubators and makers&#8217; spaces. Do you see those as innovation programs that can work? They&#8217;re spending a lot of money on it.</strong></p>
<p>SB: No. What you just described is innovation <em>theater</em>. These are <a href="https://steveblank.com/2018/06/05/whats-next-for-getting-stuff-done-in-large-organizations-the-innovation-stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">innovation </a><a href="https://steveblank.com/2018/06/05/whats-next-for-getting-stuff-done-in-large-organizations-the-innovation-stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>activities</em></a>, not deliverables. The hard part in a company is not getting a demo or setting up an internal accelerator, it&#8217;s getting something delivered all the way through your existing sales channel. What does it take to get from that demo into your engineering group, to be delivered as a product into your existing sales channel? And that&#8217;s where the difficulties are. You run into, &#8220;Well, wait a minute, this isn&#8217;t on our budget or schedule.” “Wait a minute, this conflicts with our existing product line.” “This will put our most profitable product out of business,&#8221; or &#8220;We don&#8217;t even have a sales force that knows how to sell this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good number of companies focus on the easy part, which is, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have an incubator/accelerator.&#8221; The hard part is, “How do we deliver something with speed and urgency?” For example, when I teach this for the government, our focus is on innovation that gets deployed and fielded, not demos. (Yes, you might need a demo to convince someone to fund your program, but the demo is not the goal &#8211; delivery is.) Companies have more demos than they&#8217;ll ever need. But really the goal of a successful innovation program is figuring out how do you deploy something by getting through the hard political wiring diagram of who owns what, and how does this differ from what we already have, and which budget is it going to come from, and &#8220;this is unscheduled&#8221; and &#8220;wait a minute, it doesn&#8217;t meet our quality standards&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8217;re going to screw up our brand&#8221;?</p>
<p>How do we solve those problems? And that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not solvable. It just means the &#8220;Let&#8217;s throw a party&#8221; approach reminds me of the old Andy Hardy movies of &#8220;<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyLetsPutOnAShow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let&#8217;s put on a show</a>.&#8221; Ok, we&#8217;ve got a show, now what?</p>
<p>The &#8220;now what&#8221; is that we lack a <em>corporate innovation doctrine</em>.</p>
<p><strong>PB: I&#8217;m going to read a quote from you, which is &#8220;We believe the next big step is to get teams of leaders to think about the innovation process from end to end. That is, to visualize the entire flow of how and from where an idea is generated &#8211; the source &#8211; all the way to deployment &#8211; how to get it into the user&#8217;s hands.&#8221; You also have talked about an innovation stack and operational innovation, which is absent and so difficult to implement. What prompted these insights?</strong></p>
<p>SB: Here&#8217;s what I observed. Large companies and government agencies have always had innovation, but it&#8217;s what I call &#8220;heroic innovation.&#8221; That is, there was no process, no procedure, but you always hear stories about somebody who managed to get a new product or idea out the door. We tend to celebrate those without anybody ever thinking, &#8220;Well, wait a minute. Maybe the fact that there are no formal innovation processes is the problem, not that there was some heroic stuff happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last couple years, my work, Eric Ries&#8217;s work, Alexander Osterwalder&#8217;s work, all were focused on building a body of professional knowledge – <em>doctrine – </em>around innovation. And as part of that we’ve developed a set of tools that could be used to search for business models. Companies have adopted this innovation doctrine and startup tools and have been running accelerators and whatever. The problem is that there still wasn&#8217;t an end-to-end innovation implementation process, inside a large company.</p>
<p>What we came up with last year is called the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-your-innovation-process-should-look-like" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovation Pipeline</a>, a process inside a company or a government agency that says, &#8220;Let&#8217;s start with innovation sourcing. And then build a process to take that all the way to delivery or deployment. What are the steps internally we need to take that are different than how engineering builds products today?&#8221;</p>
<p>This end-to-end pipeline has a couple of steps. The first step is where the ideas or technology come from. They can come from inside the company, outside as acquisitions, universities, etc. The second step is, “What problem are we solving?” which we call problem curation. “Is this a real problem or is this a neat piece of flashy technology? How do we prioritize all the things we&#8217;re now doing inside this pipeline. And then how do we test solutions and hypotheses?”</p>
<p>In the middle of this pipeline is the I-Corps Lean LaunchPad methodology for customer discovery and validation. Next, how do we incubate it, and then how do we transition and integrate it with our existing engineering and sales organizations to deliver this stuff That&#8217;s an end-to-end process.</p>
<p>By contrast, an incubator and accelerator is a point <em>activity</em>.</p>
<p>As we’ve been teaching organizations this end-to-end Innovation Pipeline process we realized that at each one of those steps the team evolves. At the beginning of that pipeline you might have an innovator, a technologist in R&amp;D. That&#8217;s great, but we now know that either in startups or large companies innovators don&#8217;t make sxxt happen. They invent things.</p>
<p>Typically, to partner with the innovator on the first step, you need to find an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur inside of a company is somebody who knows how to get stuff across the finish line inside the bureaucracy. That&#8217;s very different than the innovator. The mistake that we tend to make is, &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s teach the innovators how to do that.&#8221; But innovators are almost never entrepreneurs. You can make them appreciate entrepreneurs, but they&#8217;re not the same people.</p>
<p><strong>PB: A trending challenge for directors of university entrepreneurship programs is to build an entrepreneurship ecosystem. These executive directors are struggling to decide, &#8220;What do I build out next? What program do I add next?&#8221; Is there some way to take your approach and to direct it to building university entrepreneurship ecosystems?</strong></p>
<p>SB: An example of what you just talked about is the <a href="https://techventures.columbia.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tech transfer and venture group at Columbia University</a>, run by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/orinherskowitz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orin Herskowitz</a>. Orin has spun seven different programs out of the Lean LaunchPad and Hacking for Defense programs. In energy and biotech and devices and whatever. Basically, using this pedagogy and building an entire ecosystem around it. It&#8217;s really impressive. Columbia’s tech transfer organization is a model of how universities may want to think about entrepreneurship ecosystems.</p>
<p>The other leading thinkers you should talk to are Tom Byers and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaseelig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tina Seelig</a> at Stanford. Stanford and Tom and Tina and <a href="https://stvp.stanford.edu/">their STVP program </a>are still ground zero for entrepreneurship programs in the world.</p>
<p>Also to watch is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-spinelli-2a6a295/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Spinelli</a> who just took over as Babson&#8217;s president. Between Spinelli, Orin, and Tom and Tina I think you&#8217;ll get an idea of the bleeding edge university entrepreneurship programs. If you want to talk to people who are inventing the future rather than talking about it, I would start with these three universities.</p>
<p><strong>PB: How can corporations work more closely with universities? How can they tap into student entrepreneurship talent for developing the kind of disruptive initiatives that corporations want? Instead of waiting until something happens. How can you create a pipeline with universities that are local or even virtually with universities?</strong></p>
<p>SB: For decades companies have been the primary acquirer of university research via tech transfer. And companies were the magnet for universities best and brightest students. No longer. In the 21st century companies are no longer competing for this tech and talent with their corporate peers, but with startups. To tap into university talent corporate innovation programs need to be more than an afterthought. Corporate leadership needs to make their internal commitment to innovation a beacon to the talent they desire.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern entrepreneurship began at the turn of this century with the observation that startups aren’t smaller versions of large companies – large companies at their core execute known business models, while startups search for scalable business models. <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lean Methodology</a> consists of three tools designed for entrepreneurs building new ventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Business-Model-Generation-Visionaries-Challengers/dp/0470876417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Model Canvas</a> – to write down all the hypotheses about a new business;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer Development</a> – a process for testing those hypotheses outside the building;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3237508/what-is-agile-methodology-modern-software-development-explained.html?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile Engineering</a> – to rapidly build minimal viable products to test product/market fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools tell you <em>how </em>to rapidly find product/market fit inside a market, and how to pivot when your hypotheses are incorrect. However, they don’t help you figure out <em>where </em><em>to start the search </em>for your new business.</p>
<p>A new tool &#8211; the Market Opportunity Navigator – helps do just that. It provides a wide-lens perspective to find different potential market domains for your innovation, before you zoom in and design the business model or test your minimal viable products. This new framework can act as<em> the front-end of Customer </em><i>Development. </i>It helps figure out the most promising starting position – market domain – for your customer development process. And it helps identify promising Plan B’s and new growth options if you have already embarked on your innovation journey.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have seen many startups and innovation projects perform a painful “re-start” to completely new market domains. With a little more thinking up front these entrepreneurs and innovators could have identified more promising business contexts to play in, and thus avoided this difficult pivot down the road. But while the academic literature is full of papers covering market selection and the literature has some popular books (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1625274491/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1625274491&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkId=3d7b2ea7b3bf5efb0dc801391253c696%22%3eBlue%20Ocean%20Strategy,%20Expanded%20Edition:%20How%20to%20Create%20Uncontested%20Market%20Space%20and%20Make%20the%20Competition%20Irrelevant%3c/a%3e%3cimg%20src=%22//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1625274491" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Ocean Strategy</a>, et al.) there is a lack of easy-to-use tools to do so.</p>
<p>In large companies and government agencies the problem is even more acute. Where do we spend our limited time and resources on our next moves? While <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-your-innovation-process-should-look-like" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Innovation Pipeline</a> tells us how to go to from sourcing to delivery how do we prioritize our choices? The Market Opportunity Navigator is a useful adjunct to the curation and prioritization steps.</p>
<p>Just like the <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas">Business Model Canvas</a>, the <a href="https://wheretoplay.co/navigator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Market Opportunity Navigator</a> has closed the gap between academic theory and books by offering a simple, visual way to navigate the process of how to select what market to start with. Developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcBGruber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Marc Gruber</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WhereToPlayCo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sharon Tal</a> and based on hundreds of cases they studied during their practical and academic work, the <a href="https://wheretoplay.co/navigator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Market Opportunity Navigator</a> is described in their new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1292178922/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1292178922&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkId=aa10ef28ec2feb2228593f7650d3cb60%22%3eWhere%20to%20Play:%203%20steps%20for%20discovering%20your%20most%20valuable%20market%20opportunities%3c/a%3e%3cimg%20src=%22//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1292178922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Where to Play</a>.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1292178922/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1292178922&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkId=aa10ef28ec2feb2228593f7650d3cb60%22%3eWhere%20to%20Play:%203%20steps%20for%20discovering%20your%20most%20valuable%20market%20opportunities%3c/a%3e%3cimg%20src=%22//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1292178922"><img data-attachment-id="25137" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2019/05/07/how-to-stop-playing-target-market-roulette-a-new-addition-to-the-lean-toolset/figure-1-1/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-1.1.png" data-orig-size="1775,2593" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Figure 1.1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-1.1.png?w=205" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-1.1.png?w=468" class="alignright wp-image-25137 size-thumbnail" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-1.1.png?w=103&#038;h=150" alt="" width="103" height="150" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-1.1.png?w=103&amp;h=150 103w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-1.1.png?w=206&amp;h=300 206w" sizes="(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px" /></a></p>
<p>In three simple steps the Market Opportunity Navigator can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify a portfolio of market opportunities stemming from your technology or unique abilities</li>
<li>Reveal the most attractive domain(s) by evaluating the potential and challenges of each option</li>
<li>Prioritize market opportunities smartly to set the boundaries for your lean experimentations</li>
</ul>
<p>I asked Sharon and Marc to summarize why market selection is important and describe an example of how to use it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Different Playgrounds mean different Rules of the Game<br />
</strong>There are many ways in which you may have identified a market for your business. Some of you may have identified a market need based on your own experience, or you may have been approached by potential customers, or if you are corporate innovator you may have applied an innovative solution to an existing target market. Yet, are you sure that this is the best opportunity? Could there be greener pastures (larger markets, more profitable markets, etc.) out there for commercializing your technology or unique abilities?</p>
<p>Taking the time to reveal the most promising market – the best starting position – before you engage in a focused customer development process is critical, because market domains vary in their value creation potential, competitive landscape, regulatory regime and risks associated with launching new products. In fact, by not asking “<em>Where to Play</em>” innovators risk choosing an inferior playground – one that does not allow the project to prosper. Beyond the possible loss of revenues, this early decision may be difficult to change, or even irreversible: it influences how you develop your technology going forward, raise money, write patents, recruit employees and pick a brand name. If re-start in another target market is required, such a pivot is painful, costly, and sometimes even impossible.</p>
<p>Finding the best starting position is a learning process that takes time and bandwidth &#8211; two scarce resources. So instead of taking a deliberate step back to understand their portfolio of opportunities, entrepreneurs and innovators often just start running. They make a bet and engage in customer development experiments &#8211; adopting “local” pivots in a relatively fixed context, until a scalable business model is (hopefully) revealed. This can be a <em>big </em>bet! The search for product/market fit and for a scalable, promising business model should therefore begin with uncovering and understanding the different market contexts in which you can play. In fact, by adopting a wider lens, the search process shifts from <em>2D </em>(finding a product-market fit) to <em>3D </em>(finding multiple product-market fits in different market contexts).</p>
<p>Academic research published in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Macmillan5/publication/37463914_Look_Before_You_Leap_Market_Opportunity_Identification_in_Emerging_Technology_Firms/links/02e7e5231c85d7b35a000000/Look-Before-You-Leap-Market-Opportunity-Identification-in-Emerging-Technology-Firms.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Management Science</a> investigated 85 VC-backed startups and offered a conclusion that seems obvious in hindsight: “look before you leap.” The big idea was that <em>experienced entrepreneurs tend to generate a portfolio of market opportunities before deciding where to play</em>, thereby laying the ground for significant performance benefits. In other words, understanding your arena of opportunities is a key asset for entrepreneurs and innovators.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying your Arena and Choosing Where to Play<br />
</strong>The <a href="http://www.wheretoplay.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Market Opportunity Navigator</a> provides a visual framework to discover, compare and prioritize different market domains and business contexts. It helps you to <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/06/transient-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">think about your arena, rather than your industry</a> &#8211; a key mindset shift in today&#8217;s competitive landscape.</p>
<p>The Navigator walks you through a three-step process that helps you to make a more informed choice. It does so in a friendly, intuitive manner, with a visual design board and 3 worksheets to guide the process.</p>

<p><strong>Putting it all together: A Superset of Tools<br />
</strong>Mapping out your market opportunities to understand your most promising starting position generates valuable insights for your innovation journey. In short, the big-picture view provided by the Navigator helps you zoom-out to understand “<em>where to play</em>,” while the detailed views of the lean approach and the <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Model</a> and <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Value Proposition Canvases</a> help you zoom-in and understand in detail “<em>how to play</em>.” Together, they create a superset of tools that supports you in an iterative learning process until you find a scalable, promising business.<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="25152" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2019/05/07/how-to-stop-playing-target-market-roulette-a-new-addition-to-the-lean-toolset/figure-3-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg" data-orig-size="1018,850" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Figure 3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=468" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25152" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=468&#038;h=391" alt="" width="468" height="391" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=468&amp;h=391 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=936&amp;h=782 936w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=125 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=250 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/figure-3-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=641 768w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p>Having a market opportunity portfolio to draw from offers an additional benefit. By having gamed out multiple markets, you can bake agility into the DNA of your venture &#8211; a key component in the Lean methodology. It allows you to carefully select and keep open backup and growth options.  If a “re-start” is eventually required, it will be less painful and less costly.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example from the startup world to see how the Market Opportunity Navigator works.</p>
<p><strong>We Can Fly Anywhere – but Where Do We Go First?<br />
</strong><a href="https://www.flyability.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flyability</a> develops drones to inspect difficult-to-access locations. In theory, they can custom-build their drone to perform different jobs in completely different markets: industrial inspection, search and rescue, entertainment or surveillance &#8211; to name but a few. Each of these markets varies significantly in its business context and in its promise for growth. Furthermore, each market would require its own customer development process to reveal a scalable, repeatable business model &#8211; clearly a demanding process that is difficult to run simultaneously in multiple domains.</p>
<p>So how did Flyability find <em>its best starting position </em>– the initial market domain where the founders should engage in detailed customer discovery and build their business? They used the Navigator and its three worksheets to guide their process.</p>
<p><strong>Worksheet 1: Generate your market opportunity set</strong><u><br />
<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="25165" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/worksheets-navigators-navigator-4/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg" data-orig-size="3509,2481" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;worksheets-navigator&#039;s-navigator&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="worksheets-navigator&#8217;s-navigator" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=468" class="aligncenter wp-image-25165 size-large" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=468&#038;h=331" alt="" width="468" height="331" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=468&amp;h=331 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=936&amp;h=662 936w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=106 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=212 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/flyability-w1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=543 768w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></u>The founders’ first idea was to use the drone for observing critical disasters, like the reactor meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan. Yet, by going through the first step of the Navigator, the team began to uncover alternative markets where their drone could add value for customers. Among others, they considered drone-based inspection of boilers in thermal power plants, the inspection of oil &amp; gas storage tanks, and intelligence-gathering by police forces. Overall, five market domains seemed interesting and required further evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Worksheet 2: Evaluate market opportunity attractiveness</strong><u><br />

This allowed Flyability to map out their options and visually compare their attractiveness. Gradually, it became clear that thermal power plants were a “gold mine” option worth playing in. They could now use the Business Model Canvas and the lean experimentation processes to design and validate a scalable business model within this market.</p>
<p><strong>Worksheet 3: Design your agile focus strategy<br />

Specifically, using the third step of the Navigator, the founders designed a small portfolio of backup and growth options that they would keep open. This foresight laid the ground to early key decisions that have long-term consequences, like how they developed their drone or chose their brand name. In addition, it helped them clearly define which options they would place in storage for now (as <a href="https://medium.com/@donhopkins/focusing-is-about-saying-no-steve-jobs-wwdc-97-ff0174c171d0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focusing is about saying no</a> more than anything else).</p>

<p><strong>Insights for VCs, Tech Transfer Officers, and Social Entrepreneurs<br />
</strong>Identifying your arena of opportunities is not only key for startups and established firms, but for anyone dealing with technology commercialization. For VC&#8217;s, the macro-level perspective shows the market opportunities that can be addressed by a startup and lays out a clear monetization process over time. It also offers a portfolio perspective when screening initial or successive investments. If you are working for a Tech Transfer Office, a wide-lens perspective is essential for assessing the value of an invention, and for figuring out in which hands you should put it. Furthermore, if you are trying to address a social problem, the Navigator helps ensure you identify a market that allows you to generate an economic bottom-line in addition to your social impact.</p>

<p>VC&#8217;s have just changed the ~50-year old social contract with startup employees. In doing so they may have removed one of the key incentives that made startups different from working in a large company.</p>
<p>For most startup employee’s <em>startup stock options are now a bad deal</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s why.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Why Startups Offer Stock Options<br />
</strong>In tech startups stock options were here almost from the beginning, <a href="http://www.financialpolicy.org/dscprimerstockoption2a.htm">first offered to the founders in 1957 at Fairchild Semiconductor</a>, the first chip startup in Silicon Valley. As Venture Capital emerged as an industry in the mid 1970’s, investors in venture-funded startups began to give stock options to <em>all </em>their employees. On its surface this was a pretty radical idea. The investors were giving away part of their ownership of the company &#8212; not just to the founders, but to all employees. Why would they do that?</p>
<p>Stock options for all employees of startups served several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because startups didn’t have much cash and couldn’t compete with large companies in salary offers, stock options dangled in front of a potential employee were like offering a lottery ticket in exchange for a lower salary. Startup employees calculated that a) their hard work could change the odds and b) someday the stock options they were vesting might make them into millionaires.</li>
<li>Investors bet that by offering prospective hires a stake in the company&#8217;s future growth- <em>with a visible time horizon of a payoff </em>&#8211; employees would act more like owners and work harder&#8211; and that would align employee interests with the investor interests. And the bet worked. It drove the relentless “do whatever it takes” culture of 20<sup>th </sup>century Silicon Valley. We slept under the tables, and pulled all-nighters to get to first customer ship, man the booths at trade shows or ship products to make quarterly revenue – all because it was “our” company.</li>
<li>While founders had more stock than the other employees, they had the same type of stock options as the rest of the employees, and they only made money when everyone else did (though a lot more of it.) Back then, when Angel/Seed investing didn’t exist, to get the company started, founders put a lot more on the line – going without a salary, mortgaging their homes etc. This “we’re all in it together” kept founders and employees aligned on incentives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanics of a stock option was a simple idea – you received an option (an offer) to buy a part of the company via <em>common </em>stock options (called <a href="http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/03/05/whats-the-difference-between-an-iso-and-an-nso/">ISOs or NSOs</a>) at a low price (the “strike price”.) If the company was successful, you could sell it at a much higher price when the company went public (when its shares were listed on a stock exchange and could be freely traded) or was acquired.</p>
<p>You didn’t get to own your stock options all at once. The stock trickled out over four years, as you would “vest” 1/48<sup>th </sup>of the option each month. And just to make sure you were in the company for at least a year, with most stock option plans, unless you stayed an entire year, you wouldn’t vest any stock.</p>

The founders got most of the <em>common </em>stock. Early employees got a smaller percentage, and later employees received even a smaller piece – fractions of a percent – versus the double digits the founders owned.</p>
<p>In the 20<sup>th </sup>century, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00661.pdf">the best companies IPO’d in 6-8 years from startup</a> (and in the Dot-Com bubble of 1996-1999 that could be as short as 2-3 years.) Of the four startups I was in that went public, it took as long as six years and as short as three.</p>
<p>One other thing to note is that all employees – founders, early employees and later ones – all had the same vesting deal &#8211; four years &#8211; and <em>no one made money on stock options until a “liquidity event</em>” (a fancy word to mean when the company went public or got sold.) The rationale was that since there was no way for investors to make money until then, neither should anyone else.  Everyone—investors, founders and startup employees—was, so to speak, in the same boat.</p>
<p><strong>Startup Compensation Changes with Growth Capital &#8211; 12 Years to an IPO<br />
</strong>Much has changed about the economics of startups in the two decades. And <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marksuster">Mark Suster</a> of <a href="https://upfront.com/">Upfront Capital</a> has a great <a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/a-deep-dive-into-what-has-really-changed-in-venture-capital-f5d225f7f8">post</a> that summarizes these changes.</p>
<p>The first big idea is that unlike in the 20<sup>th </sup>century when there were two phases of funding startups&#8211;<em>Seed </em>capital and <em>Venture </em>capital&#8211;today there is a new, third phase. It&#8217;s called <em>Growth </em>capital.</p>

<p>Suster points out that <em>the longer the company stays private, the more valuable it becomes</em>. And if during this time VC’s can hold onto their pro-rata (fancy word for what percentage of the startup they own), they can make a ton more money.</p>
<p>The premise of Growth capital is that if that by staying private longer, all the growth upside that went to the public markets (Wall Street) could instead be made by the private investors (the VC’s and Growth Investors.)</p>
<p>The three examples Suster uses &#8211; Salesforce, Google and Amazon &#8211; show how much more valuable the companies were <em>after </em>their IPOs. Before these three went public, they weren’t unicorns – that is their market cap was less than a billion dollars. Twelve years later, Salesforce’s market cap was $18 billion, Google’s was $162 billion, and Amazon’s was $17 billion.<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="25052" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2019/04/10/startup-stock-options-why-a-good-deal-has-gone-bad/growth-appreciation/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg" data-orig-size="1854,891" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="growth appreciation" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=468" class="aligncenter wp-image-25052 size-large" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=468&#038;h=225" alt="" width="468" height="225" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=468&amp;h=225 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=936&amp;h=450 936w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=150&amp;h=72 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=300&amp;h=144 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/growth-appreciation.jpg?w=768&amp;h=369 768w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a>To Suster’s point, it isn’t that startups today can’t raise money by going public, it’s that their <em>investors can make </em><em>more money by keeping them private and going public later </em>– now 10-12 years<em>. </em>And currently there is an influx of capital to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Founders Rule<br />
</strong>The emergence of Growth capital, and pushing an IPO out a decade or more, has led to a <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/11/when-founders-go-too-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatic shift in the balance of power</a> between founders and investors. For three decades, from the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, the rules of the game were that a company must become profitable and hire a professional CEO before an IPO.</p>
<p>That made sense. Twentieth-century companies, competing in slower-moving markets, could thrive for long periods on a single innovation. If the VCs threw out the founder, the professional CEO who stepped in could grow a company without creating something new. In that environment, replacing a founder was the rational decision. But 21st century companies face compressed technology cycles, which create the need for continuous innovation over a longer period of time. Who leads that process best? Often it is founders, whose creativity, comfort with disorder, and risk-taking are more valuable at a time when companies need to retain a startup culture even as they grow large.</p>
<p>With the observation that founders added value during the long runup in the growth stage, VCs began to cede compensation and <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/11/when-founders-go-too-far">board control</a> to founders. (See the HBR story <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/11/when-founders-go-too-far">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Startup Stock Options &#8211; Why A Good Deal Has Gone Bad<br />
</strong>While founders in the 20<sup>th </sup>century had more stock than the rest of their employees, they had <em>the same type </em>of stock options. <em>Today, that’s not true</em>. Rather, when a startup first forms, the founders grant themselves <em>Restricted Stock Awards </em>(RSA) instead of common stock options. Essentially the company sells them the stock at zero cost, and they <a href="https://500.co/founder-equity-101/">reverse vest.</a></p>

<p>Early employees take an equal risk that the company will crater, and they often work equally as hard.  However, today founders own 30-50 times more than a startup’s early employees. (What has happened in founder compensation and board control has mirrored the growth in corporate CEO compensation. In the last 50 years, corporate CEO pay went from 20 times an average employee to over 300 times their compensation.)</p>
<p>On top of the founder/early employee stock disparity, <em>the VC’s have moved the liquidity goal posts but haven’t moved the vesting goal posts </em>for non-founders. Consider that the <a href="https://carta.com/blog/employment-tenure-startups/">median tenure in a startup is 2 years</a>. By year three, 50% of the employees will be gone. If you’re an early employee, today <em>the company may not go public until eight years after you vest</em>.</p>
<p>So why should non-founding employees of startups care? You’ll still own your stock, and you can leave and join another startup. There are four problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, as the company raises more money, the value of your initial stock option grant gets diluted by the new money in. (VC’s typically have pro-rata rights to keep their percentage of ownership intact, but employees don’t.) So while the VCs gain the upside from keeping a startup private, employees get the downside.</li>
<li>Second, when IPO’s no longer happen within the near time horizon of an employee’s tenure, the original rationale of stock options &#8211; offering prospective hires a stake in the company&#8217;s future growth with a visible time horizon of a payoff for their hard work – has disappeared. Now there’s <em>little financial reason to stay longer than the initial grant vesting.</em></li>
<li>Third, as the fair market value of the stock rises (to what the growth investors are paying), the high exercise price isn’t attractive for hiring new employees especially if they are concerned about having to <a href="https://employeestockoptions.com/exercise-loan/">leave and pay the high exercise price</a> in order to keep the shares.</li>
<li>And finally, in many high valued startups where there are hungry investors, the founders get to sell parts of their vested shares at each round of funding. (At times this opportunity is offered to all employees in a “secondary” offering.) A “secondary” usually (though not always) <a href="https://medium.com/@rizstanford/secondary-sales-in-vc-backed-startups-a-quick-primer-for-entrepreneurs-bdc25ea7f39a">happens when the startup has achieved significant revenue or traction</a> and is seen as a “leader” in their market space, on the way to an IPO or a major sale</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The End of the High-Commitment/High-Performance Work System?<br />
</strong>In the academic literature, the work environment of a startup is called a <a href="https://nscpolteksby.ac.id/ebook/files/Ebook/Business%20Administration/ARMSTRONGS%20HANDBOOK%20OF%20HUMAN%20RESOURCE%20MANAGEMENT%20PRACTICE/13%20-%20High-perfomance%20Work%20Systems.pdf">high-commitment/ high-performance work system</a>. This is <a href="https://libjournals.mtsu.edu/index.php/jsbs/article/view/611/658">a bundle of Human Resources startup practices</a> that include hiring, self-managing teams, rapid and decentralized decision-making, on-boarding, flexible work assignments, communication, <em>and stock options</em>. And there is evidence that <a href="https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1098&amp;context=workingpapers">stock options increase the success of startups</a>.</p>
<p>Successful startups need highly committed employees who believe in the goals and values of the company. In exchange for sharing in the potential upside—and being valued as a critical part of the team, they’re willing to rise to the expectation of putting work and the company in front of everything else. But this level of commitment depends on whether <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/140215.pdf">employees perceive these practices to be fair</a>, both in terms of the process and the outcomes.</p>
<p>VCs have intentionally changed the ~50-year-old social contract with startup employees. At the same time, <em>they may have removed one of the key incentives that made startups different from working in a large company</em>.</p>
<p>While unique technology or market insight is one component of a successful startup everyone agrees that attracting <u>and retaining</u> A+ talent differentiates the winners from the losers. In trying to keep companies private longer, but not pass any of that new value to the employees, the VC’s may have killed the golden goose.</p>
<p><strong>What Should Employees Do?<br />
</strong>In the past the founders and employees were aligned with the same type of common stock grant, and it was the VCs who got preferential stock treatment. Today, if you’re an employee you’re now are at the bottom of the stock preference pile. The founders have preferential stock treatment and the VC have preferred stock. And you’re working just as hard. Add to that all the other known negatives of a startups– no work-life balance, insane hours, inexperienced management, risk of going out of business, etc.</p>
<p>That said, joining a startup still has a lot of benefits for employees who are looking to work with high performance teams with little structure. Your impact likely be felt. Constant learning opportunities, responsibility and advancement are there for those who take it.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the early senior hires, there’s no downside of asking for the same Restricted Stock Agreements (RSAs) as the founders. And if you’re joining a larger startup, you may want to consider those who are offering restricted stock units (RSUs) rather than common stock.</p>
<p><strong>What Should Investors Do?<br />
</strong>One possibility is to replace early employee (first ~10 employees) stock options with the same Restricted Stock Agreements (RSAs) as the founders.</p>
<p>For later employees make sure the company offers “refresh” option grants to longer-tenured employees. Better yet, offer restricted stock units (RSUs). Restricted Stock Units are a company’s promise to give you shares of the company’s stock. Unlike a stock option, which always has a strike (purchase) price higher than $0, an RSU is an option with a $0 purchase price. The lower the strike price, the less you have to pay to own a share of company stock<em>. </em>Like stock options, RSU’s vest.</p>
<p>But to keep employees engaged, they ought to be allowed buy their vested RSU stock and sell it every time the company raises a new round of funding.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Venture Capital structures were set up for a world in which successful companies exited in 6-8 years and didn&#8217;t raise too much capital</li>
<li>Venture capital growth funds are now giving startups the cash they would have received at an IPO
<ul>
<li>“Growth Capital” moved the need for an IPO out another five years</li>
<li>This allows VCs to capture the increase in market cap in the company</li>
<li>It may have removed the incentive for non-founders to want to work in a startup versus a large company</li>
<li>As stock options with four-year vesting are no longer a good deal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Investors and Founders have changed the model to their advantage, but no one has changed the model for early employees
<ul>
<li>VCs need to consider a new stock incentive model – RSA’s for the first key hires and then RSU’s – Restricted Stock Units for everyone else</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Large companies now have an opportunity to attract some of the talent that previously went elsewhere</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>It’s the same, but different</em></p>
<p>We just finished the 8<sup>th </sup>annual Lean LaunchPad class at Stanford. The team presentations are at the end of this post.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine, but only a decade ago, the capstone entrepreneurship class in most universities was how to write – or pitch- a business plan. As a serial entrepreneur turned educator, this didn’t make sense to me. In my experience, I saw that <em>most business plans don’t survive first contact with customers</em>.</p>
<p>So in 2011, with support from the <a href="https://stvp.stanford.edu/">Stanford Technology Ventures Program</a> (the entrepreneurship center in the Stanford Engineering School), we created a new capstone entrepreneurship class – the <a href="http://stanfordleanlaunchpad.weebly.com/details.html">Lean LaunchPad</a>. The class was unique in that it was 1) team-based, 2) experiential, 3) lean-driven (hypothesis testing/business model/customer development/agile engineering). This new class aimed to mimic the uncertainty all startups face as they search for a business model while imparting an understanding of <em>all </em>the components of a business model, not just how to give a pitch or a demo.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s worth reading the blog post that became the manifesto of the class <a href="https://steveblank.com/2011/03/08/a-new-way-to-teach-entrepreneurship-the-lean-launchpad-at-stanford-class-1/">here</a> as well as what we learned when we first taught it- <a href="https://steveblank.com/2011/05/10/the-lean-launchpad-at-stanford-%E2%80%93-the-final-presentations/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Ninety days after we first offered this class at Stanford, the National Science Foundation adopted the class calling it the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/">I-Corps</a> (the Innovation Corps) to train our country’s top scientists how to commercialize their inventions. I-Corps is now offered in 88 universities. The National Institute of Health teaches its version in the National Cancer Institute. (<a href="https://sbir.cancer.gov/programseducation/icorps">I-Corps @ NIH</a>). (The NIST <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1234.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report on Unleashing Innovation</a> recommended expanding I-Corps and the House just passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act</a> to do just that.) The Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps syllabus is the basis for a series of Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship classes; Hacking for <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/12/12/hacking-for-diplomacy-stanford-what-we-learned-with-the-state-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diplomacy</a>, <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/06/03/hacking-for-defense-stanford-lessons-learned-presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defense</a>, <a href="http://www.hacking4energy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy</a>, Oceans, <a href="http://hacking4impact.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-profits</a> and cities.</p>
<p>If you had dropped by in 2011, the first time I taught the class, and then stuck your head in today, you’d say it was the same class. The syllabus is almost identical, the teams still get out of the building to do customer discovery every week, then come back to class and present what they learned weekly, etc.</p>
<p>But while it’s the same, it’s different.</p>
<p>After thousands of students taking this class, here are a few ways the class has changed.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>A Great Class Endures Beyond Its Author<br />
</strong>I’ve always believed that great classes continue to thrive after the original teachers have moved on. While I created the Lean LaunchPad methodology and pedagogy (how to teach the class) and the train-the-trainer course for the NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/">I-Corps</a>, the sheer scale and success of the class is due to the efforts of the 100’s of National Science Foundation instructors and the NSF. And while I created the original course, the Stanford class is now led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffepstein1/">Jeff Epstein</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sweinstein/">Steve Weinstein</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest, as I watch other instructors now run these classes, I feel a proud “passing of the torch” though touched by moments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear">King Lear</a> and Kurosawa’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ran_(film)">Ran</a>. Way past my ad hoc activities, the Stanford teaching team has thoroughly professionalized the class.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded Teaching Team<br />
</strong>In addition to the lead instructors, the Stanford teaching team now includes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghjohn/">George John</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mar-hershenson-b21395/">Mar Hershenson</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bedecarre/">Tom Bedecarre</a>, all generously volunteering their time. Each of them brings decades of industry experience to the class. This type of teaching firepower and headcount was necessary as the teaching team expanded the class size to meet student demand.</p>
<p><strong>Class Size<br />
</strong>For the first few National Science Foundation classes, we taught 24 teams at a time with three instructors. We did it by breaking the class into three separate sections, having all teams together for our lectures and separating into sections of eight teams each when the teams presented. (After painful trial and error, we had discovered that the teaching team could listen to 8 teams present before our brains melted down.)</p>
<p>At Stanford we limited the class to 8 teams &#8211; four students per team. However, this year, the class was so oversubscribed, and the quality of the teams applying was so high, the teaching team admitted 14 teams and reverted to the original NSF model of separating into sections. The additional teaching team members made it possible.</p>
<p><strong>Class Velocity/Depth<br />
</strong>When we started this class, the concept of Lean (business models, customer development, agile, pivots, mvp&#8217;s) was new to everyone. Now they&#8217;re common buzzwords, and most of the students come in with an understanding of Lean. This head start has allowed the teaching team to accelerate the velocity and depth of learnings past the basics.</p>
<p><strong>Women<br />
</strong>In past years, the student teams in the Stanford classes were weighted toward men, reflecting the makeup of the applicants. While <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amiura/">Ann Miura-Ko</a> was part of the original teaching team, having all male instructors for the last five years didn’t help. After <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mar-hershenson-b21395/">Mar Hershenson</a> joined the teaching team last year, she made an all-out effort to recruit women to apply. A role model as a successful CEO and VC, Mar successfully sparked interest in women students and sponsored women-only lunch sessions, mixers and meetings to introduce them to the class. As you’ll notice from the presentations below, the result was that this year 50% of the applicants and accepted teams were women.</p>
<p>The lessons for me were: 1) the class had been unintentionally signaling a “boys-only” environment, 2) these unconscious biases were easily dismissed by assuming that the class makeup simply reflected the applicant pipeline, and 3) when in fact it required active outreach by a woman to change that perception and bring more women into the pipeline and subsequent teams.</p>
<p><strong>Product/Market Fit Versus The Business Model Canvas<br />
</strong>My original vision for the class was to use the business model canvas as a framework to teach <em>engineering </em>students <em>all the nine elements of the business model: </em>customer, distribution channel, revenue, get/keep/grow, value proposition, activities, resources, partners and costs. And instead of the traditional income statement, balance sheet and cash flow, discover the key “metrics that matter” for their business model.</p>
<p>While students want to spend their time focusing on product/market fit (who’s the customer and what should we build for them) and building product-centric minimum viable products, I thought that Y-Combinator and other accelerators already did an excellent job of that. My goal was to use the canvas to expose <em>engineering </em>students to other essential aspects of a successful business they may be less familiar with (sales, marketing, finance, operations.)</p>
<p>Admittedly this was tough to do, because in one quarter teams haven’t yet found product/market fit and are loath to move off it until they do. But since my goal was to teach a methodology rather than to run an accelerator, I traded off time on product/market fit for exposure to the rest of the canvas.</p>
<p>If we were designing a curriculum rather than just a single class, we&#8217;d offer it as two semesters/quarters &#8211; the first searching for problem/solution and product/market fit, and the second half focusing on the rest of the canvas testing feasibility and viability.</p>
<p>As you look at this year’s presentations, you can see the presentations still tend to focus on product/market fit. Obviously, there is no right answer to what and how to teach, and the answer may change over time.</p>
<p><strong>TAs/ Diagnostics/Mentors<br />
</strong>Our Teaching Assistants keep all the moving parts of the class running. Each years TAs have continued to make the class better (although I must admit it was interesting to watch the TAs remove any uncertainty from what students need to do week-to-week, as I had designed a level of uncertainty into the class to mimic what a real-world startup would feel like.) The teaching team and TA’s have added an enormous number of useful diagnostics to measure student reactions to each part of the pedagogy and the overall value of the class. However, the real art of teaching is to remember that the class wasn’t designed by a focus group.</p>
<p>Finally, the mentors (unpaid industry advisors) who volunteer their time have been professionalized and managed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bedecarre/">Tom Bedecarre</a>. Each mentor’s contribution gets graded by the students in the team they coached.</p>
<p><strong>Things That Needed Constant Reminders<br />
</strong>Every time we slipped up and admitted an all engineering or all MBA team we were reminded by their struggles that successful teams need to be diverse &#8211; that they include both innovators and entrepreneurs (typically engineers and MBA&#8217;s.)</p>
<p>The same holds true for pushing the students. Every time we slacked off relentlessly direct feedback we saw a commensurate drop in the quality of the teams output.</p>
<p><strong>The Teams<br />
</strong>In the end, this class is not only about what the instructors try to teach the students but also about whether students processed what we intended for them to learn. Over time, two of our major insights were: 1) teams needed a week to process all they learned, and 2) we needed to teach them how to turn that learning into a story of their journey.</p>
<p>This year all our teams accomplished that and much, much more.</p>
<p>And after 9 years of classes, students still find that this class is the closest thing to being in a real startup.</p>

<p>If you’re an early employee at a startup, one day you will wake up to find that what you worked on 24/7 for the last year is no longer the most important thing – you’re no longer the most important employee, and process, meetings, paperwork and managers and bosses have shown up. Most painfully, you’ll learn that <a href="https://steveblank.com/2015/02/12/what-do-i-do-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your role in the company has to change</a>.</p>
<p>I blogged about this earlier <a href="https://steveblank.com/2018/11/13/its-not-change-you-fear-its-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and got the chance to talk about the topic at the Startup Grind conference.</p>
<p>Below is a video of the talk.</p>

</div>
<div>1:40: Having The Talk: How I lost my job after helping the company succeed<br />
5:30: You need different skills as your company grows<br />
6:47: A visceral blow: What just happened?<br />
8:02: How I blew an opportunity<br />
9:55: What you&#8217;ll feel if this happens to you<br />
15:40: Why there should be no job titles at your startup<br />
18:00: Why founders often come from dysfunctional families &#8212; and what that means for them as a company transitions<br />
22:39: If you can see your future, you can change your future</div>

<p>I’m a big fan of <u><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/enduring-ideas-the-three-horizons-of-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McKinsey’s Three Horizons Model</a> </u>of innovation. (if you’re not familiar with it there’s a brief description a few paragraphs down.) It’s one of the quickest ways to describe and prioritize innovation ideas in a large company or government agency.</p>
<p>However, in the 21<sup>st</sup>century the Three Horizons model has a fatal flaw that could put companies out of business and government agencies behind their adversaries. While traditional analysis suggests that Horizon 3 disruptive innovations take years to develop, in today’s world <em>this is no longer the case</em>. The three horizons are not bound by time. <em>Horizon 3 ideas – disruption &#8211; can be delivered as fast as ideas for Horizon 1 – existing products</em>.</p>
<p>In order to not be left behind, companies / government agencies need to focus on speed of delivery and deployment across all three horizons.</p>
<hr />
<p>When first articulated by <u><a href="http://www.alchemygrowth.com/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baghai</a></u>, Coley and White in the 20<sup>th </sup>century, the Three Horizons model was a simple way to explain to senior management the need for an <a href="https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ambidextrous organization</a> &#8211; the idea that companies and government agencies need to <em>execute </em>existing business / mission models while <em>simultaneously creating new capabilities. </em></p>
<p>The Three Horizons provided an incredibly useful taxonomy. The model described innovation occurring in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0738203092/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0738203092&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkId=6DL2L3MYML7GXVNH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three time horizons</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizon 1 ideas provide continuous innovation to a company’s existing business model and core capabilities.</li>
<li>Horizon 2 ideas extend a company’s existing business/model and core capabilities to new customers, markets or targets.</li>
<li>Horizon 3 is the creation of new capabilities to take advantage of or respond to disruptive opportunities or to counter disruption.</li>
</ul>

McKinsey suggested that to remain competitive in the long run a company allocate its research and development dollars and resources across all three horizons.</p>
<p>And here’s the big idea. In the past we assigned relative <em>delivery time </em>to each of the Horizons. For example, some organizations defined Horizon 1 as new features that could be delivered in 3-12 months; Horizon 2 as business/mission model extensions 24-36 months out; and Horizon 3 as creating new disruptive products/business/mission models 36-72 months out.  This time-based definition made sense in the 20<sup>th </sup>century when new disruptive ideas took years to research, engineer and deliver.</p>
<p>That’s no longer true in the 21<sup>st </sup>century.</p>
<p>Today, <em>disruption <strong>– </strong>Horizon 3 ideas – can be delivered as fast as Horizon 1 ideas.</em></p>
<p>For example, Uber took existing technology (smartphone app, drivers) but built a unique business model (<a href="https://www.gigeconomydata.org/basics/what-gig-worker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gig economy</a> disrupting taxis) and the Russians used existing social media tools to wage political warfare. Fast disruption happens by building on existing technologies uniquely configured, packaged and/or delivered, and combining them with a “speed of good-enough deployment as a force multiplier” mindset.</p>
<p><strong>What’s an Example of Rapid Horizon 3 Implementation?<br />
</strong>In the commercial space AirBnB, Uber, Craigslist, Tesla, and the explosion of machine learning solutions (built on hardware originally designed for computer graphics (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nvida</a>)) are examples of radical disruption using existing technologies in extremely short periods of time.</p>
<p>In the government space, Russian interference with elections, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/world/asia/south-china-seas-photos.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">China building island bases in the South China Sea</a> as well as repurposing <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-new-carrier-killer-missile-could-mean-big-trouble-the-24284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICBMs as conventional weapons</a> to attack aircraft carriers, are examples of radical disruption using existing technologies deployed in extremely short periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Different about Rapid Horizon 3 Disruption?<br />
</strong>These rapid Horizon 3 deliverables emphasize disruption, asymmetry and most importantly <em>speed</em>, over any other characteristic. Serviceability, maintainability, completeness, scale, etc. are all secondary to speed and asymmetry.</p>
<p>To existing competitors or to existing requirements and acquisition systems they look like minimum viable products &#8211; barely finished, iterative and incremental prototypes. But the new products get out of the building, disrupt incumbents and once established, they then <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/refactoring/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'refactoring))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refactor</a> and scale. Incumbents now face a new competitor/threat that obsoletes their existing product line/infrastructure/business/mission model.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do the Challengers/new Entrants Have the Edge?<br />
</strong>Ironically rapid Horizon 3 disruption is most often used not by the market leaders but by the challengers/new entrants (startups, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/08/world/isis-fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISIS</a>, China, Russia, etc.). The new players have no legacy systems to maintain, no cumbersome requirements and acquisition processes, and are single-mindedly focused on disrupting the incumbents.</p>
<p><strong>Four Strategies to Deal With Disruption<br />
</strong>For incumbents, there are four ways to counter rapid disruption:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Incentivize external resources </em>to focus on your goal/mission. For example, NASA and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/launch/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Commercial Resupply Services</a> with SpaceX and OrbitalATK, Apple and the App Store, <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/public/prizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DARPA Prize challenges</a>. The large organizations used startups who could rapidly build and deliver products for them – by offering something the startups needed – contracts, a distribution platform, or prizes. This can be a contract with a single startup or a broader net to incentivize many.</li>
<li>Combine the existing strengths of a company/agency and its business/mission model by <em>acquiring external innovators </em>who can operate at the speed of the disruptors. For example, Google buying Android. The risk here is that the mismatch of culture, process and incentives may strangle the newly acquired innovation culture.</li>
<li><em>Rapidly copy </em>the new disruptive innovators and use the incumbent’s business/mission model to dominate. For example, Microsoft copying Netscape’s web browser and using its dominance of operating system distribution to win, or Google copying Overture’s pay per click model and using its existing dominance in search to sell ads. The risk here is that copying innovation without understanding the customer problem/mission can result in solutions that miss the target.</li>
<li><em>Innovate better than the disrupters</em>. (Extremely difficult for large companies/government agencies as it is as much a culture/process problem as a technology problem. Startups are born betting it all. Large organizations are executing and protecting the legacy.) Successful examples, Apple and the iPhone, Amazon and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. Gov’t agency and <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol.-57-no.-1-a/vol.-57-no.-1-a-pdfs/Strickland-Evolution%20of%20the%20Predator.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">armed drones</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Three Horizons model is still very useful as a shorthand for prioritizing innovation initiatives.</li>
<li>Some Horizon 3 disruptions do take long periods of development</li>
<li>However, today many Horizon 3 disruptions can be rapidly implemented by repurposing existing Horizon 1 technologies into new business/mission models</li>
<li>Speed of deployment of a disruptive/asymmetric product is a force multiplier</li>
<li>The attackers have the advantage, as the incumbents are burdened with legacy</li>
<li>Four ways for the incumbents to counter rapid disruption:
<ul>
<li><em>Incentivize external resources</em></li>
<li><em>Acquire external innovators </em></li>
<li><em>Rapidly copy</em></li>
<li><em>Innovate better than the disrupters</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

But it&#8217;s been awhile since I was in a room made up entirely of Life Science entrepreneurs. So I was excited to visit <a href="https://indiebio.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieBio, </a>a life science accelerator in San Francisco. Think of <a href="https://indiebio.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieBio</a> as &#8220;Y-Combinator for Life Sciences with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wet lab</a>&#8221; and you get what they are trying to do. It&#8217;s a 4-month program to help biotech startups build their company and it comes with $250k in seed funding.</p>
<p>I sat down with <a href="https://indiebio.co/team/arvind-gupta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arvind Gupta</a>, Founder and Managing Director of IndieBio and talked about how Lean methods apply to Life Sciences.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEBlaMOmKV4">I know a change is going to come</a></em></p>
<p>If you’re an early employee at a startup, one day you will wake up to find that what you worked on 24/7 for the last year is no longer the most important thing &#8211; you’re no longer the most important employee, and process, meetings, paperwork and managers and bosses have shown up. Most painfully, you’ll learn that <a href="https://steveblank.com/2015/02/12/what-do-i-do-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your role in the company has to change</a>.</p>

At times they are painful to watch and difficult to manage. Early in my career I lived it as an employee, and I handled it in the worst possible way.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I wish I had known.</p>
<hr />
<p>I had joined MIPS Computers, my second semiconductor company<strong>, </strong>as the VP of marketing and also took on the role of the acting VP of Sales. During the first year of the company’s life, I was a fireball &#8211; relentless in creating and pursuing opportunities &#8211; getting on an airplane at the drop of a hat to fly anywhere, anytime, to get a design win. I worked with engineering to try to find product/market fit (<a href="https://steveblank.com/2009/11/30/customer-development-is-not-a-focus-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big endian or little endian</a>?) and get the chip designed into companies building engineering workstations &#8211; powerful personal computers, all while trying to refine how to find the right markets, customers, and sales process. I didn’t get much sleep, but I was having the time of my life.</p>
<p>And after a year there was good news. Our rent-a-CEO was being replaced by a permanent one. Our chip was nearing completion, and I had convinced early <a href="http://blog.alchemistaccelerator.com/lighthouse-customers-four-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighthouse customers</a> to design it into their computers. I had done amazing things with almost no resources and got the company on the radar of every tech publication and into deals we had no right to be in. I was feeling 10 feet tall. Everything was great… until the new CEO called me in for a chat.</p>
<p>I don’t remember much about the details, but I do remember hearing him tell me how impressed he was with what I had accomplished so far, then immediately the visceral feeling of shock and surprise when his next words were that now the company needed to scale, and I wasn’t the right person to do that… Wait! What??</p>
<p>For a minute I couldn’t breathe. I felt like I had been punched in the gut. How could that be?  What do you mean I’m not the right person??? Hadn’t he just listed all the great work I had done? He acknowledged it was a lot of progress but offered that it was a flurry of disconnected tactics without a coherent strategy. No one knew what I was doing, and I couldn’t explain why I was doing it when asked. “You’re just throwing stuff against the wall. That doesn’t scale.” I was speechless. Wasn’t that what the first year of a startup was supposed to be like?</p>
<p>Scrambling to save my job, I regained the power of speech, and asked him if I could be the person to take the company to the next level. And to his credit (which I only appreciated years later) he agreed that while he was going to start a search, I could be a candidate for the job. And to top it off he got me a coach to help me understand what taking it to the next level meant. In preparation I remember buying all the management books I could find and reading what little literature there was at the time about how small company management transitioned into a larger one.</p>
<p><strong>And herein lies the tale….<br />
</strong>I vaguely remember going to lunch with my coach, a nice white-haired “old guy” who was trying to help me learn the skills to grow into the new job. The problem was I had shut down. Even as we were meeting, I was obsessively thinking about the change in my role, my title and my status. “I don’t get it, I did all this work, and everything was great. <em>Why does anything have to change</em>?”  But I never shared any of how I felt with my coach. To do this day I am really embarrassed to admit that I have no idea what my coach tried to teach me over multiple lunches and weeks. As we went to lunch, all I could think about was me and how I was being screwed. I literally paid zero attention. In my righteous anger I was unreachable.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have been surprised, but yet again I was, when a month later the CEO said, that the report from the coach said, “I had a long way to go”. The company was going to hire a VP of Marketing. I was devastated.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p><b>It&#8217;s Not About Change &#8211; It&#8217;s About Loss<br />
</b>If you had asked me a decade later what had been going on in my head and why I handled this so badly, I would have simply said, that: 1) I was resistant to change, and that 2) I had made this all about me and never once considered that our new CEO was right<em>. </em>All true &#8211; to a point.</p>
<p>It took me another decade to realize if I had been really honest with myself <em>it wasn’t about fighting change at all</em>. Heck every day something new was happening at our startup. I was agile enough to keep up with innumerable changes and I was changing lots of things myself. It was actually about something much more personal I wouldn’t admit to myself &#8211; it was that <em><a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/article/09306?gko=5df7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these changes made me fear what I was losing</a></em>;</p>
<ul>
<li>I felt a <em>l</em><em>oss of status and identity </em>– I had been judged inadequate to continue in my role and my stature and the value of my skills and abilities had dropped.</li>
<li>I felt a <em>loss of certainty </em>&#8211; I was now competing to hold a job I thought was mine forever in the company. At least that’s what I thought my business card said. Now I was adrift and didn’t know what the future held.</li>
<li>I felt a loss of <em>autonomy &#8211; </em>Up until now I used my best judgment of what was needed and I was doing what I wanted, when I wanted it. I was fine making up a strategy on the fly from disconnected tactics. Now we were going to have plans and a strategy.</li>
<li>I felt a <em>loss of community </em>– we had been a small tight team who had bonded together under extreme pressure and accomplished amazing things. Now new people who knew none of that and appreciated little of it were coming in. They had little trust and empathy with us.</li>
<li>I felt <em>the process lacked fairness &#8211;</em> no one had warned/told me that the job I was doing needed to change over time, and no one told me what those new skills were.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What was going on?<br />
</strong>Researchers have found there’s a <a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/article/09306?gko=5df7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link between social connection and physical discomfort</a> within the brain. “Being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses because <a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/article/09306?gko=5df7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being socially connected is necessary for survival</a>. Although a job is often regarded as a purely economic transaction, <em>the brain experiences the workplace first and foremost as a social system</em>.”</p>
<p>Looking back over the decades it’s clear that the new CEO was right. Even though these losses triggered something primal, I did need to learn discipline, pattern recognition, time management, separating the trivial from the important and the difference between tactics and strategy. I needed to learn to grow from being a great individual contributor to being a manager and then a leader. Instead I walked away from learning any of it.</p>
<p>I probably added five unneeded years to my career.</p>
<p><strong>What should I have done?<br />
</strong>Today it’s understood that all startups <a href="https://steveblank.com/2015/02/12/what-do-i-do-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go through a metamorphosis as they become larger companies</a>. They go from organizations struggling for survival as they search for product/market fit, to building a repeatable and scalable business model, and then growing to profitability. And we are all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hard-wired for a set number</a> of social relationships. This mental wiring defines boundaries in growing an organization – get bigger than a certain size, and you need a different management system. The skills needed from employees differ at each stage.</p>

This sentence is worth reading multiple times as no one &#8211; not the person who hired you, the VC’s or your peers -is going to tell you when you&#8217;re hired <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that the company will likely outgrow you.</span> Some (like your peers or even the founders) don’t understand it, and others (the VCs) realize it’s not in their interest to let you know. The painful reality is that products change, strategies change, people change&#8230;things have to change for your company to stay in business and grow.</p>
<p><strong>What should my CEO have done?<br />
</strong>When my CEO was explaining to me how the company needed to change to grow, he was explaining facts while I was processing deeply held feelings. The <em>changes in the organization and my role represented what I was about to lose</em>. And when people feel they’re going to lose something deeply important, it triggers an emotional response because change feels like a threat. It&#8217;s not an excuse for my counterproductive behavior, but explains why I acted out like I did.</p>
<p>Startup CEOs need to <u>think about these transitions from day one </u>and consider <em>how to address the real sense of loss these transitions mean to early employees</em>.</p>
<p><em>Loss of status</em>? It’s almost impossible to take away a title from someone, give it to someone else and still retain that employee. Think hard about whether titles need to be formal (VP of Engineering, VP of Marketing, VP of Sales, etc.) before the company finds product/market fit and/or tens of people – as you can almost guarantee that these people won’t have those roles and titles when you scale.</p>
<p><em>Loss of Certainty? </em>Startups and VC’s have historically operated on the “I’ll deal with this later” principle in letting early employees know what happens as the company scales. The common wisdom is that no one would want to work like crazy knowing that they might not be the ones to lead as the company grows. I call this the Moses-problem – you work for years to get the tribe to the promised land &#8211; but you’re not allowed to cross over. The company needs to give formal recognition for those individuals who brought the tribe to the promised land.</p>
<p><em>Loss of Autonomy? </em>This is the time you and your employees get to have a discussion about the next steps in their career. Do they want to be an individual contributor? Manager of people and process? Special projects? These shouldn&#8217;t be random assignments but instead, offer a roadmap of possible choices and directions.</p>
<p><em>Loss of Community? </em>Your original hires embody the company culture. Unless you have them capture the unique aspects of the culture, it will become diluted and disappear among the new hires. Declare them <em><a href="https://mastersofscale.com/#/aneel-bhusri-the-elusive-formula-for-great-hiring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural co-founders</a>. </em>Help them understand the community is growing and they’re the ambassadors. Have them formalize it as part of a now needed on-boarding process as the company grows. And most importantly, make sure that they are celebrated as the team that got the company to where it is now.</p>
<p><em>Loss of Fairness?</em> Just telling employees “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEBlaMOmKV4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a change is going to come</a>” it is not sufficient. What are the new skills needed when you scale from Search to Build to Grow – from tens to hundreds and then thousands of people? How can your existing employees gain those new skills?</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>VC’s, Founders and CEOs now recognize that startups grow through different stages: <a href="https://steveblank.com/2015/02/12/what-do-i-do-now/">Search, Build and Grow</a>
<ul>
<li>They recognize that employees need different skills at each stage</li>
<li>And that some of the original employees won&#8217;t grow into the next stage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But while these changes make rational sense to the CEO and the board, to early employees these changes feel like a real and tangible personal <a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/article/09306?gko=5df7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loss</a>
<ul>
<li>Loss of Status and Identity</li>
<li>Loss of Community</li>
<li>Loss of Autonomy</li>
<li>Loss of Certainty</li>
<li>Loss of Fairness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CEOs need to put processes in places to acknowledge and deal with the real sense of loss
<ul>
<li>These will keep early employees motivated – and retained</li>
<li>And build a stronger company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For employees, how you handle change will affect the trajectory of your career and possibly your net worth</li>
</ul>

</a>That’s it. A single screen replacing all the dashboard gauges, knobs and switches. But behind that screen is an increasing level of automation that hides a ton of complexity.</p>
<p>At times everything you need is on the screen with a glance. At other times you have to page through menus and poke at the screen while driving. And while driving at 70mph, try to understand if you or your automated driving system is in control of your car. All while figuring out how to use any of the new features, menus or rearranged user interface that might have been updated overnight.</p>
<p>In the beginning of any technology revolution the technology gets ahead of the institutions designed to measure and regulate safety and standards. Both the vehicle’s designers and regulators will eventually catch up, but in the meantime we’re on the steep part of a learning curve &#8211; part of a million-person beta test &#8211; about what’s the right driver-to-vehicle interface.</p>
<p>We went through this with airplanes. And we’re reliving that transition in cars. Things will break, but in a few decades we’ll come out out the other side, look back and wonder how people ever drove any other way.</p>
<p>Here’s how we got here, what it’s going to cost us, and where we’ll end up.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Cars, Computers and Safety</strong><br />
Two massive changes are occurring in automobiles: 1) the transition from internal combustion engines to electric, and 2) the introduction of automated driving.</p>
<p>But a third equally important change that’s also underway is the (r)evolution of car dashboards from dials and buttons to computer screens. For the first 100 years cars were essentially a mechanical platform &#8211; an internal combustion engine and transmission with seats &#8211; controlled by mechanical steering, accelerator and brakes. Instrumentation to monitor the car was made up of dials and gauges; a speedometer, tachometer, and fuel, water and battery gauges. <a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="24780" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/impala-zoom-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg" data-orig-size="672,358" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Impala zoom" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg?w=468" class="wp-image-24780 size-large aligncenter" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg?w=468&#038;h=249" alt="" width="468" height="249" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg?w=468&amp;h=249 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg?w=150&amp;h=80 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg?w=300&amp;h=160 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a><a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/impala-zoom.png"><br />
</a>By the 1970’s driving became easier as automatic transmissions replaced manual gear shifting and hydraulically assisted steering and brakes became standard. Comfort features evolved as well: climate control &#8211; first heat, later air-conditioning; and entertainment &#8211; AM radio, FM radio, 8-track tape, CD’s, and today streaming media. In the last decade GPS-driven navigation systems began to appear.</p>
<p><em>Safety</em><br />
At the same time cars were improving, automobile companies <a href="http://www.robertabelllaw.com/library/Driven_to_Safety__How_Litigation_Spurred_Auto_Safety_Innovations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fought safety improvements</a> tooth and nail. By the 1970’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto deaths in the U.S</a> averaged 50,000 a year. Over 3.7 million people have died in cars in the U.S. since they appeared – more than all U.S. war deaths combined. (This puts auto companies in the rarified class of companies – along with tobacco companies – that have killed millions of their own customers.) Car companies argued that talking safety would scare off customers, or that the added cost of safety features would put them in a competitive price disadvantage. But in reality, style was valued over safety.</p>

Today we’re about to enter a fourth generation &#8211; <em>autonomous</em> systems.</p>
<p><em>Passive safety systems </em>are features that protect the occupants <em>after </em>a crash has occurred. They started appearing in cars in the 1930’s. <a href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-driving-safety/safety-regulatory-devices/auto-glass1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safety glass</a> in windshields appeared in the 1930’s in response to horrific disfiguring crashes. Padded dashboards were added in the 1950’s but it took Ralph Nader’s book, <em><a href="https://www.pe.com/2015/12/04/50-years-ago-ralph-naders-unsafe-at-any-speed-shook-the-auto-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsafe at Any Speed</a>, </em>to spur <em>federally mandated </em>passive safety features in the U.S. beginning in the 1960’s: seat belts, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumple_zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crumple zones</a>, collapsible steering wheels, four-way flashers and even better windshields. The Department of Transportation was <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/50/creation-department-transportation-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created in 1966</a> but it wasn’t until 1979 that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA</a>) started crash-testing cars (the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety started their testing in 1995). In 1984 New York State mandated seat belt use (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_laws_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now required</a> in 49 of the 50 states.)</p>
<p>These passive safety features started to pay off in the mid-1970’s as overall auto deaths in the U.S. began to decline.</p>
<p><em>Active</em> safety systems try to prevent crashes <em>before</em> they happen. These depended on the invention of low-cost, automotive-grade computers and sensors. For example, accelerometers-on-a-chip made airbags possible as they were able to detect a crash in progress. These began to appear in cars in the late 1980’s/1990’s and were required in 1998. In the 1990’s computers capable of real-time analysis of wheel sensors (position and slip) made ABS (anti-lock braking systems) possible. This feature was finally required in 2013.</p>
<p>Since 2005 a <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/cars-with-advanced-safety-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second generation</a> of <em>active </em>safety features have appeared. They run in the background and constantly monitor the vehicle and space around it for potential hazards. They include: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electronic Stability Control</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/blind-spot-warning-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blind Spot Detection</a>, Forward Collision Warning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_departure_warning_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lane Departure Warning</a>, Rearview Video Systems, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/automatic-emergency-braking-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automatic Emergency Braking</a>, Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking, Rear Automatic Emergency Braking, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Lane Centering Assist.</p>

<p><em>Autonomous Cars<br />
</em>Today, a fourth wave of safety features is appearing as Autonomous/Self-Driving features. These include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_centering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lane Centering/Auto Steer</a>, Adaptive cruise control, Traffic jam assist, <a href="https://www.confused.com/on-the-road/gadgets-tech/parking-technology-brief-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Self-parking</a>, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full self-driving</a>. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA</a>) has adopted the six-level <a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_201806/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAE standard</a> to describe these vehicle automation features:</p>

<p>Getting above Level 2 is a <em>really hard</em> technical problem and has been discussed ad infinitum in other places. But what hasn’t got much attention is how drivers interact with these systems as the level of automation increases, and as the driving role shifts from the driver to the vehicle. Today, we don’t know whether there are times these features make cars less safe rather than more.</p>
<p>For example, Tesla and other cars have Level 2 and some Level 3 auto-driving features. Under Level 2 automation, <em>drivers are supposed to monitor the automated driving</em> because the system can hand back control of the car to you with little or no warning. In Level 3 automation <em>drivers are not expected to monitor the environment</em>, but again they are expected to be prepared to take control of the vehicle at all times, this time with notice.</p>
<p>Research suggests that drivers, when they aren’t actively controlling the vehicle, may be reading their phone, eating, looking at the scenery, etc. We really don’t know how drivers will perform in Level 2 and 3 automation. Drivers can lose <em>situational awareness </em>when they’re surprised by the behavior of the automation – asking: What is it doing now? Why did it do that? Or, what is it going to do next? There are open questions as to whether drivers can attain/sustain sufficient attention to take control before they hit something. (Trust me, at highway speeds having a “take over immediately” symbol pop up while you are gazing at the scenery raises your blood pressure, and hopefully your reaction time.)<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png"><img data-attachment-id="24729" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/take-over/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png" data-orig-size="349,95" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="take over" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png?w=349" class="wp-image-24729 aligncenter" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png?w=320&#038;h=87" alt="" width="320" height="87" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png?w=320&amp;h=87 320w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png?w=150&amp;h=41 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png?w=300&amp;h=82 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/take-over.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>If these technical challenges weren&#8217;t enough for drivers to manage, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">these autonomous driving features are appearing at the same time that car dashboards are becoming computer displays</span>.</p>
<p>We never had cars that worked like this. Not only will users have to get used to dashboards that are now computer displays, they are going to have understand the subtle differences between automated and semi-automated features and do so as auto makers are developing and constantly updating them. They may not have much help mastering the changes. Most users don’t read the manual, and, in some cars, the manuals aren’t even keeping up with the new features.</p>
<p>But while we never had cars that worked like this, we already have planes that do.<br />
Let’s see what we’ve learned in 100 years of designing controls and automation for aircraft cockpits and pilots, and what it might mean for cars.</p>
<p><strong>Aircraft Cockpits</strong><br />
Airplanes have gone through multiple generations of aircraft and cockpit automation. But unlike cars which are just first seeing automated systems, automation was first introduced in airplanes during the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p>For their first 35 years airplane cockpits, much like early car dashboards, were simple – a few mechanical instruments for speed, altitude, relative heading and fuel. By the late 1930’s the British Royal Air Force (RAF) standardized on a set of <em>flight instruments</em>. Over the next decade this evolved into the &#8220;Basic T&#8221; instrument layout &#8211; the de facto standard of how aircraft flight instruments were laid out.<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="24785" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/basic-t_aa_1-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,636" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Basic-T_AA_1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg?w=468" class="wp-image-24785 alignright size-medium" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg?w=300&#038;h=186" alt="" width="300" height="186" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg?w=300&amp;h=186 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg?w=600&amp;h=372 600w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/basic-t_aa_11.jpg?w=150&amp;h=93 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><em>Engine instruments</em> were added to measure the health of the aircraft engines – fuel and oil quantity, pressure, and temperature and engine speed.</p>
<p>Next, as airplanes became bigger, and the aerodynamic forces increased, it became difficult to manually move the control surfaces so pneumatic or hydraulic motors were added to increase the pilots’ physical force. Mechanical devices like <a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/how-it-works-yaw-damper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yaw dampers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_tuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mach trim</a> compensators corrected the behavior of the plane.</p>
<p>Over time, <em>navigation instruments</em> were added to cockpits. At first, they were simple autopilots to just keep the plane straight and level and on a compass course. The next addition was a radio receiver to pick up signals from navigation stations. This was so pilots could set the desired bearing to the ground station into a course deviation display, and the autopilot would fly the displayed course.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, electrical systems began to replace the mechanical systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>electric gyroscopes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_navigation_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INS</a>) and autopilots using <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Navigate-Using-a-VOR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VOR</a> (Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range) radio beacons to follow a track</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flaps2approach.com/journal/2014/9/2/b737-autothrottle-at-normal-and-non-normal-operations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">auto-throttle</a> &#8211; to manage engine power in order to maintain a selected speed</li>
<li><a href="https://okigihan.blogspot.com/2017/05/flight-director-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flight director displays</a> &#8211; to show pilots how to fly the aircraft to achieve a preselected speed and flight path</li>
<li><a href="https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Weather_Radar:_Storm_Avoidance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weather radars</a> &#8211; to see and avoid storms</li>
<li><a href="https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Instrument_Landing_System_(ILS)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instrument Landing Systems</a> &#8211; to help automate landings by giving the aircraft horizontal and vertical guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>By 1960 a modern jet cockpit (the Boeing 707) looked like this:<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="24782" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/707-cockpit-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,750" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="707 cockpit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=468" class="wp-image-24782 size-large aligncenter" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=468&#038;h=343" alt="" width="468" height="343" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=468&amp;h=343 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=936&amp;h=686 936w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=150&amp;h=110 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=300&amp;h=220 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/707-cockpit.jpg?w=768&amp;h=563 768w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p>While it might look complicated, each of the aircraft instruments displayed a single piece of data. Switches and knobs were all electromechanical.</p>
<p><strong>Enter the Glass Cockpit and Autonomous Flying<br />
</strong>Fast forward to today and the third generation of aircraft automation. Today’s aircraft might look similar from the outside but on the inside four things are radically different:</p>
<ol>
<li>The clutter of instruments in the cockpit has been replaced with color displays creating a “glass cockpit”</li>
<li>The airplanes engines got their own dedicated computer systems &#8211; <a href="https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Full_Authority_Digital_Engine_Control_(FADEC)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FADEC</a> (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) – to autonomously control the engines</li>
<li>The engines themselves are an order of magnitude more reliable</li>
<li>Navigation systems have turned into full-blown autonomous flight management systems</li>

<p>So today a modern airplane cockpit (an Airbus 320) looks like this:<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="24783" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/a320-cockpit-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,630" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="A320 cockpit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=468" class="wp-image-24783 size-large aligncenter" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=468&#038;h=288" alt="" width="468" height="288" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=468&amp;h=288 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=936&amp;h=576 936w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=300&amp;h=185 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/a320-cockpit.jpg?w=768&amp;h=473 768w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p>Today, airplane navigation is a real-world example of autonomous driving &#8211; in the sky. Two additional systems, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain_awareness_and_warning_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems </a>(TAWS) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traffic Condition Avoidance System </a>(TCAS) gave pilots a view of what’s underneath and around them dramatically increasing pilots&#8217; situation awareness and flight safety. (Autonomy in the air is technically a much simpler problem because in the cruise portion of flight there are a lot less things to worry about in the air than in a car.)</p>
<p>Navigation in planes has turned into autonomous “flight management.” Instead of a course deviation dial, navigation information is now presented as a “moving map” on a display showing the position of navigation waypoints, by latitude and longitude. The position of the airplane no longer uses ground radio stations, but rather is determined by Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites or autonomous inertial reference units. The route of flight is pre-programmed by the pilot (or uploaded automatically) and the pilot can connect the autopilot to autonomously fly the displayed route. Pilots enter navigation data into the Flight Management System, with a keyboard. The flight management system also automates vertical and lateral navigation, fuel and balance optimization, throttle settings, critical speed calculation and execution of take-offs and landings.</p>
<p>Automating the airplane cockpit relieved pilots from repetitive tasks and allowed less skilled pilots to fly safely. Commercial airline safety dramatically increased as the commercial jet airline fleet <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247117069_Fleet_composition_of_commercial_jet_aircraft_1952-2005_Developments_in_uniformity_and_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quadrupled in size</a> from ~5,000 in 1980 to over 20,000 today. (Most passengers today would be surprised to find out how much of their flight was flown by the autopilot versus the pilot.)<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png"><img data-attachment-id="24772" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/airline-safety-3/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png" data-orig-size="880,660" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="airline safety" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png?w=468" class="wp-image-24772 size-large aligncenter" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png?w=468&#038;h=351" alt="" width="468" height="351" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png?w=468&amp;h=351 468w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/airline-safety2.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why Cars Are Like Airplanes</strong><br />
And here lies the connection between what’s happened to airplanes with what is about to happen to cars.</p>
<p>The downside of glass cockpits and cockpit automation means that pilots no longer actively operating the aircraft but instead <em>monitor</em> it. And humans are particularly poor at monitoring for long periods. Pilots have lost basic manual and cognitive flying skills because of a lack of practice and feel for the aircraft. In addition, the need to “manage” the automation, particularly when involving data entry or retrieval through a key-pad, increased rather than decreased the pilot workload. And when systems fail, poorly designed user interfaces reduce a pilot’s situational awareness and can create cognitive overload.</p>
<p>Today, pilot errors &#8212; not mechanical failures&#8211; cause at least <a href="https://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/2000s/media/0103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70-80% of commercial airplane accidents</a>. The FAA and NTSB have been analyzing crashes and have been <a href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/human_factors/media/OUFPMS_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing extensively on how flight deck automation is affecting pilots</a>. (Crashes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiana_Airlines_Flight_214" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asiana 214</a> happened when pilots selected the wrong mode on a computer screen.) The FAA has written the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yaghzev0eawl1e6/Human_Factors_Considerations_in_the_Design_and_Evaluation_of_Flight_Deck_Displays_and_Controls_V2.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitive document</a> how people and automated systems ought to interact.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA</a>) has found that <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">94% of car crashes are due to human error </a>– bad choices drivers make such as inattention, distraction, driving too fast, poor judgment/performance, drunk driving, lack of sleep.</p>
<p>NHTSA has begun to investigate how people will interact with both displays and automation in cars. They’re beginning to figure out:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the right way to design a driver-to-vehicle interface on a screen to show:
<ul>
<li>Vehicle status gauges and knobs (speedometer, fuel/range, time, climate control)</li>
<li>Navigation maps and controls</li>
<li>Media/entertainment systems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you design for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1420063553/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1420063553&amp;linkId=88a949fefc574b589fbeb3f5ff834ce7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">situation awareness</a>?
<ul>
<li>What’s the best driver-to-vehicle interface to display the state of vehicle automation and Autonomous/Self-Driving features?</li>
<li>How do you manage the information available to understand what&#8217;s currently happening and project what will happen next?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What’s the right level of <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018720817690639" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive load </a>when designing interfaces for decisions that have to be made in milliseconds?
<ul>
<li>What’s the distraction level from mobile devices? For example, how does your car handle your phone? Is it integrated into the system or do you have to fumble to use it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you design a user interface for millions of users whose age may span from 16-90; with different eyesight, reaction time, and ability to learn new screen layouts and features?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of their findings are in the document <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/13494_812555_l2l3automationhfguidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human-centric design guidance for driver-vehicle interfaces</a>. But what’s striking is that very little of the NHSTA documents reference the decades of expensive lessons that the aircraft industry has learned. Glass cockpits and aircraft autonomy have traveled this road before. Even though aviation safety lessons have to be tuned to the different reaction times needed in cars (airplanes fly 10 times faster, yet pilots often have seconds or minutes to respond to problems, while in a car the decisions often have to be made in milliseconds) there’s a lot they can learn together. Aviation has gone 9 years in the U.S. with just one fatality, yet in <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/policy-initiatives/automated-vehicles/320711/preparing-future-transportation-automated-vehicle-30.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 37,000</a> people died in car crashes in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>There Are No Safety Ratings for Your Car As You Drive<br />
</strong>In the U.S. aircraft safety has been <em>proactive</em>. Since 1927 new types aircraft (<a href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/media/CPI_guide.pdf">and each sub-assembly</a>) are required to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_certificate">type approval</a> from the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/orig_des_approv_proc/">FAA</a> before it can be sold and be issued an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airworthiness_certificate">Airworthiness Certificate</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike aircraft, car safety in the U.S. has been <em>reactive</em>. New models don’t require a type approval, instead each car company self-certifies that their car meets <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/laws_regs/pdf/Manufacturer_Information_12022015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal safety standards</a>. NHTSA waits until a defect has emerged and then can issue a <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recall</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to know how safe your model of car will be during a crash, you can look at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Car_Assessment_Program">New Car Assessment Program</a> (NCAP) crash-tests, or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) <a href="https://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safety ratings</a>. Both summarize how well the active and passive safety systems will perform in frontal, side, and rollover crashes. But today, there are no equivalent ratings for how safe cars are <em>while you’re driving them</em>. What is considered a good vs. bad user interface and do they have different crash rates? Does the transition from Level 1, 2 and 3 autonomy confuse drivers to the point of causing crashes? How do you measure and test these systems? What’s the role of regulators in doing so?</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA</a> and the <a href="https://www.faa.gov">FAA</a> are both in the Department of Transportation (<a href="https://www.transportation.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoT</a>), It makes you wonder whether these government agencies actively talk to and collaborate with each other and have <em>integrated programs</em> and common best practices. And whether they have extracted best practices from the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTSB.</a> And from the early efforts of Tesla, Audi, Volvo, BMW, etc., it’s not clear they’ve looked at the airplane lessons either.</p>
<p>It seems like the logical thing for NHTSA to do during this autonomous transition is 1) start defining <span class="">“best practices” in U/I and automation safety interfaces and 2) to </span>test Level 2-4 cars for safety while you drive (like the crash tests but for situational awareness, cognitive load, etc. in a set of driving scenarios. (There are <a href="https://ddl.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great university programs</a> already doing that research.)</p>
<p><span class="">However, the</span><span class=""> </span><a class="" href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/policy-initiatives/automated-vehicles/320711/preparing-future-transportation-automated-vehicle-30.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DoT&#8217;s Automated Vehicles 3.0</a><span class=""> plan moves the agency further from owning the role of “best practices” in U/I and automation safety interfaces. It assumes that car companies will do a good job self-certifying these new technologies. And </span><span class=""><em>has no plans for safety testing and rating</em></span><span class=""> these new Level 2-4 autonomous features.</span></p>
<p>(Keep in mind that publishing <em>best practices </em>and <em>testing</em> for autonomous safety features is not the same as imposing regulations to slow down innovation.)</p>
<p>It looks like it might take an independent agency like the SAE to propose some best practices and ratings. (Or the slim possibility that the auto industry comes together and set defacto standards.)</p>
<p><strong>The Chaotic Transition</strong><br />
It took 30 years, from 1900 to 1930, to transition from horses and buggies in city streets to automobiles dominating traffic. During that time former buggy drivers had to learn a completely new set of rules to control their cars. And the roads in those 30 years were a mix of traffic – it was chaotic.<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="24789" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/horse-and-buggy-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,312" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="horse and buggy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg?w=468" class="wp-image-24789 alignright size-medium" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=91" alt="" width="300" height="91" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg?w=300&amp;h=91 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg?w=597&amp;h=182 597w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/horse-and-buggy.jpg?w=150&amp;h=46 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
In New York City the tipping point was 1908 when the number of cars passed the number of horses. The last horse-drawn trolley left the streets of New York in 1917. (It took another decade or two to displace the horse from farms, public transport and wagon delivery systems.) Today, we’re about to undergo the same transition.</p>
<p>Cars are on the path for full autonomy, but we’re seeing two different approaches on how to achieve Level 4 and 5 “hands off” driverless cars. Existing car manufacturers, locked into the existing car designs, are approaching this step-wise – adding additional levels of autonomy over time – with new models or updates; while new car startups (<a href="https://waymo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waymo</a>, <a href="https://zoox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoox</a>, <a href="https://getcruise.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cruise</a>, etc.) are attempting to go right to Level 4 and 5.</p>

<p>We’re going to have 20 or so years with the roads full of a mix of millions of cars – some being manually driven, some with Level 2 and 3 driver assistance features, and others autonomous vehicles with “hands-off” Level 4 and 5 autonomy. It may take at least 20 years before autonomous vehicles become the dominant platforms. In the meantime, this mix of traffic is going to be chaotic. (Some suggest that during this transition we require autonomous vehicles to have signs in their rear window, like student drivers, but this time saying, “Caution AI on board.”)<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="24787" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/29/driven-to-distraction-the-future-of-car-safety/ai-driver-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg" data-orig-size="871,642" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="AI Driver" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg?w=468" class="alignright wp-image-24787" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg?w=100&#038;h=74" alt="" width="100" height="74" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg?w=100&amp;h=74 100w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg?w=200&amp;h=148 200w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ai-driver.jpg?w=150&amp;h=111 150w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px" /></a></p>
<p>As there will be no government best practices for U/I or scores for autonomy safety, learning and discovery will be happening on the road. That makes the ability for car companies to have over-the-air updates for both the dashboard user interface and the automated driving features essential. Incremental and iterative updates will add new features, while fixing bad ones. Engaging customers to make them realize they&#8217;re part of the journey will ultimately make this a successful experiment.</p>
<p>My bet is much like when airplanes went to glass cockpits with increasingly automated systems, we’ll create new ways drivers crash their cars, while ultimately increasing overall vehicle safety.</p>
<p>But in the next decade or two, with the government telling car companies &#8220;roll your own&#8221;, it&#8217;s going to be one heck of a ride.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There’s a (r)evolution as car dashboards move from dials and buttons to computer screens and the introduction of automated driving
<ul>
<li>Computer screens and autonomy will both create new problems for drivers</li>
<li>There are no standards to measure the safety of these systems</li>
<li>There are no standards for how information is presented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aircraft cockpits are 10 to 20 years ahead of car companies in studying and solving this problem
<ul>
<li>Car and aircraft regulators need to share their learnings</li>
<li>Car companies can reduce crashes and deaths if they look to aircraft cockpit design for car user interface lessons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Department of Transportation has removed barriers to the rapid adoption of autonomous vehicles
<ul>
<li>Car companies &#8220;self-certify&#8221; whether their U/I and autonomy are safe</li>
<li>There are no equivalents of crash safety scores for <em>driving safety</em> <em>with autonomous features</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Over-the-air updates for car software will become essential
<ul>
<li>But the downside is they could dramatically change the U/I without warning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the path for full autonomy we’ll have three generations of cars on the road
<ul>
<li>The transition will be chaotic, so hang on it’s going to a bumpy ride, but the destination &#8211; safety for everyone on the road &#8211; will be worth it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The Fixer </em>is 1/3<sup>rd </sup>autobiography, 1/3<sup>rd </sup>case studies, and 1/3<sup>rd </sup>a “how-to” manual. <em>Regulatory Hacking </em>is closer to a “step-by-step” textbook with case studies.</p>
<p>Here’s why you need to read them.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the great things about teaching has been seeing the innovative, unique, groundbreaking and sometimes simply crazy ideas of my students. They use the Business Model (or <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission Model</a>) Canvas to keep track of their key hypotheses and then rapidly test them by talking to customers and iterating their <a href="https://steveblank.com/2013/07/22/an-mvp-is-not-a-cheaper-product-its-about-smart-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimal Viable Products</a>. This allows them to quickly find product/market fit.</p>
<p>Except when they’re in a regulated market.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation<br />
</strong>All businesses have regulations to follow &#8211;  paying taxes, incorporating the company, complying with financial reporting. And some have to ensure that there are no patents or <a href="https://www.patentlawyer.io/what-is-a-blocking-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocking patents.  </a>But<em> regulated markets </em>are different. Regulated marketplaces are ones that have significant <em>government regulation</em> to promote (ostensibly) the public interest. In theory regulations exist to protect the <em>public interest for the benefit of </em>all citizens. A good example is the regulations the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">FDA</a> (Food and Drug Administration) have in place for approving new drugs and medical devices.<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png"><img data-attachment-id="24669" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/09/startups-and-regulated-markets/laws-and-regs/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png" data-orig-size="1129,1700" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="laws and regs" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png?w=199" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png?w=468" class="size-medium wp-image-24669 alignright" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="" width="199" height="300" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png?w=199&amp;h=300 199w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png?w=398&amp;h=600 398w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/laws-and-regs.png?w=100&amp;h=150 100w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></a></p>
<p>In a regulated market, the government controls how products and services are allowed to enter the market, what prices may be charged, what features the product/service must have, safety of the product, environmental regulations, labor laws, domestic/foreign content, etc.</p>
<p>In the U.S. regulation happens on three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>federal laws that are applicable across the country are developed by Federal government in Washington</li>
<li>state laws that are applicable in one state are imposed by state government</li>
<li>local city and county laws come from local government.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Federal Government<br />
</em>In the U.S. the national government has regulatory authority over inter-state commerce, foreign trade and other business activities of national scope and interest. Congress decides what things needs to be regulated and passes laws that determine those regulations. Congress often does not include all the details needed to explain how an individual, business, state or local government, or others might follow the law. In order to make the laws work on a day-to-day level, Congress authorizes certain government agencies to write the regulations which set the specific requirements about what is legal and what isn&#8217;t.  The regulatory agencies then oversee these requirements.</p>
<p>In the U.S. startups might run into an alphabet soup of federal regulatory agencies, for example; <a href="https://www.atf.gov/">ATF</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">CFPB</a>, <a href="https://www.dea.gov/">DEA</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">EPA</a>, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/">FAA</a>, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a>, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">FDA</a>, <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/">FDIC</a>, <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/">FERC</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/">FTC</a>, <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/">OCC</a>, <a href="https://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">SEC</a>. These agencies exist because Congress passed laws.</p>
<p><em>States<br />
</em>In addition to federal laws, each State has its own regulatory environment that applies to businesses operating within the state in areas such as land-use, zoning, motor vehicles, state banking, building codes, public utilities, drug laws, etc.</p>
<p><em>Cities/Counties<br />
</em>Finally, local municipalities (cities, counties) may have local laws and regulatory agencies or departments like taxi commissions, zoning laws, public safety, permitting, building codes, sanitation, drug laws, etc.</p>
<p><strong>A Playbook for Entering a Regulated Market<br />
</strong>Startup battles with regulatory agencies &#8211; like Uber with local taxi licensing laws, AirBnB with local zoning laws, and Tesla with state dealership licensing &#8211; are legendary. Each of these is an example of a startup disrupting regulated markets.</p>
<p>There’s nothing magical about dealing with regulated markets. However, every regulated market has its own rules, dynamics, language, players, politics, etc. And they are all very different from the business-to-consumer or business-to-business markets most founders <em>and their investors </em>are familiar with.</p>
<p>How do you know you’re in a regulated market? It’s simple&#8211; ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I do anything I want or are there laws and regulations that might stop me or slow me down?</li>
<li>Are there incumbents who will view us as a threat to the status quo<em>? </em>Can they use laws and regulations to impede our growth?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Diagram Your Business Model<br />
</em>The best way to start is by <a href="https://steveblank.com/2010/10/25/entrepreneurship-as-a-science-%E2%80%93-the-business-modelcustomer-development-stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drawing a business model canvas</a>. In the customer segments box, you’re going to discover that there may be 5, 10 or more different players: users, beneficiaries, stakeholders, payers, saboteur, rent seeker, influencers, bureaucrats, politician, regulators. As you get out of the building and start talking to people you’ll discover more and more players.</p>
<p><a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png"><img data-attachment-id="24670" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/09/startups-and-regulated-markets/canvas-and-value-prop/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png" data-orig-size="3754,2062" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="canvas and value prop" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png?w=468" class="size-medium alignleft wp-image-24670" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png?w=300&#038;h=165" alt="" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png?w=300&amp;h=165 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png?w=600&amp;h=330 600w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/canvas-and-value-prop.png?w=150&amp;h=82 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of lumping them together, each of these users, beneficiaries, stakeholders, payers, saboteur, rent seekers, etc. require a <em>separate </em><a href="https://steveblank.com/2014/10/24/17577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Value Proposition Canvas</a>. This is where you start figuring out not only their pains, gains and jobs to be done, but what products/services solve those pains and gains. When you do that, you’ll discover that the interests of your product’s end user versus a regulator versus an advocacy group, key opinion leaders or a politician, are radically different. For you to succeed <em>you need to understand all of them</em>.</p>
<p>One of the critical things to understand is how the regulatory process works. For example, do you just fill out an online form and pay a $50 fee with your credit card and get a permit? Or do you need to spend millions of dollars and years running clinical trials to get FDA clearance and approval? And are these approvals good in every state? In every country? What do you need to do to sell worldwide?</p>
<p><em>Find the Saboteurs and Rent Seekers<br />
</em>One of the unique things about entering a regulated market is that the incumbents have gotten there first and have “gamed the system” in their favor. <em><a href="http://blog.bearing-consulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/The.Political.Economy.of_.the_.Rent-Seeking.Society.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Rent seekers </u></a></em>are individuals or organizations with successful existing business models who look to the government and regulators as their first line of defense against innovative competition. They use government regulation and lawsuits to keep out new entrants that might threaten their business models. They use every argument from public safety to lack of quality or loss of jobs to lobby against the new entrants. Rent seekers spend money to increase their share of an existing market instead of creating new products or markets but create <em>nothing of value</em>.</p>
<p>These barriers to new innovative startups are called <em><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicrent.asp">economic rent</a>. </em>Examples of economic rent include state automobile franchise laws, taxi medallion laws, limits on charter schools, cable company monopolies, patent trolls, bribery of government officials, corruption and regulatory capture.</p>
<p>Rent seeking lobbyists go directly to legislative bodies (Congress, State Legislatures, City Councils) to persuade government officials to enact laws and regulations in exchange for campaign <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>contributions</u></a>, appeasing influential voting blocks or <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>future jobs in the regulated industry</u></a>. They also <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/04/taking-patent-trolls-protect-american-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>use the courts to tie up and exhaust a startup’s </u></a>limited financial resources. Lobbyists also work through regulatory bodies like the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2013/05/tom--wheeler-federal-communications-commission.html"><u>FCC</u></a>, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/172147/secret-money-lobbyists-fight-sec-disclosure-rule"><u>SEC</u></a>, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/"><u>FTC</u></a>, Public Utility, Taxi, or Insurance Commissions, School Boards, etc.</p>
<p>Although most regulatory bodies are initially created to protect the public’s health and safety, or to provide an equal playing field, <u><a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2566926?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102323655501">o</a><a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2566926?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102323655501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ver time</a></u> the very people they’re supposed to regulate <a href="http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/4/1089.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>capture the regulatory agencies</u></a>. Rent Seekers take advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>regulatory capture</u></a> to protect their interests against the new innovators.</p>
<p><em>Understand Who Pays<br />
</em>For revenue streams figure out who’s going to pay. Is it the end user? An insurer? Some other third party?  If it’s the government, hang on to your seat because you now have to deal with government procurement and/or reimbursement. These payers need a Value Proposition Canvas as well.</p>
<p><em>Customer Relationships<br />
</em>For Customer Relationships, figuring out how to “Get, Keep and Grow” customers in a regulated market is a lot more complex than simply “Let&#8217;s buy some <a href="https://ads.google.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Adwords</a>”. Market entry in a regulated market often has many more moving parts and is much costlier than a traditional market, requiring lobbyists, key opinion leaders, political donations, advocacy groups, and <a href="https://www.thecampaignworkshop.com/grassroots-vs-grasstops-advocacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grassroots</a> and <a href="https://www.thecampaignworkshop.com/grassroots-vs-grasstops-advocacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grasstops</a> campaigns, etc.</p>
<p><em>Diagram the Customer Segment Relationships<br />
</em>Start diagraming out the relationships of all the customer segments. Who influences who? How do they interconnect? What laws and regulations are in your way for deployment and scale? How powerful are each of the players? For the politicians, what are their public positions versus actual votes and performance. Follow the money. If an elected official’s major donor is organization x, you’re not going to be able to convince them with a cogent argument.<br />

<p>The book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yp6Iae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regulatory Hacking </a></em>calls this diagram the <em>Power Map</em>. As an example, this is a diagram of the multiple beneficiaries and stakeholders that a software company developing math software for middle school students has to navigate. Your diagram may be more complex.  There is no possible way you can draw this on day one of your startup. You’ll discover these players as you get out of the building and start filling out your value proposition canvases.</p>
<p><em>Diagram the Competition<br />
</em>Next, draw a competitive <a href="https://steveblank.com/2013/11/08/a-new-way-to-look-at-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petal diagram</a> of competitors and adjacent market players.  Who’s already serving the users you’re targeting? Who are the companies you’re disrupting?</p>
<p>I’ve always thought of my startup as the center of the universe. So, put your company in the center of the slide like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="24676" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/10/09/startups-and-regulated-markets/petal-diagram-2/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg" data-orig-size="1775,1730" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="petal diagram" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg?w=468" class="wp-image-24676 alignleft" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg?w=230&#038;h=224" alt="" width="230" height="224" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg?w=230&amp;h=224 230w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg?w=460&amp;h=448 460w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg?w=150&amp;h=146 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/petal-diagram.jpg?w=300&amp;h=292 300w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></a></p>
<p>In this example the startup is creating a new category – a lifelong learning network for entrepreneurs. To indicate where their customers for this new market would come from they drew the 5 <em>adjacent market segments </em>they believed their future customers were in today: corporate, higher education, startup ecosystem, institutions, and adult learning. To illustrate this they drew these adjacent markets as a cloud surrounding their company. (Unlike the traditional X/Y graph you can draw as many adjacent market segments as you’d like.)</p>
<p>Fill in the market spaces with the names of the companies that are representative players in each of the adjacent markets.</p>
<p><em>Strategy diagram<br />
</em>Finally, draw your strategy diagram – how will you build a repeatable and scalable sales process? What regulatory issues need to be solved? In what order?  What is step 1? Then step 2? For example, beg for forgiveness or ask for permission? How do you get regulators who don’t see a need to change to move? And do so in your lifetime? How do you get your early customers to advocate on your behalf?</p>
<p>I sketched out a sample diagram of some of things to think about in the figure below.

<p><em>Politicians<br />
</em>If you read Tusk’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525536493/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0525536493&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkId=09abff331f7109f4235cbc339d1fdf99">The Fixer </a>you come away with the view that the political process in the U.S. follows the golden rule – he who has the gold makes the rules. It is a personal tale of someone who was deep inside politics – Tusk was deputy governor of Illinois, Mike Bloomberg’s campaign manager, Senator Charles Schumer’s communication director, and ran Uber’s first successful campaign to get regulatory approval in New York. And he is as cynical about politicians as one can get. On the other hand, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yp6Iae">Regulatory Hacking</a> </em>by is written by someone who understands Washington—but still needs to work there.</p>
<p>Read both books.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Regulated markets have different rules and players than traditional Business-to-Business or Business-to-Consumer markets</li>
<li>Entering a regulated market should be a strategy not a disconnected set of tactics</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You need to understand the Laws and Regulations on the federal, state and local levels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You and your board need to be in sync about the costs and risks of entering these markets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Strategic choices include: asking for permission versus forgiveness, public versus private battles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most early stage startups don’t have the regulatory domain expertise in-house. Go get outside advice at each step</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t own an Apple Watch. I do have a Fitbit. But the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Watch 4</a> announcement intrigued me in a way no other product has since the original IPhone. This wasn’t just another product announcement from Apple. It heralded the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) entrance into the 21<sup>st</sup>century. It is a harbinger of the future of healthcare and how the FDA approaches innovation.</p>
<p>Sooner than people think, virtually all home and outpatient diagnostics will be performed by consumer devices such as the Apple Watch, mobile phones, fitness trackers, etc. that have either become FDA cleared as medical devices or have apps that have received FDA clearance. Consumer devices will morph into medical grade devices, with some painful and well publicized mistakes along the way.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it turns out for Apple.</p>
<hr />
<p>Smartwatches are the apex of the most sophisticated electronics on the planet. And the Apple Watch is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple+Watch+Series+4+Teardown/113044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most complex</a> of them all. Packed inside a 40mm wide, 10 mm deep package is a 64-bit computer, 16gbytes of memory, Wi-Fi, NFC, cellular, Bluetooth, GPS, accelerometer, altimeter, gyroscope, heart rate sensor, and an ECG sensor &#8211; displaying it all on a 448 by 368 OLED display.<br />

<p>But as impressive as its technology is, the Apple’s smartwatch has been a product looking for a solution. At first, positioned as a fashion statement, it seemed like the watch was actually an excuse to sell expensive wristbands. Subsequent versions focused on fitness and sports – the watch was like a <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fitbit</a>&#8211; plus the ability to be annoyed by interruptions from your work. But now the fourth version of the Watch might have just found the beginnings of “gotta have it” killer applications – healthcare – specifically medical diagnostics and screening.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare on Your Wrist<br />
</strong>Large tech companies like Google, Amazon, Apple recognize that the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-<em>trillion</em> dollar</a> <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/top-tech-companies-healthcare-investments-acquisitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health care market is ripe for disruption</a> and have poured billions of dollars into the space. Google has been investing in a broad healthcare portfolio, Amazon has been investing in pharmacy distribution and Apple…? Apple has been focused on turning the Apple Watch into the future of health screening and diagnostics.</p>
<p>Apples latest Watch &#8211; with three new healthcare diagnostics and screening apps &#8211; gives us a glimpse into what the future of healthcare diagnostics and screening could look like.</p>
<p>The first new healthcare app on the Watch is <em>Fall Detection. </em>Perhaps you’ve seen the old commercials where someone <a href="https://youtu.be/cwCtM6D4GOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falls and can’t get up</a>, and has a device that calls for help. Well this is it – built into the watch. The watch’s built-in accelerometer and gyroscope analyze your wrist trajectory and impact acceleration to figure out if you’ve taken a hard fall. You can dismiss the alert, or have it call 911. Or, if you haven’t moved after a minute, it can call emergency services, and send a message along with your location.</p>
<p>If you’re in Apple’s current demographic you might think, “Who cares?” But if you have an aged parent, you might start thinking, “How can I get them to wear this watch?”</p>
<p>The second new healthcare app also uses the existing optical sensor in the watch and running in the background, gathers heart data and has an algorithm that can <em>detect irregular heart rhythms</em>. If it senses something is not right, up pops up an alert. A serious and common type of irregular heart rhythm is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_atrial_fibrillation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atrial fibrillation</a> (AFib). AFib happens when the atria—the top two chambers of the heart get out of sync, and instead of beating at a normal 60 beats a minute it may quiver at 300 beats per minute.<img /><img /><a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png"><img data-attachment-id="24591" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/09/26/the-apple-watch-tipping-point-time-for-healthcare/watch-afib/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png" data-orig-size="595,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Watch Afib" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png?w=468" class="alignright wp-image-24591" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png?w=250&#038;h=126" alt="" width="250" height="126" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png?w=250&amp;h=126 250w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png?w=500&amp;h=252 500w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png?w=150&amp;h=76 150w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-afib.png?w=300&amp;h=151 300w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></p>
<p>This rapid heartbeat allows blood to pool in the heart, which can cause clots to form and travel to the brain, causing a stroke. Between <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_atrial_fibrillation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 and 6.1 million people</a> in the US have AFib (2% of people under 65 have it, while 9% of people over 65 years have it.) It puts <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_atrial_fibrillation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">~750,000</a> people a year in the hospital and contributes to ~<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_atrial_fibrillation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">130,000 deaths each year</a>. But if you catch atrial fibrillation early, there’s an effective treatment — blood thinners.</p>
<p>If your watch gives you an irregular heart rhythm alert you can run the third new healthcare app – the <em>Electrocardiogram.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Electrocardiogram </em>(ECG or EKG) is a visual presentation of whether your heart is working correctly. It records the electrical activity of the heart and shows doctors the rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the chambers of the heart, and any damage to the heart&#8217;s muscle. Today, ECGs are done in a doctor&#8217;s office by having you lie down, and sticking 10 electrodes to your arms, legs and chest. The heart&#8217;s electrical signals are then measured from twelve angles (called &#8220;leads&#8221;).<a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png"><img data-attachment-id="24593" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/09/26/the-apple-watch-tipping-point-time-for-healthcare/watch-ecg/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png" data-orig-size="708,279" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Watch ECG" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png?w=468" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-24593" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png?w=300&#038;h=118" alt="" width="300" height="118" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png?w=300&amp;h=118 300w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png?w=600&amp;h=236 600w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/watch-ecg.png?w=150&amp;h=59 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>With the Apple Watch, you can take an ECG by just putting your finger on the crown for 30 seconds. To make this work Apple has added two electrodes (the equivalent of a single lead), one on the back of the watch and another on the crown. The ECG can tell you that you may have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_atrial_fibrillation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atrial fibrillation</a> (AFib) and suggest you see a doctor. As the ECG is saved in a PDF file (surprisingly it’s not also in the <a href="https://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/FHIR-Fast-Healthcare-Interoperability-Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HL7&#8217;s FHIR Format</a>), you can send it to your doctor, who may decide no visit is necessary.</p>
<p>These two apps, the Electrocardiogram and the irregular heart rhythms, are serious health screening tools. They are supposed to ship in the U.S. by the end of 2018. By the end of next year, they can be on the wrists of tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>The question is are they are going to create millions of unnecessary doctors’ visits from unnecessarily concerned users or are they going to save thousands of lives?  My bet is both – until traditional healthcare catches up with the fact that in the next decade screening devices will be in everyone’s hands (or wrists.)</p>
<p><strong>Apple and The FDA &#8211; </strong><em>Clinical Trials</em><strong><br />
</strong>In the U.S. medical devices, drugs and diagnostics are regulated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food and Drug Administration – the FDA</a>. What’s unique about the Apple Watch is that both the Electrocardiogram and the irregular heart rhythms apps required Apple to get clearance from the FDA. This is a very big deal.</p>
<p>The FDA requires evidence that medical devices do what they claim. To gather that evidence companies enroll volunteers in a study – called a <em>clinical trial</em> – to see if the device does what the company thinks it will.</p>
<p>Stanford University has been running a clinical trial on <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03335800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irregular heart rhythms</a> for Apple since 2017 with a completion date in 2019. The goal is to see if an irregular pulse notification is really atrial fibrillation, and how many of those notified contacted a doctor within 90 days. (The Stanford study appears to be using previous versions of the Apple Watch with just the optical sensor and not the new ECG sensors. They used someone else’s <a href="https://epatch.madebydelta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wearable heart monitor</a> to detect the Afib.)</p>
<p><em>Nov 1 2018 Update &#8211; </em>the design of the Stanford Apple Watch study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870318302710?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published here</a></p>
<p>To get FDA clearance, Apple reportedly <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/09/13/heres-the-data-behind-the-new-apple-watch-ekg-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submitted two studies</a> to the FDA (so far none of the data has been published or peer reviewed). In one trial with 588 people, half of whom were known to have AFib and the other half of whom were healthy, the app couldn’t read 10% of the recordings. But for the other 90%, it was able to identify over 98% of the patients who had AFib, and over 99% of patients that had healthy heart rates.</p>
<p>The second data set Apple sent the FDA was part of Stanford’s <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/appleheartstudy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Heart Study</a>. The app first identified 226 people with an irregular heart rhythm. The goal was to see how well the Apple Watch could pick up an event that looked like atrial fibrillation compared to a <a href="https://epatch.madebydelta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wearable heart monitor</a>. The traditional monitors identified that 41 percent of people had an atrial fibrillation event. In 79 percent of those cases, the Apple app also picked something up.</p>
<p>This was good enough for the FDA.</p>
<p><strong>The FDA &#8211; Running Hard to Keep Up With Disruption</strong><br />
And “good enough” is a big idea for the FDA. In the past the FDA was viewed as inflexible and dogmatic by new companies while <a href="https://www.massdevice.com/netflixs-the-bleeding-edge-blasts-medtech-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viewed as insufficiently protective</a> by watchdog organizations.</p>
<p>For the FDA this announcement was as important for them as it was for Apple.</p>
<p>The FDA has to adjudicate between a whole host of conflicting constituents and priorities. Its purpose is to make sure that drugs, devices, diagnostics, and software products don’t harm thousands or even millions of people so the FDA wants a process to make sure they get it right. This is a continual trade-off between patient safety, good enough data and decision making, and complete clinical proof. On the other hand, for a company, a FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/resourcesforyou/consumers/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearance</a> can be worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. And a disapproval or delayed clearance can put a startup out of business. Finally, the rate of change of innovation for medical devices, diagnostics and digital health has moved faster than the FDA’s ability to adapt its regulatory processes. Frustrated by the FDA’s 20<sup>th </sup>century processes for 21<sup>st </sup>century technology, companies hired lobbyists to force a change in the laws that guide the FDA regulations.</p>
<p>So, the Apple announcement is a visible signal in Washington that the FDA is encouraging innovation. In the last two years the FDA has been trying to prove it could keep up with the rapid advancements in digital health, devices and diagnostics- while trying to prevent another <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blood-testing-firm-theranos-to-dissolve-1536115130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theranos</a>.</p>
<p>Since the appointment of the new <a href="https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/centersoffices/ucm557569.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head of the FDA</a>, there has been very substantial progress in speeding up mobile and digital device clearances with new guidelines and policies. For example, in the last year the FDA announced its <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/digitalhealth/digitalhealthprecertprogram/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-Cert pilot program</a> which allows companies making <a href="https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/SoftwareasaMedicalDevice/ucm20086412.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software as a medical device</a> to build products without each new device undergoing the FDA clearance process. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/DigitalHealthPreCertProgram/UCM611103.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The pilot program</a> allowed <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/apple-fitbit-samsung-and-verily-among-fdas-picks-precertification-pilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine companies</a>, including Apple, to begin developing products (like the Watch) using this regulatory shortcut. (The FDA has also proposed new <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM587819.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rules for clinical support software</a> that say if doctors can review and understand the basis of the software’s decision, the tool does not have to be regulated by the FDA.)</p>
<p>This rapid clearance process as the standard – rather than the exception – is a sea-change for the FDA. It&#8217;s close to de-facto adopting a Lean decision-making process and rapid clearances for things that minimally affect health. It’s how China approaches approvals and will allow U.S. companies to remain competitive in an area (medical devices) where China has declared the intent to dominate.</p>
<p><strong>Did Apple Cut in Front of the Line?<br />
</strong>Some have complained that the FDA has been <a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm620246.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too cozy with Apple</a> over this announcement.</p>
<p>Apple got its two FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm142523.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class II</a> clearances through what’s called a “<a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/DEN180044.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">de novo</a>” pathway, meaning Apple claimed these features were the first of its kind. (It may be the first one built <em>into </em>the watch, but it’s not the first Apple Watch ECG app cleared by the FDA – <u><a href="https://www.alivecor.com/press/press_release/fda-clears-first-medical-device-for-apple-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AliveCor</a></u>, got over-the-counter-clearance in 2014 and <a href="https://www.cardiacdesigns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardiac Designs</a> in 2013.) Critics said that the De Novo process should only be used where <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM404773.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no predicate</a> (substantial equivalence to an already cleared device.) But Apple cited at least one predicate, so if they followed the conventional <a href="https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/ucm134034.htm">510k</a> approval process, that should have taken at least 100 days. Yet Apple got two software clearances in under 30 days, which uncannily appeared the day before their product announcement.</p>
<p>To be fair to Apple, they were likely holding pre-submission meetings with the FDA for quite some time, perhaps years. One could speculate that using the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/digitalhealth/digitalhealthprecertprogram/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-Cert pilot program</a> they consulted on the design of the clinical trial, trial endpoints, conduct, inclusion and exclusion criteria, etc. This is all proper medical device company thinking and exactly how consumer device companies need to approach and work with the FDA to get devices or software cleared. And it&#8217;s exactly how the FDA should be envisioning its future.</p>
<p>Given Apple sells ~15 million Apple Watches a year, the company is about to embark on a public trial at massive scale of these features – with its initial patient population at the least risk for these conditions. It will be interesting to see what happens. Will overly concerned 20- and 30-year-olds flood doctors with false positives? Or will we be reading about lives saved?</p>
<p><strong>Why most consumer hardware companies aren’t medical device and diagnostic companies<br />
</strong>Historically consumer electronics companies and medical device and diagnostic companies were very different companies. In the U.S. medical device and diagnostic products require both <em>regulatory clearance</em> from the FDA and <em>reimbursement </em>approval by different private and public insurers to get paid for the products.</p>
<p>These regulatory and reimbursement agencies have very different timelines and priorities than for-profit companies. Therefore, to get FDA clearance a critical part of a medical device company is spent building a staff and hiring consultants such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_research_organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clinical research organizations</a> who can master and navigate FDA regulations and clinical trials.</p>
<p>And just because a company gets the FDA to clear their device/diagnostic/software doesn’t mean they’ll get paid for it. In the U.S. medical devices are <a href="https://www.meddeviceonline.com/doc/from-approved-to-covered-what-medical-device-companies-need-to-know-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reimbursed</a> by private insurance companies (Blue Cross/Blue Shield, etc.) and/or the U.S. government via Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Getting these clearances to get the product <a href="https://www.namsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NAMSA-Planning-for-Successful-Medical-Device-Reimbursement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered, coded and paid</a> is as hard as getting the FDA clearance, often taking another 2-3 years. Mastering the reimbursement path requires a company to have yet another group of specialists conduct expensive clinical cost outcomes studies.</p>
<p>The Watch announcement telegraphed something interesting about Apple &#8211; they’re one of the few consumer products company to crack the FDA clearance process (<a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philips</a> being the other). And going forward, unless these new apps are a disaster, it opens the door for them to add additional FDA-cleared screening and diagnostic tools to the watch (and by extension a host of AI-driven imaging diagnostics (melanoma detection, etc.) to the iPhone.) This by itself is a key differentiator for the Watch as a healthcare device.</p>
<p>The other interesting observation: Unlike other medical device companies, Apple’s current Watch business model is <u>not </u>dependent on getting insurers to pay for the watch. Today consumers pay directly for the Watch. However, if the Apple Watch becomes a device eligible for <em>reimbursement</em>, there’s a huge revenue upside for Apple<em>. </em>When and if that happens, your insurance would pay for all or part of an Apple Watch as a diagnostic tool.</p>
<p>(After running cost outcome studies, insurers believe that preventative measures like staying fit brings down their overall expense for a variety of conditions. So today some life insurance companies <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/20/john-hancock-life-insurance-apple-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are <em>mandating </em>the use of an activity tracker</a> like Apple Watch.)</p>
<p><strong>The Future of SmartWatches in Healthcare<br />
</strong>Very few companies (probably less than five) have the prowess to integrate sensors, silicon and software with FDA regulatory clearance into a small package like the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>So what else can/will Apple offer on the next versions of the Watch? After looking through Apple’s patents, here’s my take on the list of medical diagnostics and screening apps Apple may add.</p>
<p><em>Sleep Tracking and Sleep Apnea Detection<br />
</em>Compared to the <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/sleep-better">Fitbit</a>, the lack of a sleep tracking app on the Apple Watch is a mystery (though <a href="https://www.cydiageeks.com/best-sleep-tracking-apps-for-apple-watch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party sleep apps</a> are available.) Its absence is surprising as the Watch can theoretically do much more than just sleep tracking – it can <a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4412/presentation/45220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potentially detect Sleep Apnea</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep apnea</a> happens when you’re sleeping, and your upper airway becomes blocked, reducing or completely stopping air to your lungs. This can cause a host of complications including Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, liver problems, snoring, daytime fatigue<strong>. </strong>Today diagnosing sleep apnea often requires an overnight stay in a sleep study clinic<strong>. </strong>Sleep apnea screening doesn’t appear to require any new sensors and would be a great app for the Watch. Perhaps the app is missing because you have to take the watch off and recharge it every night?</p>
<p><em>Pulse oximetry<br />
</em><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pulse-oximetry#readings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pulse oximetry</a> is a test used to measure the oxygen level (oxygen saturation) of the blood. The current Apple Watch can already determine how much oxygen is contained in your blood based on the amount of infrared light it absorbs. But for some reason Apple hasn’t released this feature &#8211; FDA regulations? Inconsistent readings?  Another essential Watch health app that may or may not require any new sensors.</p>
<p><em>Respiration rate<br />
</em>Respiration rate (the number of breaths a person takes per minute) along with blood pressure, heart rate and temperature make up a person’s vital signs. Apple <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/06/apple-invents-an-apple-watch-feature-to-measure-respiration-rate-with-multi-band-plethysmography.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a patent</a> for this watch feature but for some reason hasn’t released it &#8211; FDA regulations?  Inconsistent readings?  Another essential Watch health app that doesn’t appear to require any new sensors.</p>
<p><em>Blood Pressure<br />
</em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About 1/3<sup>rd </sup>of Americans have high blood pressure</a>. High blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. It often has no <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/signs_symptoms.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warning signs or symptoms.</a> Many people do not know they have it and only half of those have it under control. Traditionally measuring blood pressure requires a cuff on the arm and produces a single measurement at a single point in time. We’ve never had the ability to <em>continually monitor </em>a person’s blood pressure under stress or sleep. Apple <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/10/apple-is-developing-watch-technology-to-detect-heart-abnormalities-and-now-blood-pressure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed two patents in 2017</a> to measure blood pressure by holding the watch against your chest. This is tough to do, but it would be another great health app for the Watch that may or may not require any new sensors.</p>
<p><em>Sunburn/UV Detector<br />
</em>Apple has patented a new type of sensor – a <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2018/07/patent-invents-the-ultimate-sunscreen-detector-for-apple-watch-that-will-integrate-a-uv-ir-scanner.html#more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sunscreen detector</a> to let you know what exposed areas of the skin of may be at elevated UV exposure risk. I’m not big on this, but the use of ever more powerful sunscreens has quadrupled, while at the same time, the incidence of skin cancers has also quadrupled, so there may be a market here.</p>
<p><em>Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis and Monitoring<br />
</em><a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parkinson’s Disease</a> is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. It <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28150045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affects 1/% of people over 60</a>. Today, there is no diagnostic test for the disease (i.e. blood test, brain scan or EEG). Instead, doctors look for four signs: tremor, rigidity, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradykinesia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bradykinesia</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akinesia">akinesia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_instability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Postural instability</a>. Today patients have to go to a doctor for tests to rate the severity of their symptoms and keep a diary of their symptoms.</p>
<p>Apple added a new “Movement Disorder API” to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/researchkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResearchKit</a> framework that supports <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-to-get-started-apples-researchkit/how-to/2015/08/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement and tremor</a> detection. It allows an Apple Watch to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6854280/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuously monitor for Parkinson’s disease</a> symptoms; tremors and Dyskinesia, a side-effect of treatments for Parkinson’s that causes fidgeting and swaying motions in patients. Researchers have built a prototype <a href="https://github.com/ResearchKit/mPower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parkinson’s detection app</a> on top of it. It appears that screening for Parkinson’s would not require any new sensors – but likely clinical trials and FDA clearance &#8211; and would be a great app for the Watch.</p>
<p><em>Glucose Monitoring<br />
</em><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0718-diabetes-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than 100 million </a>U.S. adults live with diabetes or prediabetes. If you’re a diabetic, monitoring your blood glucose level is essential to controlling the disease. However, it requires sticking your finger to draw blood multiple times a day. The holy grail of glucose monitoring has been a sensor that can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1021949815000174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detect glucose levels through the skin</a>. This sensor has <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/The%20Pursuit%20of%20Noninvsive%20Glucose,%20Fourth%20Edition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been the graveyard of tons of startups</a> that have crashed and burned pursuing this. Apple has <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/08/23/apple-patent-suggests-work-on-non-invasive-glucose-monitoring-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a patent application</a> that looks suspiciously like a non-invasive glucose monitoring sensor for the Apple Watch. This is a really tough technical problem to solve, and even if the sensor works, there would be a long period of clinical trials for FDA clearance, but this app would be a game changer for diabetic patients &#8211; and Apple &#8211; if they can make it happen.</p>
<p><em>Sensor and Data Challenges<br />
</em>With many of these sensors just getting a signal is easy. Correlating that particular signal to an underlying condition and avoiding being confounded by other factors is what makes achieving medical device claims so hard.</p>
<p>As medical grade data acquisition becomes possible, continuous or real time transmission will store and report baseline data on tens of millions of “healthies” that will be vital in training the algorithms and eventually predicting disease earlier. This will eventually enable more accurate diagnostics on less data, and make the data itself – especially the transition from healthy to diseased – incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>However, this sucks electrons out of batteries and plays on the edge electrical design and the laws of physics, but Apple&#8217;s prowess in this area is close to making this possible.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Not Working?<br />
</strong>Apple has attempted to get medical researchers to create new health apps by developing <a href="http://researchkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResearchKit</a>, an open source framework for researchers. Great idea. However, given the huge potential for the Watch in diagnostics, <a href="https://www.apple.com/researchkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResearchKit</a> and the recruitment of Principal Investigators feels dramatically under resourced. (It took three years to go from ResearchKit 1.0 to 2.0).  Currently, there are just 11 ResearchKit apps on the ITunes store. This effort – Apple software development and third-party app development &#8211; feels understaffed and underfunded. Given the potential size of the opportunity, the rhetoric doesn&#8217;t match the results and the results to date feel off by at least 10x.</p>
<p>Apple needs to act more proactively and directly fund some of these projects with grants to specific principal investigators and <em>build a program of sc</em>ale. (Much like the <a href="https://sbir.nih.gov/statistics/success-stories#successReadMore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH SBIR program</a>.) There should be as sustained commitment to at least several new FDA cleared screening/diagnostic apps every year for Watch and iPhone <em>from Apple</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Future<br />
</strong>Although the current demographics of the Apple Watch skews young, the populations of the U.S., China, Europe and Japan continue to age, which in turn threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems. Having an always on, real-time streaming of medical data to clinicians, will change the current “diagnosis on a single data point and by appointment” paradigm. Wearable healthcare diagnostics and screening apps open an entirely new segment for Apple and will change the shape of healthcare forever.</p>
<p>Imagine a future when you get an Apple Watch (or equivalent) through your insurer to monitor your health for early warning signs of heart attack, stroke, Parkinson’s disease and to help you monitor and manage diabetes, as well as reminding you about medications and tracking your exercise. And when combined with an advanced iPhone with additional FDA cleared screening apps for early detection of skin cancer, glaucoma, cataracts, and other diseases, the future of your health will truly be in your own hands.</p>
<p>Outside the U.S., China is plowing into this with government support, private and public funding, and a <a href="http://eng.sfda.gov.cn/WS03/CL0755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China FDA (CFDA)</a> approval process that favors local Chinese solutions. There are well over 100 companies in China alone focusing in this area, many with substantial financial and technical support.</p>
<p>Let’s hope Apple piles on the missing resources for diagnostics and screening apps and grabs the opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>

<p>For most of our lives the idea that computers and technology would get, better, faster, cheaper every year was as assured as the sun rising every morning. The story “<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-all-7nm-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GlobalFoundries Stops All 7nm Development</a>“ doesn’t sound like the end of that era, but for anyone who uses an electronic device, it most certainly is.</p>
<p>Technology innovation is going to take a different direction.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.globalfoundries.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GlobalFoundries</a> was one of the three companies that made the most advanced silicon chips for other companies (AMD, IBM, Broadcom, Qualcomm, STM and the Department of Defense.) The other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundry_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foundries</a> are <a href="https://www.samsungfoundry.com/foundry/homepage/anonymous/about.do?_mainLayOut=homepageLayout&amp;menuIndex=01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung</a> in South Korea and <a href="http://www.tsmc.com/english/aboutTSMC/company_profile.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSMC</a> in Taiwan. Now there are only two pursuing the leading edge.</p>
<p>This is a big deal.</p>
<p>Since the invention of the integrated circuit ~60 years ago, computer chip manufacturers have been able to pack more transistors onto a single piece of silicon every year. <a href="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="24540" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2018/09/12/the-end-of-more-the-death-of-moores-law/fairchild-micrologic/" data-orig-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg" data-orig-size="914,1226" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="fairchild micrologic" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg?w=224" data-large-file="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg?w=468" class="alignright wp-image-24540" src="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg?w=176&#038;h=235" alt="" width="176" height="235" srcset="https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg?w=176&amp;h=235 176w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg?w=350&amp;h=470 350w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https://steveblank.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/fairchild-micrologic.jpeg?w=224&amp;h=300 224w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" /></a>In 1965, Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, <a href="http://hasler.ece.gatech.edu/Published_papers/Technology_overview/gordon_moore_1965_article.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observed that the number of transistors was doubling every 24 months</a> and would continue to do so. For 40 years the chip industry managed to live up to that prediction. The first integrated circuits in 1960 had ~10 transistors. Today the most complex silicon chips have 10 billion. Think about it. Silicon chips can now hold a <em>billion </em>times more transistors.</p>
<p>But Moore’s Law ended a decade ago. Consumers just didn’t get the memo.</p>
<p><strong>No More Moore &#8211; </strong><strong>The End of Process Technology Innovation</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Chips are actually “printed,” not with a printing press but with lithography, using exotic chemicals and materials in a “fab” (a chip fabrication plant – the factory where chips are produced). Packing more transistors in each generation of chips requires the fab to “shrink” the size of the transistors. The first transistors were printed with lines 80 microns wide. Today Samsung and TSMC are pushing to produce chips with features few dozen nanometers across.That’s about a 2,000-to-1 reduction.</p>
<p>Each new generation of chips that shrinks the line widths requires fabs to invest enormous amounts of money in new chip-making equipment.  While the first fabs cost a few million dollars, current fabs – the ones that push the bleeding edge – are over $10 billion.</p>
<p>And the exploding cost of the fab is not the only issue with packing more transistors on chips. Each shrink of chip line widths requires more complexity. Features have to be precisely placed on exact locations on each layer of a device. At 7 nanometers this requires up to 80 separate mask layers.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='468' height='264' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vK-geBYygXo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=54&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s Law was an observation about process technology and economics. For half a century it drove the aspirations of the semiconductor industry. But the other limitation to packing more transistors onto to a chip is a physical limitation called <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dennard scaling</a></u>– as transistors get smaller, their <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_density" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power density</a></u> stays constant, so that the power use stays in proportion with area. This basic law of physics has created a “Power Wall” – a barrier to clock speed &#8211; that has limited microprocessor frequency to around 4 GHz since 2005. It’s why clock speeds on your microprocessor stopped increasing with leaps and bounds 13 years ago.  And why memory density is not going to increase at the rate we saw a decade ago.</p>
<p>This problem of continuing to shrink transistors is so hard that even Intel, the leader in microprocessors and for decades the gold standard in leading fab technology, <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3031241/intel-delays-10nm-chips-yet-again-as-firm-suffers-yield-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has had problems</a>. Industry observers have suggested that <a href="https://semiaccurate.com/2018/08/02/intel-guts-10nm-to-get-it-out-the-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel has hit several speed bumps</a> on the way to their next generation push to 10- and 7-nanometer designs and now is trailing TSMC and Samsung.</p>
<p>This combination of spiraling fab cost, technology barriers, power density limits and diminishing returns is the reason <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-all-7nm-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GlobalFoundries</a> threw in the towel on further shrinking line widths . It also means the future direction of innovation on silicon is no longer predictable.</p>
<p><strong>It’s the End of the Beginning<br />
</strong>The end of putting more transistors on a single chip doesn’t mean the end of innovation in computers or mobile devices. (To be clear, 1) the bleeding edge will advance, but almost imperceptibly year-to-year and 2) GlobalFoundaries isn&#8217;t shutting down, they&#8217;re just no longer going to be the ones pushing the edge 3) existing fabs can make current generation 14nm chips and their expensive tools have been paid for. Even older fabs at 28-, 45-, and 65nm can make a ton of money).</p>
<p>But what it does mean is that we’re at the end of guaranteed year-to-year growth in computing power. The result is the end of the <em>type of innovation we’ve been used to for the last 60 years. </em>Instead of just faster versions of what we’ve been used to seeing, device designers now need to get more creative with the 10 billion transistors they have to work with.</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that human brains have had 100 billion neurons for at least the last 35,000 years. Yet we’ve learned to do a lot more with the same compute power. The same will hold true with semiconductors &#8211; we’re going to figure out radically new ways to use those 10 billion transistors.</p>
<p>For example, there are <a href="https://semiengineering.com/big-changes-for-mainstream-chip-architectures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new chip architectures</a> coming (multi-core CPUs, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/30/intels-exascale-dataflow-engine-drops-x86-and-von-neuman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massively parallel CPUs</a> and special purpose silicon for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/19/ai-chip-start-ups-graphcore-and-mythic-raising-big-venture-rounds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI/machine learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPU’s </a>like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia</a>), new ways to package the chips and to interconnect memory, and even new types of memory. And other designs are pushing for extreme low power usage and others for very low cost.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a Whole New Game<br />
</strong>So, what does this mean for consumers? First, high performance applications that needed very fast computing locally on your device will continue their move to the cloud (where data centers are measured in football field sizes) further enabled by new <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/345387/what-is-5g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5G networks</a>. Second, while computing devices we buy will not be much faster on today’s off-the-shelf software, new features– facial recognition, augmented reality, autonomous navigation, and apps we haven’t even thought about –are going to come from new software using new technology like new displays and sensors.</p>
<p>The world of computing is moving into new and uncharted territory. For desktop and mobile devices, the need for a “must have” upgrade won’t be for speed, but because there’s a new capability or app.</p>
<p>For chip manufacturers, for the first time in half a century, all rules are off. There will be a new set of winners and losers in this transition. It will be exciting to watch and see what emerges from the fog.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Moore’s Law – the doubling of every two years of how many transistors can fit on a chip &#8211; has ended</li>
<li>Innovation will continue in new computer architectures, chip packaging, interconnects, and memory</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5G networks</a> will move more high-performance consumer computing needs seamlessly to the cloud</li>
<li>New applications and hardware other than CPU speed (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/345387/what-is-5g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5G networks</a>, displays, sensors) will now drive sales of consumer devices</li>
<li>New winners and losers will emerge in consumer devices and chip suppliers</li>
</ul>

<p>Reading the NY Times article “<em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/business/media/katzenberg-streaming-video.html">Jeffrey Katzenberg Raises $1 Billion for Short-Form Video Venture,</a>” </em>I realized it was time for a new startup heuristic: the amount of customer discovery and product-market fit you need to find is inversely proportional to the amount and availability of risk capital.</p>
<p>And while the &#8220;first mover advantage&#8221; was the rallying cry of the last bubble, today&#8217;s is: &#8220;Massive capital infusion can own the entire market.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Fire, Ready, Aim<br />
</strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Katzenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Katzenberg</a> has a great track record – head of the studio at Paramount, chairman of Disney Studios, co-founder of DreamWorks and now chairman of NewTV. The billion dollars he just raised is on top of the $750 million NewTV’s parent company, WndrCo, has raised for the venture. He just hired <a href="https://r-login.wordpress.com/remote-login.php?action=auth&amp;host=variety.com&amp;id=43439658&amp;back=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2018%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Fmeg-whitman-tapped-as-ceo-of-jeffrey-katzenbergs-mobile-content-venture-1202674576%2F&amp;h=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meg Whitman</a>. the ex-CEO of HP and eBay, as CEO of NewTV. Their idea is that consumers will want a subscription service for short form entertainment (10-minute programs) for mobile rather than full length movies. (Think YouTube meets Netflix).</p>
<p>It’s an almost $2-billion-dollar bet based on a set of hypotheses. Will consumers want to watch short-form mobile entertainment? Since NewTV won’t be making the content, they will be licensing from and partnering with traditional entertainment producers. Will these third parties produce something people will watch? NewTV will depend on partners like telcos to distribute the content. (Given Verizon just shut down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go90</a>, its short form content video service, it will be interesting to see if Verizon distributes Katzenberg’s offerings.)</p>
<p>But NewTV doesn’t plan on testing these hypotheses. With fewer than 10 employees but almost $2-billion dollars in the bank, they plan on jumping right in.</p>
<p>It’s the antithesis of the Lean Startup.  And it may work. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dot Com Boom to Bust<br />
</strong>Most entrepreneurs today don’t remember the Dot-Com bubble of 1995 or the Dot-Com crash that followed in 2000. As a reminder, the Dot Com bubble was a five-year period from August 1995 (the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netscape-ipo-ignited-the-boom-taught-some-hard-lessons-20058518550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netscape IPO</a>) when there was a massive wave of experiments on the then-new internet, in commerce, entertainment, nascent social media, and search. When Netscape went public, it unleashed a frenzy from the public markets for anything related to the internet and signaled to venture investors that there were massive returns to be made investing in anything internet related. Almost overnight the floodgates opened, and risk capital was available at scale from venture capital investors who rushed their startups toward public offerings. Tech IPO prices exploded and subsequent trading prices rose to dizzying heights as the stock prices became disconnected from the traditional metrics of revenue and profits. Some have labeled this period as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_exuberance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irrational exuberance</a></em>. But as <a href="http://www.carlotaperez.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlota Perez</a> has so aptly described, all new technology industries go through an eruption and frenzy phase, followed by a crash, then a golden age and maturity. Then the cycle repeats with a new set of technologies.</p>
<p>Given the stock market was buying “the story and vision” of anything internet, inflated expectations were more important than traditional metrics like customers, growth, revenue, or heaven forbid, profits. Startups wrote business plans, generated expansive 5-year forecasts and executed (hired, spent and built) to the plan. The mantra of “<a href="https://steveblank.com/2010/10/04/why-pioneers-are-the-ones-with-the-arrows-in-their-backs/">first mover advantage</a>,” the idea that winners are the ones who are the first entrants in their market, became the conventional wisdom of investors in Silicon Valley.“ First Movers” didn’t understand customer problems or the product features that solved those problems (what we now call product-market fit). These bubble startups were actually guessing at their business model and did premature and aggressive hype and early company launches and had extremely high burn rates – all predicated on an IPO to raise more cash. To be fair, in the 20<sup>th </sup>century, there really wasn’t a model for how to build startups other than write plan, raise money, and execute – the bubble was this method, on steroids. And to be honest, VC&#8217;s in this bubble really didn&#8217;t care. Massive liquidity awaited the first movers to the IPO&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s how they managed their portfolios.</p>
<p>When VC’s realized how eager the public markets were for anything related to the internet, they pushed startups with little revenue and no profits into IPOs as fast as they could. The unprecedented size and scale of VC returns transformed venture capital from a financial asset backwater into full-fledged player in the financial markets.</p>
<p>Then one day it was over. IPOs dried up. Startups with huge burn rates – building leases, staff, PR and advertising &#8211; ran out of money. Most startups born in the bubble died in the bubble.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of the Lean Startup<br />
</strong>After the crash, venture capital was scarce to non-existent. (Most of the funds that started in the late part of the boom would be underwater). Angel investment, which was small to start with, disappeared, and most corporate VCs shut down. VC’s were no longer insisting that startups spend faster, and &#8220;swing for the fences&#8221;. In fact, they were screaming at them to dramatically reduce their burn rates. It was a nuclear winter for startup capital.</p>
<p>The idea of the Lean Startup was built on top of the rubble of the 2000 Dot-Com crash.</p>
<p>With risk capital at a premium and the public markets closed, startups and their investors now needed a methodology to preserve capital and survive long enough to generate revenue and profits. And to do that they needed a different method than just “build it and they will come.” They needed to be sure that what they were building was what customers wanted and needed. And if their initial guesses were wrong, they needed a process that would permit them to change early on in the product development process when the cost of changes was small – the famed “pivot”.</p>
<p>Lean started from the observation that <em>you cannot ask a question that you have no words for</em>. At the time we had no language to describe that startups were not smaller versions of large companies; the first insight was that large companies <em>executed </em>known business models, while startups <em>searched for them. </em>Yet while we had plenty of language and tools for execution, we had none for search.  So we (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989200507/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0989200507&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blank</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898">ies</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470876417?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470876417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Osterwalder</a>) built the tools and created a new language for innovation and modern entrepreneurship. It helped that in the nuclear winter that followed the crash, 2001 &#8211; 2004, startups and VCs were extremely risk averse and amenable to new ideas that reduced risk. (This same <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/10/10/sequoia-capitals-56-slide-powerpoint-presentation-of-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk averse, conserve the cash, VC mindset</a> would return after the 2008 meltdown of the housing market.)</p>
<p>As described in the HBR article “<a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why the Lean Startup Changes Everything</a>,” we developed Lean as the <a href="https://steveblank.com/2010/10/25/entrepreneurship-as-a-science-%E2%80%93-the-business-modelcustomer-development-stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business model / customer development / agile development solution stack</a> where entrepreneurs first map their hypotheses about their business model and then test these hypotheses with customers in the field (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989200507/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0989200507&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customer development</a>) and use an iterative and incremental development methodology (agile development) to build the product. This allowed startups to build Minimal Viable Products (MVPs) &#8211; incremental and iterative prototypes &#8211; and put them in front of a large number of customers to get immediate feedback. When founders discovered their assumptions were wrong, as they inevitably did, the result wasn’t a crisis; it was a learning event called <a href="https://steveblank.com/2010/04/12/why-startups-are-agile-and-opportunistic-%E2%80%93-pivoting-the-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a pivot</a>— and an opportunity to change the business model.</p>
<p>Every startup is in a race against time. It has to find product-market fit before running out of cash. Lean makes sense when capital is scarce and when you need to keep burn rates low. Lean was designed to <i>inform the founders&#8217; vision while they operated frugally at speed. It was not built as a focus group for consensus for those without deep convictions</i>.</p>
<p>The result? Startups now had tools that sped up the search for customers, ensured that what was being built met customer needs, reduced time to market and slashed the cost of development<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Carpe Diem &#8211; Seize the Cash<br />
</strong>Today, memories of frugal VC&#8217;s and tight capital markets have faded, and the structure of risk capital is radically different. The explosion of seed funding means tens of thousands of companies that previously languished in their basement are getting funding, likely two orders of magnitude more than received Series A funding during the Dot-Com bubble. As mobile devices offer a platform of several billion eyeballs, potential customers which were previously small niche markets now include everyone on the planet. And enterprise customers in a race to reconfigure strategies, channels, and offerings to deal with disruption provide a willing market for startup tools and services.</p>
<p>All this is driven by corporate funds, sovereign funds and even VC funds with capital pools of tens of billions of dollars dwarfing any of the dollars in the first Dot Com bubble – and all looking for the next Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, or Alibaba. What matters to investors now is to drive startup valuations into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unicorn territory</a> (valued at $1 billion or more) via rapid growth &#8211; usually users, revenue, engagements but almost never profits. As valuations have long passed the peak of the 2000 Internet bubble, VC&#8217;s and founders who previously had to wait until they sold their company or took it public to make money no longer have to wait. They can now sell part of their investment when they raise the next round. And if the company does go public, the valuations are at least 10x of the last bubble.</p>
<p>With capital chasing the best deals, and hundreds of millions of dollars pouring into some startups, most funds now scoff at the idea of Lean. Rather than the<em> &#8220;first mover advantage&#8221; </em>of the last bubble<em>,</em> today&#8217;s theory is that<em> &#8220;massive capital infusion owns the entire market.&#8221;</em> And Lean for startups seems like some quaint notion of a bygone era.</p>
<p>And that explains why investors are willing to bet on someone with a successful track record like Katzenberg who has a vision of disrupting an entire industry.</p>
<p>In short, Lean was an answer to a specific startup problem at a specific time, <em>one that most entrepreneurs still face and which ebbs and flows depending on capital markets</em>. It’s a response to scarce capital, and when that constraint is loosened, it’s worth considering whether other approaches are superior. With enough cash in the bank, Katzenberg can afford to create content, sign distribution deals, and see if consumers watch. If not, he still has the option to pivot. And if he’s right, the payoff will be huge.</p>
<p><strong>One More Thing&#8230;<br />
</strong>Well-funded startups often have more capital for R&amp;D than the incumbent companies they&#8217;re disrupting. Companies struggle to compete while reconfiguring legacy distribution channels, pricing models and supply chains. And government agencies find themselves being disrupted by adversaries unencumbered by legacy systems, policies and history.  Both companies and government agencies struggle with how to deliver innovation at speed. Ironically, for this new audience that makes the next generation of Lean &#8211; <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-your-innovation-process-should-look-like" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Innovation Pipeline</a> &#8211; more relevant than ever.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When capital for startups is readily available at scale, it makes more sense to go big, fast and make mistakes than it does to search for product/market fit.</li>
<li>The amount of customer discovery and product-market fit you need to do is inversely proportional to the amount and availability of risk capital.</li>
<li>Still, unless your startup has access to large pools of capital or have a brand name like Katzenberg, Lean still makes sense.</li>
<li>Lean is now essential for companies and government agencies to deliver innovation at speed</li>
<li>The Lean Startup isn&#8217;t dead. For companies and government the next generation of Lean &#8211; <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-your-innovation-process-should-look-like" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Innovation Pipeline</a> &#8211; is more relevant than ever.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year I head to the East coast for vacation. We live in a semi-rural area, just ~10,000 people in town, with a potato farm across the street and an arm of the ocean in the backyard. While they own tech, smartphones and computers, most of my neighbors can’t tell you about the latest trends in AI, Bitcoin or Facebook. In contrast, Silicon Valley is an innovation cluster, a monoculture of sorts, with a churning sea of new tech ideas, sailed by entrepreneurs who each passionately believe they&#8217;re the next Facebook or Google, with their sails driven by the hurricane winds of investor capital.</p>
<p>The seas are calm here. Most years out here I spend my time reading. This year has been a bit more interesting. One of the things I did was to speak to the startup community in Providence Rhode Island at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s no handbook on how to evaluate and process “suggestions” and “advice” from a boss or a mentor. But how you choose to act on these recommendations can speed up your learning and make or break your career. Here’s what to keep in mind:</p>
<hr />
<p>I had a team of students working on an arcane customer problem. While they were quickly coming up to speed, I suggested that they talk to someone who I knew was an expert in the area and could help them learn much faster. In fact, starting in the second week of the class, I suggested the same person several times – one-on-one, in class and in writing. Each time the various team members smiled, nodded and said, “Yes, we’ll get right on it.”  Finally, eight weeks later when they were about to fly across the country to meet the customer, I reminded them again.</p>
<p>When they returned from the trip, I asked if the advisor I suggested was helpful.</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised when they replied, “Oh, we’ve been trying to connect with him for a while and he never responded.”  So, I asked:</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Team,<br />
As per our conversation about the lack of response from your advisor John Doe -please forward me copies of the emails you have sent to him.</em></p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Steve</p>
<hr />
<p>The reply I received was disappointing &#8212; but not totally surprising.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Dear Steve, </em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I believe our team has painted the wrong picture due to miscommunication on our part. It was our responsibility to reach out to John Doe, but we failed to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>We did not attempt to reach out to him up until Week 8 before our flight, but the email bounced. We got caught up in work on the trip and did not follow-up. What we should have done was to clarify the email address with our Teaching Assistant and attempt to contact him again.</em></p>
<p><em>Best regards,</em></p>
<p><em>Taylor</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Extra credit for finally owning that they screwed up – but there was more to it.</p>
<p><strong>Combine Outside Advice with Your Own Insights<br />
</strong>Upon reflection I realized that this student team was missing a learning opportunity. They were soon heading for the real world, and they had no idea how to evaluate and process “suggestions” and “advice.”  Ironically, given they were really smart and in a world-class university, they were confusing “smart” with “I can figure it all out by myself.”</p>
<p>Throughout my entrepreneurial career I was constantly bombarded by advice – from bosses, mentors, friends, investors, et al. I was lucky enough to have <a href="https://steveblank.com/2011/04/19/mentors-coaches-and-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentors</a> who took an interest in my career, and as a young entrepreneur, I tried to pay attention to what they were trying to tell me. (Coming into my first startup from four years in the military I didn’t have the advantage of thinking I knew it all.) It made me better – I learned faster than having to acquire every bit of knowledge from scratch and I could combine the data coming from others with the insights I had.</p>
<p><strong>Have a Process to Evaluate Suggestions and Advice<br />
</strong>Here was my response to my student team:</p>
<p>Dear Team:</p>
<p>Throughout your work career you’ll be getting tons of suggestions and advice; from mentors – people you don’t work for but who care about your career and from your direct boss and others up your reporting chain.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Treat advice and suggestions as a gift, </em>not a distraction
<ul>
<li>Assume someone has just given you a package wrapped in a bow with your name on it.</li>
<li>Then think of how they’ll feel when you ignore it and toss it aside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you’re working at full speed just trying to get your job done, it’s pretty easy to assume that advice/suggestions from others are just diversions. That’s a mistake. At times following up on them may make or break a career and/or a relationship.
<ul>
<li>The first time your boss or mentor will assume you were too busy to follow up.</li>
<li>The second time your boss will begin to question your judgment. Your mentor is going to question your willingness to be coached.</li>
<li>The third time you ignore suggestions/advice from your boss is a career-limiting move. And if from a mentor, you’ve likely damaged or ended the relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everyone likes to offer “suggestions” and “advice.” Think of these as falling into four categories:
<ul>
<li>Some bosses/mentors offer “suggestions” and “advice” because it makes them feel important.</li>
<li>Others have a set of contacts or insights they are willing to share with you because they believe these might be useful to you.</li>
<li>A few bosses/mentors have pattern-recognition skills. They’ve recognized the project you’re working on or problem you’re trying to solve could be helped by connecting with a specific person/group or by listening to how it was solved previously.</li>
<li>A very small subset of bosses/mentors has extracted some best practices and/or wisdom from those patterns. These can give you shortcuts to the insights they’ve taken years to learn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early in your career it’s hard to know whether a suggestion/advice is valuable enough to spend time following up. Here’s what I suggest:
<ul>
<li>Start with “Thanks for the suggestion.”</li>
<li>Next, it’s OK to ask, “Help me understand why is this important? Why should I talk to them? What should I learn?” This will help you figure out which category of advice you’re getting.If it’s a direct boss and others up your reporting chain, ask, “How should I prioritize this? Does it require immediate action?” (And it most cases it doesn’t matter what category it’s in, just do it.)</li>
<li>Always report back to whoever offered you the advice/suggestion to share what you learned. Thank them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you open yourself to outside advice, you’ll find people interested in the long-term development of your career – these are your career mentors. Unlike coaching, there’s no specific agenda or goal but mentor relationships can result in a decades-long <a href="https://steveblank.com/2009/06/25/convergent-technologies-war-story-1-%E2%80%93-selling-with-sports-scores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dialog of continual learning</a>. What makes these relationships a mentorship is this: <em>you have to give as good as you are getting</em>. While you’ll be learning from them – and their years of experience and expertise – what you need to give back is equally important – offering fresh insights to their data.</p>
<p>If your goal is to be a founder, having a network of mentors/advisors means that not only will you be up to date on current technology, markets or trends, you’ll be able to recognize patterns and bring new perspectives that might be basis for your next startup.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Suggestions/advice at work are not distractions that can be ignored
<ul>
<li>Understand the type of suggestions/advice you’re getting (noise, contacts, patterns, insights)</li>
<li>Understand why the advice is being given</li>
<li>Agree on the priority in following it up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not understanding how to respond to advice/suggestions can limit your career</li>
<li>Advice is a kickstarter for your own insights and a gateway for mentorship</li>
<li>Treat advice and suggestions as a gift, not a distraction</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just finished our 3rd annual <a href="http://hacking4defense.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Defense class at Stanford</a>. Six teams presented their Lessons Learned presentations.</p>
<p>Watching them I was left with wonder and awe about what they accomplished in 10 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Six teams spoke to over <strong><em>600</em></strong> beneficiaries, stakeholders, requirements writers, program managers, warfighters, legal, security, customers, etc.</li>
<li>By the end the class all of the teams realized that the problem as given by the sponsor had morphed into something bigger, deeper and much more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the six teams presented a 2-minute video to provide context about their problem and then gave an 8-minute presentation of their Lessons Learned over the 10-weeks. Each of their slide presentations follow their customer discovery journey. All the teams used the <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission Model Canvas</a>, Customer Development and Agile Engineering to build Minimal Viable Products, but all of their journeys were unique.</p>
<p>The teams presented in front of several hundred people in person and online.</p>

<p><strong>The Class<br />
</strong>Our mantra to the students was that we wanted them to learn about “Deployment not Demos.” Our observation is that the DOD has more technology demos than they need, but often lack deep problem understanding.  Our goal was to have the students first deeply understand their sponsors problem – <em>before</em> they started building solutions. As you can imagine with a roomful of technologists this was tough. Further we wanted the students to understand <u>all</u> parts of the <a href="https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mission model canvas</a>, not just the beneficiaries and the value proposition. We wanted them to learn what it takes to get their product/service <em>deployed</em> to the field, not give yet another demo to a general. This meant that the minimal viable products the students built were focused on maximizing their learning of what to build, not just building prototypes.</p>
<p>(Our sponsors did remind us, that at times getting a solution deployed meant that someone did have to see a demo!)</p>
<p>Note: The Hacking for Defense class was designed as “fundamental research” to be shared broadly and the results are not subject to restriction for proprietary or national security reasons. In the 10 weeks the students have, Hacking for Defense hardware and software prototypes don’t advance beyond a Technology Readiness Level 4 and remain outside the scope of US export control regulations and restrictions on foreign national participation.</p>
<p><strong>Goals for the Hacking for Defense Class<br />
</strong>Our primary goal was to teach students Lean Innovation while they engaged in a national public service. Today if college students want to give back to their country they think of <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teach for America</a>, the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peace Corps</a>, or <a href="http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americorps</a> or perhaps the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/united-states-digital-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Digital Service</a> or the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSA’s 18F</a>. Few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community or other government agencies.</p>
<p>Next, we wanted the students to learn about the nation’s threats and security challenges while working with innovators inside the DoD and Intelligence Community. While doing so, also teach our sponsors (the innovators inside the Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community (IC)) that there is a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats. That if we could get teams to <em>rapidly</em> discover the real problems in the field using Lean methods, and <em>only then</em> articulate the requirements to solve them, could defense acquisition programs operate at <em>speed and urgency</em> and deliver <em>timely</em> <em>and needed </em>solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to familiarize students about the military as a profession, its expertise, and its proper role in society. And conversely show our sponsors in the Department of Defense and Intelligence community that civilian students can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and rapid prototyping of solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<p><strong>Origins of the class<br />
</strong>Hacking for Defense has its origins in the Lean LaunchPad class I first taught at Stanford in 2011. It was adopted by the National Science Foundation in 2012 to train Principal Investigators who wanted to get a federal grant for commercializing their science (an SBIR grant.) The NSF observed, &#8220;The class is the scientific method for entrepreneurship. Scientists understand hypothesis testing&#8221; and relabeled the class as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSF I-Corps</a> (Innovation Corps). The class is now taught in 81 universities and has trained over 1500 science teams. It was adopted by the National Institutes of Health as<a href="https://sbir.cancer.gov/programseducation/icorps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> I-Corps at NIH</a> in 2014 and at the National Security Agency in 2015.</p>

Wondering how we could get students engaged, we realized the same Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps class would provide a framework to do so. Both <a href="http://hacking4defense.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Defense</a> and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande298/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Diplomacy</a> with the State Department were born. <a href="http://www.hacking4energy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Energy</a> at Columbia, <a href="http://hacking4impact.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Impact</a> (Non-Profits) at Berkeley and <a href="http://usbcsd.org/duke-2017-agenda/2017/1/11/making-markets-and-moving-markets-organization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacking for Conservation and Development</a> at Duke quickly followed.</p>

<p><strong>The Innovation Insurgency Spreads<br />
</strong><a href="http://hacking4defense.stanford.edu/">Hacking for Defense</a> is now offered at eleven universities in addition to Stanford – <a href="http://www.hacking4defensegu.com/#welcome">Georgetown</a>, <a href="https://steveblank.com/www.engineering.pitt.edu/hacking4defense">University of Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="https://cid.boisestate.edu/venturecollege/hacking-for-defense/">Boise State</a>, <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/hackingfordefense/">UC San Diego,</a> James Madison University, <a href="http://hacking4defense.st.usm.edu/">University of Southern Mississippi</a>, University of Southern California and Columbia University. Over the next year it will expand to 22 universities. <a href="http://www.h4di.org/">Hacking for Defense.org</a> a non-profit, was established to train educators and to provide a single point of contact for connecting the DOD/IC sponsor problems to these universities.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been surprised was how applicable the “Hacking for X…” methodology is for other problems. It&#8217;s equally applicable to solving public safety, energy, policy, community and social issues internationally and within our own communities. In the next year we&#8217;ll see three new variants of the class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacking for the Environment</li>
<li>Hacking for Oceans</li>
<li>Hacking for Cities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It Takes a Village<br />
