				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for August 1st, 2019. Wow, is it already August? The summer is heading into its tail-end now, but you&#8217;d never know it by the temperatures outside. Today, we&#8217;ve got a couple of news tidbits to go along with the summaries of today&#8217;s many new releases. Add in the latest sales and that&#8217;s pretty much the lot, friends. It seems like Nintendo has a new bonus cooking for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, and the news may indeed be out by the time this gets posted, but since we&#8217;re still waiting for details as I write this it&#8217;ll have to wait for tomorrow&#8217;s article.</p>
<h3><strong>News</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&#8216;LEGO Jurassic World&#8217; Comes to Switch September 17th</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Another game from a few years back is going to be making its way to Switch soon. TT Games has announced that<em> LEGO Jurassic World</em> will be launching on Switch on September 17th, just in time for the Switch Lite launch. This game covers the first four <em>Jurassic Park</em> movies, so that recent one that everyone has already forgotten about isn&#8217;t covered here. But you do get all three of the DLC packs that were previously sold separately right out of the proverbial box, so I guess that&#8217;s something. This was a pretty well-liked game back when it first hit in 2015, so it makes sense to bring it to Switch. I just hope this means there&#8217;s a chance the other <em>LEGO Marvel</em> games may one day make the jump.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Portal Knights&#8217; Expansion &#8216;Elves, Rogues, and Rifts&#8217; Out Now</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Okay, so there are two bits to this. First, there is a new paid expansion DLC for <em>Portal Knights</em> called <em>Elves, Rogues, and Rifts</em>. It includes a new race, a new class, and some new dungeons, along with a couple of new locations filled with quests. The other bit is a free update called the<em> Questing Update</em>. It adds a new location, a dungeon creation features, a quest log, and a bunch of little fixes, performance improvements, and so on. So whether you want to spend money or not, today is win-win for <em>Portal Knights</em> players. The new expansion DLC costs $9.99 and should be available in the eShop at this very moment. If it&#8217;s not, blame Carter. He has nothing to do with any of this, but you know, for old times&#8217; sake.</p>
<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Chroma Squad ($14.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256371" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chromasquad.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chromasquad.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chromasquad-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chromasquad-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chromasquad-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, chances are good that your tactical strategy RPG needs are being nicely met at the moment thanks to<em> Fire Emblem</em> and <em>Mutant Year Zero</em>, but do either of those games have <em>Power Rangers</em>? <em>Chroma Squad</em> isn&#8217;t a perfect game by any means, but it&#8217;s an amazing love letter to <em>Super Sentai</em> shows that has solid gameplay backing it up. Kit out and power up your superhero team as they try to hit the top of the ratings charts. Just be careful of the budget, because money doesn&#8217;t grow on trees. I especially love the teamwork moves in this game. They really drive home the feeling of the shows <em>Chroma Squad</em> pays homage to. Toss in a weird sense of humor and you have something that is both unique and good.</p>
<h3><strong>Dungeon Warfare ($9.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256372" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dungeonwarfare.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dungeonwarfare.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dungeonwarfare-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dungeonwarfare-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dungeonwarfare-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p>
<p>Ah, I love this game. This one has been out on mobile and PC for a while, and in fact its sequel came out a little while back already. I&#8217;d imagine that will eventually make its way to the Switch as well, for but for now we&#8217;ve got the fantastic original game to enjoy. As a dungeon lord, you&#8217;ve got ninety-nine problems, and most of them have names like Arthur Couragehart or Rizzlin the Sorcerer. Yes, adventurers are constantly invading your home and trying to steal all your stuff. You&#8217;ll have to use all the traps, monsters, and natural defenses at your disposal to dispose of the intruders. You&#8217;ll gain experience for do so, and more and more devious options will be open to you. Sure, we&#8217;ve all played at least one or two games like this before, but this is a really good take on the idea. I&#8217;ll be doing a review of this one eventually for those who want more details.</p>
<h3><strong>Robbie Swifthand and the Orb of Mysteries ($17.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256373" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/robbieswifthand.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/robbieswifthand.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/robbieswifthand-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/robbieswifthand-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/robbieswifthand-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p>
<p>This platformer is (A) super-tough and (B) super-fun. Play as Robbie Swifthand, an unlikely hero tasked with saving humanity. Well, he&#8217;ll do it, but only because there could be money in it. And when you see how often the poor guy dies a horrible death, you&#8217;ll probably understand why he wants some reasonable compensation. The game includes three difficulty levels, so you can always bump it down to Not So Hard if you&#8217;re struggling with the standard difficulty. As long as you don&#8217;t mind games that lean a bit into the realm of unfair, you&#8217;ll probably have a good time swearing and cursing your way through <em>Robbie Swifthand</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>Shinobi Spirits S: Legend of Heroes ($8.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256374" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shinobispiritsslegendofheroes.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shinobispiritsslegendofheroes.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shinobispiritsslegendofheroes-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shinobispiritsslegendofheroes-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shinobispiritsslegendofheroes-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>From Tom Create comes this single-player arena brawler where you play as a little ninja animal who needs to fight off the Tokugawa ninjas in order to find out what happened to General Yukimura Sanada and the Beast Brigade. It seems pretty fun, with lots of moves and combo opportunities, and you can power up your character using a skill tree to open up more. It seems like it could get a little repetitive after a while, but Tom Create has surprised me before so I&#8217;m open to being surprised again. I&#8217;ll definitely need to spend more time with this one to see if it&#8217;s noteworthy, but if it turns out to be interesting, I&#8217;ll let you all know.</p>
<h3><strong>Omega Labyrinth Life ($59.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256375" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/omegalabyrinthlife2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/omegalabyrinthlife2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/omegalabyrinthlife2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/omegalabyrinthlife2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/omegalabyrinthlife2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><em>Welp</em>, there&#8217;s no way to explain this without diving right into it, so let&#8217;s just do it. This is a roguelike game where you play as young girls who are unhappy about the size of their chests and therefore venture into the Omega Labyrinth, where every enemy slain grants Omega Power that increases your character&#8217;s bust size. Sadly, it&#8217;s just a temporary boost, but those who complete the dungeon may find a more permanent solution. The girls identify mysterious objects by putting them between their boobs and giving them a good rub, and you need to be mindful that you don&#8217;t slip in any stray puddles of lube. Also, there&#8217;s some gardening. If nothing else, it&#8217;s not shy about its concept, but it <em>should</em> be shy about that price. As Japanese-style roguelikes go, this is about as middle-of-the-road as you can get in terms of quality.</p>
<h3><strong>Illusion of L&#8217;Phalcia ($12.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256376" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/illusionoflphalcia.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/illusionoflphalcia.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/illusionoflphalcia-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/illusionoflphalcia-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/illusionoflphalcia-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>When I reviewed the mobile version of this almost five years ago, at about two-thirds the price, I said this: &#8220;It’s a story you’ve seen a million times before with characters you’ve seen a million times before in a world you’ve seen a million times before." I didn&#8217;t <em>hate</em> the game at the time, but then again, I had only played about twenty Kemco RPGs at that point. Here, now, and on the Switch, there&#8217;s really no reason to buy most of these incredibly average RPGs, especially at an increased price. Like, throw in seven dollars more and you can buy<em> Disgaea 5</em> right now.</p>
<h3><strong>Fobia ($9.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256377" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fobia.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fobia.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fobia-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fobia-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fobia-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>A moody, minimalistic puzzle-platformer where the main character&#8217;s journey serves as an allegory for their psychological issues. Haven&#8217;t had one of those in a few days. The presentation is interesting and there are two different endings, so you&#8217;ll have a reason to play it at least twice. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s okay. Personally, I&#8217;m kind of burnt out on this sort of game so it takes something really special to grab me, and <em>Fobia</em> just didn&#8217;t pull it off. If you go in for these and are less jaded than I am, you&#8217;ll probably enjoy it well enough.</p>
<h3><strong>Sudoku Relax 2 Summer Waves ($5.00)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256378" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sudokurelax2summerwaves.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sudokurelax2summerwaves.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sudokurelax2summerwaves-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sudokurelax2summerwaves-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sudokurelax2summerwaves-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>If you played <em>Sudoku Relax</em>, this is more of that. More than 300 new puzzles, to be precise. If you <em>didn&#8217;t</em> play <em>Sudoku Relax</em> but have played any <em>Sudoku</em> ever, that&#8217;s pretty much what you get here. Touch controls, a relaxing presentation, and plenty of content to keep you busy for a while. And if you&#8217;ve <em>never</em> played any <em>Sudoku</em>, please go look it up on Wikipedia or something. It&#8217;s a logic puzzle with numbers. Those that like it, like it a lot. Maybe you will be one of those people. It will cost you five dollars to find out, if you do it through this game.</p>
<h3><strong>STANDBY ($4.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256379" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/standby.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/standby.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/standby-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/standby-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/standby-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>This is a slick little platform game with an EDM soundtrack and lots of bold colors. There are 54 levels to play through, and your repertoire of moves includes sliding, dashing, teleporting, shooting, and more. Lots of interesting ideas are introduced along the way so that it stays fresh all the way through. It&#8217;s a very fast and demanding game, and sometimes the controls aren&#8217;t quite where you might like them to be to overcome that challenge. I think if you enjoy games like<em> N+</em>, you <em>might</em> get into what <em>STANDBY</em> is slinging. I think its price is about where it ought to be, if nothing else.</p>
<h3><strong>Hamsterdam ($9.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256380" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hamsterdam.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hamsterdam.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hamsterdam-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hamsterdam-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hamsterdam-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><em>Hamsterdam</em> is a game that is part rhythm game, part fighter. You play as a hamster who knows a powerful and deadly martial art known far and wide as Hamster-Fu. Yeah, it&#8217;s like that. Really cute and stylish presentation on this one, and it&#8217;s certainly fun to bash around on. Without spending more time with it, I can&#8217;t say much about its staying power, but if you&#8217;re looking for a hamster-based fighting game I can&#8217;t see anything better coming out today on Switch. This is the same developer that made the rather good <em>Guns of Icarus Online</em>, so if nothing else, it&#8217;s coming from folks who know how to make a decent game. On the other hand, it also launched on mobile this week at less than a third of the price of this Switch version, so choose wisely.</p>
<h3><strong>Solo: Islands of the Heart ($19.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256381" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soloislandsoftheheart.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soloislandsoftheheart.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soloislandsoftheheart-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soloislandsoftheheart-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soloislandsoftheheart-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>Well, this is a quirky little game. It&#8217;s about love, and also about box puzzles. The box puzzles are okay. You&#8217;ll fight the camera a bit and they&#8217;re sort of open-ended puzzles, which may not appeal to everyone. But you&#8217;ll also have to answer a lot of questions about love, some of them very intimate. The game will sometimes seemingly shame you about your answers all for the sake of, it says, removing your doubts. I can see what it&#8217;s going for, but I could definitely spot the person behind the question a little too often, and it feels like it somewhat spoils the game&#8217;s apparent goal. I could see someone really going in for this game, but I think it&#8217;s just going to bug a lot of people, and its rather iffy technical performance on the Switch doesn&#8217;t do it any favors.</p>
<h3><strong>Arcade Archives Victory Road ($7.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256382" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arcadearchivesvictoryroad.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arcadearchivesvictoryroad.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arcadearchivesvictoryroad-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/arcadearchivesvictoryroad-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>The sequel to<em> Ikari Warriors</em> went in a bit of an odd direction. After battling in a very <em>Rambo</em>-esque setting against some very <em>Rambo</em>-esque bad guys, Ralf and Clark next take on&#8230; extra-dimensional monsters? Sometimes when you stare too long into the Hollywood abyss, the Hollywood abyss stares back at you, friends. But it&#8217;s a fun game, especially if you have a friend to join along with you. Hamster has done its usual good job here, leaving me with just one real thing to advise you about. Namely, this game is included in the<em> SNK 40th Anniversary Collection</em> that is currently on sale for $27.99. That set also includes 24 other games, plus home versions where applicable. So I&#8217;d advise looking at a list of what&#8217;s in that collection and seeing if there are at least three other games that interest you besides<em> Victory Road</em>. If so, that&#8217;s definitely the better value. If not, well&#8230; <em>Arcade Archives</em> it is.</p>
<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3>
<p>There are probably more sales on the way, but even what we have so far at the time of writing isn&#8217;t too shabby. That price on <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> is incredible, for example. I&#8217;ll also call attention to the discount on <em>OTTTD</em>. It&#8217;s not quite as intuitive to play on the Switch as it is on mobile, but it&#8217;s still a great game and that price is superb. The outbox has little to be excited about in it, so feel free to save your money for other purchases if nothing catches your eye.</p>

I hope you&#8217;ll all stop by tomorrow, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="app-icon" href="/games/sega-heroes-puzzle-rpg-quest" style="float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;"><img style="border-radius:20px;" src="https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1394276018/100x100bb.jpg" alt=""/></a>The most recent additions to the <em>SEGA Heroes</em> <a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1394276018?mt=8">(Free)</a> character roster have focused on SEGA&#8217;s post-Genesis era properties, bringing in popular favorites from <em>House of the Dead</em>, <em>Valkyria Chronicles</em>, and <em>Shenmue</em>. Those eras aren&#8217;t generally mined as often as certain other periods in the company&#8217;s history, so I was certainly happy to see those characters show up. But sooner or later, things had to come back to SEGA&#8217;s most popular console, and they <em>really</em> brought it back around for the game&#8217;s latest update.</p>
<p>The Werewolf Centurion from the arcade hit and Genesis pack-in <em>Altered Beast</em> is the newest character to join the puzzle-RPG. He&#8217;s an Epic Red Striker with some interesting tricks up his&#8230; well, I was going to say &#8216;sleeves&#8217;, but the man is only wearing underpants. So some interesting tricks up his loincloth? That sounds moderately illegal, but I can only work with what I&#8217;m given here. You&#8217;ll need fifty character shards to unlock him. Said shards can be unlocked through the latest event chest, or by playing the Rise From Your Grave event that kicks off today.</p>

<p>Werewolf Centurion starts off each battle in human form. His MAX Skill in human form is a Punch that deals straight physical damage. His Star Skill in human form, Spirit Orb, will transform him into Werewolf form, where he gains new skills and a beef-up to his stats. Finally, his Passive Skill in human form is Champion of Zeus, which causes him to generate a Red Star tile at the beginning of every turn provided one doesn&#8217;t already exist. It also grants him Growth and restores some of his health when he transforms.</p>
<p>In Werewolf form, Centurion is an utter monster. His MAX Skill is Flame Arrow, which deals elemental damage and creates a full row of elemental sword tiles that will damage the enemy for three turns. His Star Skill, Fireball Fling, deals elemental damage and inflicts Sap status on the enemy. His Passive Skill in Werewolf form is Feral Fury, which pumps up the damage on all of his matches and replaces any matched or destroyed friendly sword tile with a random three-turn elemental sword tile. Yes, by using his skills properly, you could have near-perpetual sword tiles. Yikes.</p>

<p>The scary thing is, he&#8217;s probably the weakest character we can expect from the <em>Altered Beast</em> roster. It&#8217;s not hard to guess at what the other three characters will probably be. The original game had dragon, bear, and weretiger transformations, and I&#8217;d be awfully surprised if those aren&#8217;t the exact characters we&#8217;ll be getting in the coming weeks. I wonder which one will be the Legendary character? I guess we&#8217;ll know soon. Good luck trying to score the Werewolf Centurion in the meantime!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Earlier today, Playdigious who brought us some great games on mobile announced plans to expand their reach from mobile to PC and consoles as well. To go alongside this announcement, Playdigious revealed four games that are currently planned for the next few months including one on mobile. <em>The Almost Gone</em> from <a href="https://www.happyvolcano.com/">Happy Volcano</a> and Joost Vandecasteele is arriving on Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile platforms. The diorama like adventure game looks gorgeous. Watch the announcement trailer for <em>The Almost Gone</em> below:</p>

</div>
</p>
<p>Your aim in <em>The Almost Gone</em> is to find the truth that led to you being trapped in between life and death. You play as a young girl exploring her surroundings and trying to put together the story through various objects and memories you uncover. The game takes you to your home and much more while looking for the truth. <em>The Almost Gone</em> is full of gorgeous dioramas going by the video and screenshots and is split up into five chapters. I love the look of the game so far.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256393" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FEDBB209-4A0D-44EA-9A60-F32BEE52E241.jpeg" alt="" width="4096" height="2304" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FEDBB209-4A0D-44EA-9A60-F32BEE52E241.jpeg 4096w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FEDBB209-4A0D-44EA-9A60-F32BEE52E241-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FEDBB209-4A0D-44EA-9A60-F32BEE52E241-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FEDBB209-4A0D-44EA-9A60-F32BEE52E241-1024x576.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in <em>The Almost Gone</em>, you can also wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1115780/The_Almost_Gone/">here</a>. This happens to be the first game from Playdigious on Steam. Playdigious is one of my favourite publishers on mobile so I hope they continue to bring more games to mobile in addition to PC and consoles. <em>The Almost Gone</em> is absolutely the kind of game I would play on iOS or Switch though. Check out the official website <a href="https://playdigious.com/the-almost-gone">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="app-icon" href="/games/fortnite" style="float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;"><img style="border-radius:20px;" src="https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1261357853/100x100bb.jpg" alt=""/></a> <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1261357853?mt=8">(Free)</a> patch 10.00 has finally begun rolling out on all platforms. This patch brings Season X dubbed &#8216;Out of Time&#8217; to the Battle Royale phenomenon and unlike the earlier updates, this patch is larger than usual across all platforms as confirmed by Epic Games. The highlights of this update include the B.R.U.T.E. mech suit, the new Battle Pass, and Rift Zones. Watch the Season X story trailer for <em>Fortnite</em> below:</p>
<p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

</div>
</p>
<p>The B.R.U.T.E. mech suit is a two person vehicle. One player controls its movement while the other controls its firepower. You can also operate this solo but it will take some effort switching between moving and firing. Rift Zones have caused locations that were previously lost to re-appear thanks to the Zero Point Explosion. Epic Games has improved performance on all platforms with this update. For iOS and Android, the auto fire system has been improved for every weapon. Controller enthusiasts will now be able to search and interact for controllers through a new addition with patch 10.00. Android devices with sensor pressure settings now have an alert to ensure players don&#8217;t go to the home screen by mistake. Various UI adjustments and fixes have also been made here including an increase in certain button sizes and placements. For Creative, the Advanced Storm Controller and Advanced Storm Beacon have been added to control the Battle Royale 1-0 wave storm.</p>

<p><em>Digimon ReArise</em> is free to play and will have in app purchases. The story here begins with the Digimon &#8216;Herissmon&#8217; appearing in your phone that leads to an attack. Bandai Namco Entertainment calls this a &#8216;Friendship Digivolving RPG&#8217;. It will feature real time battles supporting up to 5v5. You will also be able to play with other Tamers together taking on powerful <em>Digimon</em> in Clash Battles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="app-icon" href="/games/hyper-light-drifter" style="float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;"><img style="border-radius:20px;" src="https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1453875289/100x100bb.jpg" alt=""/></a> I&#8217;m still surprised and glad that Abylight Studios brought the fantastic <em><a href="https://toucharcade.com/2019/06/26/hyper-light-drifter-iphone-ipad/">Hyper Light Drifter</a></em> <a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1453875289?mt=8">(&#36;4.99)</a> to iOS devices. If you haven&#8217;t played it yet, <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> is stunning and one of the best premium games on iOS so far. I already enjoyed it on other platforms but it is great to have a full fledged release with all the Nintendo Switch extras on iOS.</p>
<p>

</div>
</p>
<p><a href="https://toucharcade.com/2019/07/25/hyper-light-drifter-iphone-review/">When I reviewed it</a>, I mentioned how I wished it had iCloud save support because games like this aren&#8217;t really something you can finish in a single sitting. Thankfully Abylight Studios has confirmed that iCloud save support will be arriving in the next update. One other interesting mention is that controller support will allow for more than just MFi controllers with iOS 13. This is a bit vague because people on the iOS 13 beta can already use PS4 and Xbox One controllers but I hope Abylight Studios will update the game with controller button prompts for those controllers when iOS 13 ships and the update is released.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256345" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/08DD2D65-D0AF-41B8-AFD7-74BDC33FD5DD.png" alt="" width="1334" height="750" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/08DD2D65-D0AF-41B8-AFD7-74BDC33FD5DD.png 1334w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/08DD2D65-D0AF-41B8-AFD7-74BDC33FD5DD-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/08DD2D65-D0AF-41B8-AFD7-74BDC33FD5DD-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/08DD2D65-D0AF-41B8-AFD7-74BDC33FD5DD-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wanted something that feels like the best of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery</em> blended in with a lot more, <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> is for you. We featured it as our <a href="https://toucharcade.com/2019/07/26/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-hyper-light-drifter/">Game of the Week</a> as well. It is also priced brilliantly compared to the other console and PC versions and still has the launch discount which brings it to just $4.99 right now. Have you played it on iOS or any other platform yet?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each and every day new mobile games are hitting the App Store, and so each week we put together a big old list of all the best new releases of the past seven days. Back in the day the App Store would showcase the same games for a week, and then refresh those features each Thursday. Because of that developers got into the habit of releasing their games throughout Wednesday or very early Thursday in order to hopefully get one of those coveted features spots. Nowadays the App Store refreshes constantly, so the need for everyone to release all on the same day has diminished. Still, we’ve kept our weekly Wednesday night format as for years that’s the time people knew to check TouchArcade for the list of new games. And so without further ado please check out the full list of this week’s new games below, and let us know in the comments section which games you’ll be picking up!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way back in early 2016 we <a href="https://toucharcade.com/2016/02/03/exiles-of-embermark-announced/">first learned about</a> <em>Exiles of Embermark</em>, an ambitious mobile-centric combat RPG. Originally announced as a project from Industrial Toys, the makers of the <em>Midnight Star</em> series of mobile first-person shooters, the developers actually spun out into a brand new studio called Gunslinger which better represented what they were trying to accomplish with <em>Exiles of Embermark</em>: A game where you can have meaningful and strategic duels with real-life opponents, all in the span of a minute or two that fits into the style of bite-sized mobile gaming. Literally like digital gunslingers. Since that initial announcement more than three years ago, we&#8217;ve <a href="https://toucharcade.com/tag/exiles-of-embermark">covered <em>Exiles of Embermark</em> a ton</a>, posting new info when it came out and seeing the game in various stages of development at conferences. It always felt like the game was right there at the finish line, but with Gunslinger always adding in new features and systems and then trying to balance everything to be fun, that finish line always seemed to be moving further and further into the future. And, well, unfortunately that has finally caught up with them as today they&#8217;ve <a href="https://exilesofembermark.tumblr.com/post/186678855964/the-future-of-exiles">announced</a> that &#8220;the game’s production is currently on ice."</p>
<p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HddXGpQ5Zhk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>So, what does that mean? Well, the short answer is that they just flat out ran out of money to keep development going. They had previously scaled up their staff and expanded the scope of the game, but when some expected financial funding didn&#8217;t come through, they reached the end of their rope pretty quickly. Unfortunately that means that the entire Gunslinger staff save for the two co-founders has been laid off, and currently <em>Exiles of Embermark</em> development is on hold. The game is roughly 75% complete, and if there are any sugar daddy types out there, Gunslinger would love for a financial backer to appear on the scene to help them with funding to finish up and release the game. If that describes you, you can find out more details and contact information <a href="https://exilesofembermark.tumblr.com/post/186678855964/the-future-of-exiles">on the <em>Exiles of Embermark</em> tumblr</a>. </p>
<p>If a money angel doesn&#8217;t swoop in and save the game though? Well, Gunslinger still wants to finish the game by self-funding it. One of the ways they&#8217;re hoping to do that is with the revenue from a brand new game called <em>Dungeoning</em> which they&#8217;ve just publicly announced today. This will be an incremental game that breaks down the upgrade hooks and loot collection of dungeon crawlers and RPGs and stuffs it into a mobile-friendly clicker. But calling it just a clicker doesn&#8217;t do <em>Dungeoning</em> justice as there appear to be some pretty deep systems in play here. </p>
<p><a href="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1500x500.jpeg"><img src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1500x500.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256300" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1500x500.jpeg 1500w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1500x500-300x100.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1500x500-768x256.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1500x500-1024x341.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></a></p>
<p>You can see some very early mockup screens as well as find out how to take part in a very early alpha test over at <a href="https://godungeoning.tumblr.com">the <em>Dungeoning</em> tumblr page</a>, or you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/ckHY5uy">their new Discord server</a> or check out <a href="https://twitter.com/dungeoning">the game&#8217;s Twitter page</a> to keep up with its progress. I&#8217;m very sad to see <em>Exiles of Embermark</em> on hiatus as I love what I&#8217;ve seen of it over the years and I know an amazing game is in there somewhere, but I&#8217;m confident we haven&#8217;t heard the last of it and in the meantime I&#8217;m really excited to see what this <em>Dungeoning</em> game ends up being all about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Developer Legal Radiation, who <a href="https://toucharcade.com/2016/08/30/line-defense-now-available/">released</a> the super clever &#8220;<em>Breakout</em> meets <em>Missile Command</em>" game <em>Line Defense</em> <a href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1059443303?mt=8">(Free)</a> a few years back, have another game on the horizon that&#8217;s looking quite cool. It&#8217;s called <em>Kazarma</em> and it&#8217;s sort of a scrolling shoot &#8217;em up mixed with a third-person auto-runner. And, like <em>Line Defense</em>, it has really colorful and stylish visuals. In fact I&#8217;m kind of in love with the super saturated environments in <em>Kazarma</em>. The concept is pretty simple: Touch and drag your finger or thumb to maneuver your ship left or right as it propels forward and auto-fires at approaching enemies. You&#8217;ll make your way through 50 randomly generated levels that get increasingly more difficult as you progress, with increased speed, more obstacles, and harder enemies. You&#8217;ll collect power-ups, unlock new ships, and even unlock a special Challenge Mode along the way. Here&#8217;s a trailer.</p>
<p>

</div>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, <em>Kazarma</em> takes place on the Kazarma Bridge, which is a real bridge in Greece that dates back to around the 13th century BC. While not <em>quite</em> as long as the Kazarma Bridge in the game, the actual Kazarma Bridge is still standing and in use today, all these centuries later. It&#8217;s pretty remarkable, and a pretty cool inspiration for a video game. I&#8217;m a fan of what Legal Radiation has done in the past, and <em>Kazarma</em> looks like the sort of mobile game I always enjoy – Something you can play with one hand and dip in and out of on a whim. Following a brief beta test that took place <a href="https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/ios-beta-kazarma-shooter-runner-by-legal-radiation.399401/">in our forums</a>, <em>Kazarma</em> should be arriving by the end of August.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for July 31st, 2019. I managed to spend half of my birthday sick in bed, but I got<a href="https://twitter.com/ShaunMusgrave/status/1156152568109662208"> a sweet birthday cake</a> from my wife and some nice <em>Spider-Man</em> loot, so it&#8217;s hard to be upset. In today&#8217;s article, we&#8217;ve got a review of the recent shoot-em-up release <em>Pawarumi</em>, summaries of today&#8217;s trio of new releases, some tasty news bits, and a bunch of cool sales to dig into. Let&#8217;s roll into it!</p>
<h3><strong>News</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&#8216;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&#8217; Now Features the Hero from &#8216;Dragon Quest&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I actually got a prediction right for once! Praise me! Anyway, you probably already saw this, but during yesterday&#8217;s<em> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> video presentation about the latest DLC character, players were treated to the news that the Hero from<em> Dragon Quest</em> would be dropping later that day. That means he&#8217;s available right now! There are other <em>Dragon Quest</em>-related items that have been added to the game alongside him, like new Mii Fighter costumes and such. If you already have the Fighters Pass, you can go ahead and get him. He&#8217;s also going to be available<em> a la carte</em> for $5.99, just like Joker.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled&#8217; Adds New Content and Wumpa Coin Microtransactions</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Ha ha ha, who didn&#8217;t see this one coming? Oh well. So the next Grand Prix is upon us in <em>Crash Team Racing</em>, and it&#8217;s called Back N. Time. The new track is the Prehistoric Playground and it has dinosaurs and other cool stuff. New items include a couple of new karts, a Fake Crash skin, and some Cave Painting stickers. A new character, Baby T., is the Bronze Tier prize, and a Fake Baby T. skin is the final item in the Gold Tier. Baby Crash and Baby Coco are new characters available in the Pit Stop, because apparently Sonic is the only mascot not willing to debase himself in that way. Geez, you&#8217;re really going to need some Wumpa Coins to get all this neat stuff, right? Guess you&#8217;ll have to grind them up just like everyone else? Or wait, because starting in early August, you can just buy Wumpa Coins for real money. Don&#8217;t worry friends, the kind people at Activision are assuring us all that these microtransactions will not have an effect on the core mechanics! But we&#8217;re all quite familiar with this kind of thing from our mobile gaming experience here, so we know what to do with that, right?</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Turok 2: Seeds of Evil&#8217; Remaster Hits the Switch August 9th</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256248" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turok2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turok2.jpg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turok2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turok2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/turok2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>We already knew this was coming sooner or later, but an eShop listing has finally given us the date for the remaster of the classic Nintendo 64 title <em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em>. It&#8217;s more first-person dinosaur shooting action with wild weapons like the Cerebral Bore, and you can even ride a Triceratops. You won&#8217;t need a RAM Expansion to play this hot action game in high resolution this time around! Oh wow, that could totally be on the box or something. Better counter-balance with some cynicism. Um, it&#8217;s missing the multiplayer component from the original game, which is where a good bit of the fun came from in the first place? <em>Ah</em>, fair and balanced.</p>
<p><strong>Sci-Fi RPG &#8216;The Outer Worlds&#8217; Will Be Coming to Switch</strong></p>
<p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

</p>
<p>Gee, Obsidian was really going all-in on the Switch before they were acquired by Microsoft. I wonder if that will continue? Anyway, <em>The Outer Worlds</em> will be coming to Switch sometime after its release on other platforms this October. It&#8217;s a sci-fi RPG directed by the creators of the Fallout series, and it looks pretty fancy if you ask me. The port is being handled by Virtuos, who were behind the Switch versions of<em> L.A. Noire</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>,<em> Starlink</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD</em> among others, so it&#8217;s probably in safe hands. Unfortunately, we have no information about a specific release date outside of the fact that it will certainly be after the others. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s another feather in the Switch&#8217;s lovely RPG cap.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker&#8217; is Now Compatible with the Labo VR Kit</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s hard to guess what Nintendo&#8217;s long term plans are for the Labo VR Kit in light of the Switch Lite&#8217;s lack of compatibility with it, it seems there are at least a few things in the works for it. One just sort of popped out of thin air today, in fact.<em> Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> is a natural fit for the extra 3D perspective that the Labo VR brings to the table, so it&#8217;s nice to see it getting an update like this. You&#8217;ll be able to play four different courses in VR, and there are a couple of other little things to play with using the Kit as well. It&#8217;s a free update, so go on and grab it now if you own the necessary stuff to make use of it.</p>
<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Pawarumi ($14.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-255939" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>Yesterday, I was reading something I wrote on my little side blog a couple of years ago. In that entry, I remarked about how the Nintendo 3DS didn&#8217;t really have a ton of good shoot-em-ups, so even a decent one would be very welcome. A quick look around the Switch eShop shows just how much can change from one console generation to the next, because Nintendo&#8217;s current system is absolutely drowning in excellent examples of the genre. Whether you&#8217;re looking for classics or new games, you&#8217;ve got plenty of choices on the Switch.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether that&#8217;s a good or bad thing for a game like <em>Pawarumi</em>. On the one hand, shoot-em-up fans who like to play on the go probably have a Switch and are likely on the lookout for good games in the genre, and <em>Pawarumi</em> is certainly one of them. On the other hand, there&#8217;s so much absolutely top-tier stuff that it might hard for something that is &#8220;merely" good to get noticed. I hope <em>Pawarumi</em> finds an audience on the Switch, because for whatever I think of its nuts and bolts, I can feel the sheer passion coursing through its veins at every turn. This is a shoot-em-up that was clearly made by fans of shoot-em-ups, and it&#8217;s obvious they have seriously done their homework in putting together something solid in almost every respect.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256249" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi2.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>The clear source of inspiration here is Treasure&#8217;s legendary title <em>Ikaruga</em>, which dazzled players with its unique color-switching gameplay mechanic. <em>Pawarumi</em> also uses a color-switching mechanic, but implements it in a slightly different way. You have three different weapons at your disposal at all times: a blue laser, a green gatling gun, and red missiles. Enemies conveniently come in those three colors as well. There&#8217;s a triangle at play here, and knowing when and how to manipulate it is the key to excelling at the game.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, matching your weapon color to the enemy does a Boost attack. This will refill your health gauge as your fire upon your foes, and that&#8217;s very important because once that health gauge is empty, that&#8217;s the end of the game. No extra lives, no continues. It&#8217;s critical to keep that health gauge topped up. Better still if you don&#8217;t get hit, however. You also have what is called a Crush attack. Each color is weak to one other color and strong to another. Use the right color and you&#8217;ll deal double damage. Finally, you have a super-bomb attack that also uses a meter. You can refill that meter by reversing the Crush order to drain the enemies.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256250" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi3.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi3.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi3-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi3-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pawarumi3-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>Keeping these sorted takes some time, as it&#8217;s not nearly as natural a thing as black beats white or white beats black. The game helps you out by putting indicators at the bottom of the screen, but it can be fatal to look away from the action, so it&#8217;s best just to memorize them as soon as you can. Of course, nothing says you have to. Any weapon will damage any enemy for the most part, and you should be able to pull yourself through the first difficulty level at the very least relying mostly on Boost attacks. But you&#8217;re not going to reach those high scores without taking full advantage of this system, and it will aid you greatly in your goal to beat the game&#8217;s other two difficulty settings.</p>
<p>The easy course has you run through four stages, while you get the full five-stage course on the other two difficulty levels. The order of the stages is switched around on the hardest mode, which if nothing else nicely demonstrates the way the difficulty curve works in <em>Pawarumi</em>. The challenge picks up within each stage, but for the most part one is just as tough as the next. The final stage is the exception, I suppose. You won&#8217;t get to see it if you only play on easy mode, though. And there are no extra options for turning on unlimited continues or more lives here, so you&#8217;ll really have to do it on your own. Once you&#8217;ve finished all three difficulty levels, all that&#8217;s really left is to go for the score attack. The game has online leaderboards and the scoring system is robust enough to make that a fun proposition, though.</p>

<p>The game is a nice visual tour, as well. It reminds me of some of the earlier polygonal shoot-em-ups we saw in the mid- to late-90s, albeit better-looking than most of those. The art style is great, drawing on ancient Columbian culture and filtering it through a sci-fi lens. There&#8217;s a lot of visual variety in the stages, and it uses dramatic camera angles at the start and end of each stage in a way that sort of reminded me of <em>Panzer Dragoon</em>. The only fly in the ointment is that the game is locked at 30 FPS. Apparently the game could run at 60 FPS in some places but it couldn&#8217;t hold it all the way through, and the developers prioritized consistency. It may be updated later if they can figure it out, but honestly, it doesn&#8217;t look or play badly at all. If you&#8217;re used the PC version the timing is the slightest bit different, but at least in my opinion, it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;re <em>not</em> the sort that goes in for score attacking, I&#8217;m not sure how strongly I could recommend <em>Pawarumi</em>. It is a lovely game and it&#8217;s fun while it lasts, but like most shoot-em-ups, it&#8217;s not very long if you&#8217;re just trying to get through it. There are no extras to unlock, and there aren&#8217;t any assists if you&#8217;re struggling, either. The game wants you to learn how to play it properly, and I can respect that. But if you&#8217;re used to Switch shoot-em-ups that let you credit feed to the end, you&#8217;re probably going to bounce off this game hard. The three-color system is neat, but it&#8217;s also a bit non-intuitive until you learn it to the point of reflex.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re familiar with the score attack dance and don&#8217;t mind a game that won&#8217;t offer much of a hand to help you up, there&#8217;s a lot to like about <em>Pawarumi</em>. It pays homage without copying, it&#8217;s absolutely gorgeous at times, and the weapon system is clever and enjoyable once you&#8217;ve got it down. the bosses are interesting, with a couple of them being downright novel in how they ask you to use your weapons. On the whole, it&#8217;s a good, well-constructed shoot-em-up that would be quite welcome in the library of any fan of the genre. I&#8217;d <em>probably</em> recommend it on other platforms before the Switch, but if portability means more to you than 60 FPS, you won&#8217;t be sad with what you get here at all.</p>

<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p>
<p>This is a digital version of a reasonably well-liked board game. It offers a single-player campaign and AI opponents for you to battle against, or you can head online and play with up to three other real humans in cross-platform multiplayer. Anyway, this a worker placement game, and if you&#8217;ve played<em> Lords of Waterdeep</em>, you&#8217;ll find this somewhat familiar in broad strokes. Build up resources, raid other players, rinse and repeat. Do it all up in a viking theme and you&#8217;re about where you need to be. It&#8217;s good stuff, though as always with this sort of thing you&#8217;ll really need to be into the multiplayer to get your full money&#8217;s worth out of it.</p>
<h3><strong>Bear With Me: The Lost Robots ($4.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256254" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bearwithme.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bearwithme.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bearwithme-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bearwithme-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bearwithme-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><em>Bear With Me</em> is a point-and-click adventure game series with a noir setting and a teddy bear detective. His name is Ted E. Bear. Yeah. Well, I promise the humor gets a <em>little</em> better than that. <em>The Lost Robots</em> is a prequel chapter that actually released after the other chapters, but it&#8217;s the core of the set on the Switch. The original chapters, known as <em>The Complete Collection</em>, are apparently available as DLC for this game. Anyway, expect lots of silliness and banter, along with some decent but not spectacular puzzles to solve. Some of those puzzles make very little sense, but I imagine if you&#8217;re into this genre enough to go digging, that&#8217;s not something you&#8217;re unfamiliar with. It&#8217;s decent but even though this adventure technically takes place before the others, you&#8217;re probably better off taking the chapters in the order they were released in. There is a demo for this one, so you can give it a try before you commit to spending your fiver if you want.</p>
<h3><strong>The Tower of Beatrice ($5.99)</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-256255" src="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thetowerofbeatrice.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thetowerofbeatrice.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thetowerofbeatrice-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thetowerofbeatrice-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thetowerofbeatrice-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>This is an adventure game that kind of leans on the whole room escape/hidden object line of design. The puzzles are a bit on the easy side, and it&#8217;s a pretty breezy experience on the whole. Maybe a couple of hours long if you sit down and really go for it. But for six dollars, I suppose that&#8217;s reasonable enough. The graphics are decent, the humor works, and the puzzles are logical enough that they aren&#8217;t annoying. Probably not something that is going to stick with you very long after you finish it, but it&#8217;s a nice little romp for a quiet evening or something like that.</p>
<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s Wednesday. We&#8217;re probably going to get a bunch of new sales coming in after I&#8217;ve gone home for the day, but here&#8217;s what we have for now. Honestly, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d strongly recommend any of these except <em>Morphies Law</em>. Well, that&#8217;s alright sometimes. Do check the outbox, as a lot of great games like <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, <em>Kero Blaster</em>, and <em>Chasm</em> are finishing up their discounts. Some of these games may not come around for this cheap for a while, so have a careful look before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for today, friends. Tomorrow will see more than ten new games hitting the eShop, including <em>Chroma Squad</em>, <em>Omega Labyrinth Life</em>, <em>STANDBY</em>, and others. We&#8217;ll probably also have some news and more than a few sales to look at, so it should be a good one all-around. I hope you&#8217;ll join me tomorrow, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>
