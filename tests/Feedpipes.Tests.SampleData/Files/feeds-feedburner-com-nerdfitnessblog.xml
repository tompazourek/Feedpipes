<h2><a name="benefits_of_handstand"></a>Are Handstands Good for You? (3 Reasons Why Handstands Rule)</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616366" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-as-yoda.jpg" alt="Jim pretending like he's Luke doing a handstand." width="760" height="482" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-as-yoda.jpg 760w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-as-yoda-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-as-yoda-713x452.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-as-yoda-600x381.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p><b>At Nerd Fitness we LOVE handstands like Eleven loves waffles.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615669 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/waffles.gif" alt="Eleven is determined to start doing handstands. But she needs to get her grub on first. " width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><b>Here are 3 reasons why handstands rule:</b></p>
<p><strong><b>#1) </b>Like other <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bodyweight training</a>, there’s no excuse.</strong> If you have room to stand up, you have room to practice handstands.</p>
<p><strong><b>#2) </b>It recruits DOZENS of muscles in your body.</strong></p>
<p>From arm strength to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-wrist-mobility-and-grip-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrist mobility</a> to core strength to shoulder mobility and muscular endurance, handstands do it all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615677" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-1.gif" alt="Rebel Leader Steve showing you how to kick up to a handstand." width="322" height="181" /></p>
<p>When you are trying to balance, it makes your body work as one complete unit.</p>
<p><strong><b>#3) </b>It scares you &#8211; yes, that’s a positive.</strong> We grow outside our comfort zone and for many people, just the thought of a handstand is enough to make their palms sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy, vomi…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615671" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/eight-mile.gif" alt="Whether you have to perform in a rap battle or do a handstand, confidence is key." width="275" height="256" /></p>
<p>&#8230;nevermind.</p>
<p>The point is that the handstand is just as much of a mental challenge as it is a physical one.</p>
<p>How scared do you think this guy gets on a regular basis?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3616399 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-chair-handstand.jpg" alt="Whatever you do, don't try a handstand like this your first time. Or maybe ever..." width="720" height="538" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-chair-handstand.jpg 720w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-chair-handstand-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-chair-handstand-713x533.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jim-chair-handstand-600x448.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s Coach </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master of the NF Fitness Universe, and our lead trainer for our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/rings-and-handstands-superpack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Handstands Course</a> and </span><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nerd Fitness Coaching</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’ll be seeing a lot of him in today’s article because Jim can do handstands in his sleep.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p>
<h2><a name="secret_of_handstand"></a>The Secret to Performing a Handstand</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3616408 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/egg-hammer.jpg" alt="The hardest thing about handstands is actually the mental component. " width="1280" height="957" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/egg-hammer.jpg 1280w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/egg-hammer-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/egg-hammer-768x574.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/egg-hammer-713x533.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/egg-hammer-600x449.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p><strong>Sure, we need to build strength to support ourselves upside-down, but even that hurdle is overblown.</strong></p>
<p>A proper handstand actually starts to feel <em>easy. </em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s because once you&#8217;re balanced and aligned, it becomes uber efficient. Just as you don’t exert yourself much if you stand straight with good posture, a good efficient handstand is the same way… it will soon start to feel effortless.</p>
<p><strong>Actually, the biggest hurdle to overcome &#8211; especially at the beginning &#8211; is the mental fear.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615683" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/stranger-things-scared.gif" alt="Don't be scared of handstands. It's not like anything spooky from ST." width="375" height="211" /></p>
<p>The voice/feeling in the back of your head that says “you could get hurt doing this!” SCARY!</p>
<p>And I won’t sugar-coat things, you CAN hurt yourself working on these skills… but it’s no different than if you walked into the gym first day, slapped 315 lbs on the bench press and gave it a go.</p>
<p>Or went out and tried to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/running-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run 13 miles</a> without training.</p>
<p>The exercise itself isn’t dangerous, unless you attempt TOO much, too quickly.</p>
<p>If you wouldn’t load up a bar to deadlift 500 lbs on your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-gym-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first day in the gym</a>, why do so many people just kick and fling themselves up into a handstand, failing repeatedly, hoping one day they’ll “get” it?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615694" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dont-do-that.gif" alt="Don't try to do a handstand your first day practicing! Work up and progress as directed by this guide." width="289" height="273" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a smarter way!</p>
<p><strong>How do we overcome this fear and keep ourselves safe?</strong> Just like learning any other fitness skill: slow, easy, successful steps!</p>
<p>These small victories accumulate over time to bring us to our goals safely while having a lot of fun.</p>
<p><em>Are you ready to learn?</em></p>

<p><strong>For any handstand exercise, there is going to be a significant amount of stress on the hands and wrists.</strong> So, it’s important you stretch and warm things up.</p>
<p id="video">Here is a video from our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/rings-and-handstands-superpack/">NF Handstands course</a> going over some of our favorite wrist stretches to prepare to get upside-down. Go through each stretch about 10 times.</p>
<p><iframe title="Handstand Progression: Wrist Mobility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mv9KUpHvIcM?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Let’s spotlight a few of these Handstand Warm-Up exercises:</b></p>
<p><b>Forward and Back Wrist Stretch:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615698" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/q-rock.gif" alt="Rocking can help gain wrist strength, critical for doing handstands." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><b>Lifted</b><b> Palms Wrist Stretch: </b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615699" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-wrist-stretch-2.gif" alt="Simply lift your palm off the ground for this stretch." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><b>Reverse Palm Stretch:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615700" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-wrist-stretch-3.gif" alt="Reverse your palms like so for this handstand stretch." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><b>Backhand Palm Stretch:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615703" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wrist-stretch-5.gif" alt="Do this stretch with your backhand facing the ground." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><strong>Upside Down Wrist Stretch:</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615702 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-wrist-stretch-4.gif" alt="Another stretch for your handstand progression." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick with wrist stretches is to move as many different ways as feels comfortable. Feel free to make the warm-up your own!</span></p>
<p><strong>The shoulders are another stressed area in the handstand.</strong> There are several ways we can prepare them for work</p>
<p>A few rounds of jumping jacks:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3584801" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/jumping-jacks-bodyweight-exercise.gif" alt="Jumping Jacks are a great cardiovascular bodyweight exercise" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>Or arm circles</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615711" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arm-circiles.gif" alt="Arm circles are a great way to warm-up for your handstand!" width="483" height="272" /></p>
<p>That will get the blood moving and the area ready.</p>
<p><b>From here, we’ll begin our journey leveling up your Handstand Progression.</b></p>
<p><b>W</b><b>e’ll start by having you work with some balance drills and some positional drills.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing too crazy, and in fact some of these might seem TOO EASY. That’s fine! That’s what we want, remember?</span></p>
<p><b>We’re using small victories to motivate us.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Landing on your head </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is not a great way to motivate anyone.</span></p>

<h2><a name="handstand_progression_level_1"></a>Level 1 Handstand Progression: Quadruped Rocking</h2>
<p><iframe title="Handstand Progression: Quadruped Rocking" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5vygZz5Q6U?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You may be thinking that feeling the balance of a handstand is going to be brutally difficult.</strong></p>
<p>Not so!</p>
<p>We can start quite easily on our hands and knees in the quadruped position.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615780" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/q-rock-1.gif" alt="Steve showing you how to do quadruped rocking, a great workout for doing a handstand." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p>From here, we will simply rock forwards and backwards on our hands.</p>
<p>Seem familiar?</p>
<p>If you did the wrist mobility we described above, it’s the same motion!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615698" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/q-rock.gif" alt="Rocking can help gain wrist strength, critical for doing handstands." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p>Isn’t that handy?<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>As you are rocking back and forth, feel where the weight rests in your hands.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you rock back, it sits more in the heel of your hands. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you rock forward, you’ll feel it in your knuckles and fingertips.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do we want it in the handstand?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Right around the knuckles</span>.</p>
<p>This is a balanced spot &#8211; similar to the balance you find when standing. You don’t sit all your weight on your heels, and you don’t lean all your weight forward, gripping your toes hard into the ground, do you?</p>
<p>Find and feel that balance when you rock.</p>
<p><b>When should you move on to Level 2 Handstand Progression? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now would work!</span></p>
<h2><b><a name="handstand_progression_level_2"></a>Level 2 Handstand Progression: Hollow Body</b></h2>
<p><iframe title="Handstand Progression: Hollow Body" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/85QpXmKFVm4?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The hollow body is one of the best ways to engage the midsection and stabilize the body.</strong> It will help to give your handstand a good shape.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615795" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-3.png" alt="The hollow body is a great exercise to practice doing a handstand." width="506" height="246" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-3.png 506w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-3-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></p>
<p>Do you need to master the hollow body to master the handstand?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, as there are plenty of handstands out there that are a bit banana-shaped.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615796" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-banana.jpg" alt="The one and only Jim doing a banana shaped handstand" width="457" height="249" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-banana.jpg 2566w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-banana-300x163.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-banana-768x418.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-banana-713x388.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-banana-600x326.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></p>
<p>But the hollow body will help you create a more efficient position.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>#1)</strong> Start by laying down a yoga or exercise mat on the ground and laying on the ground face up.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615798" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-1.png" alt="Start by lying on your back like so." width="645" height="254" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-1.png 645w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-1-300x118.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-1-600x236.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>#2)</strong> Think about pressing your lower back down into the ground and engaging your midsection like you’re coughing. You should still be able to breath!</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>#3)</strong> Once the midsection is set, tuck your knees to your chest and hold your shins like you’re getting ready for a wicked cannonball.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615799" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-2.png" alt="Grab your legs like you are doing a cannonball.

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>#4)</strong> Holding the shins will help you maintain that lower back and midsection position.</span></p>
<p><b>Still feeling good?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then try rocking!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615800" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-1.gif" alt="Try rocking your hollow body once you get comfortable." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rock your body forward and back slightly from the upper back to the lower back, like a rocking chair. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head and feet stay off the ground. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are stable then you should move as one unit.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need more of a challenge, reach your arms by your ears, keep the knees tucked, and rock some more. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615802" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollow-body-2.gif" alt="Extending your arms will up the difficulty of this handstand workout." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the hands holding the shins, the midsection really has to keep engaged in order to give you a smooth rock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With any of these positions, work to rock for a full 15 seconds under control. </span></p>
<p><b>Once you can do so with arms extended, progress up to Level 3.</b></p>

<h2><b><a name="handstand_progression_level_4"></a>Level 4 Handstand Progression: Wall Walk</b></h2>
<p><iframe title="Handstand Progression: Wall Walk" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz5LT7DRneQ?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>In this level, we’ll get started working toward something that actually looks like a handstand!</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615817" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wall-walk-1.gif" alt="The wall walk will help you build strength for a handstand. Be careful here." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p>All we’re trying to do with this exercise is support our bodyweight on our straightened arms (just like the front plank or <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/proper-push-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">push-up</a>).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615818" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plank.png" alt="You'll start a wall walk by first getting comfortable in a plank position." width="590" height="330" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plank.png 880w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plank-300x168.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plank-768x429.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plank-713x399.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/plank-600x335.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p><strong>So, the first level of this exercise is to simply get yourself up into the top of a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/proper-push-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">push-up</a> and hold.</strong> If that’s too hard, put your hands up on an elevated surface and/or rest on your knees and hands instead.</p>
<p><em>Once this is mastered, level up by simply lifting your hips in the air into a down dog position!</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615820" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/downward-dog.png" alt="Before getting on the wall for our handstand, we'll do a downward dog." width="414" height="222" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/downward-dog.png 414w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/downward-dog-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></p>
<p>From here, it’ll be a matter of getting your feet onto a higher and higher surface. Note: putting your feet up something even a few inches off the floor counts &#8211; small steps!</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use something as simple as bumper plates:</span></i></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3615822" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bumper-plates.png" alt="Bumper plates can help you raise your feet for handstand prep." width="323" height="312" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bumper-plates.png 732w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bumper-plates-300x290.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bumper-plates-620x600.png 620w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bumper-plates-600x580.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></p>
<p>As you progress, add more bumper plates (or whatever you’re using) so your feet are higher and higher.</p>
<p><strong>Once you are supporting yourself with your feet on a high box, try walking your feet up the wall. (Think of it like a really tall box!)</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615823" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wall-walk-2.gif" alt="Steve doing a wall walk as part of his handstand progression workout." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><strong>Be careful at this step:</strong> Be sure you have enough energy to walk back down safely and second, that you don’t walk too close to the wall and risk flipping onto your back!</p>
<p>See the <a href="#handstand_progression_level_5">next section on pirouettes</a> to safely exit these wall walks if you happen to &#8220;go over!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>With each of these variations, we’re looking to build up to a solid 15 seconds under control before moving forward.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;re at the point of lying vertically against the wall, you’re on your way to leveling up to a full handstand! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, we need to talk about how to bail safely.</span></p>
<h2><a name="handstand_progression_level_5"></a>Level 5 Handstand Progression: How to Bail out of a Handstand</h2>
<p><iframe title="Handstand Progression: How to Bail out of a Handstand" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VE48-o6Gy-E?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>As you start to get better with Wall Walks, and you practice getting closer and closer to completely vertical while upside down, there&#8217;s going to be instances where you start to &#8220;tip over.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>In order to safely return your feet to the ground, you&#8217;re going to want to do what we call a pirouette:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615834" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-bail-1.gif" alt="It's very critical you practice this bail as you progress in your handstand work." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><b>How to bail out of a handstand:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Get into a wall handstand.</li>
<li>Shift your weight to one arm (the planted arm), allowing the other arm to move.</li>
<li>Drive one leg into the wall (the one that’s on the same side as the planted arm), and lean the opposite leg forward.</li>
<li>Gravity pulls you around, and lets you lower your feet to the floor safely.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616287" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-bail-2.gif" alt="Steve showing you the &quot;pirouette&quot; so you can bail out of your handstand safely." width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><strong>This is one of the most important skills you can learn as you develop your handstand practice,</strong> as it will allow you to safely exit any handstand without any risk of injury as you develop your balance!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you feel comfortable bailing out of a handstand, my dear rebel, <a href="#handstand_progression_level_6">it is time for Level 6</a>!</span></p>
<h2><b><a name="handstand_progression_level_6"></a>Level 6 Handstand Progression: How to Do a Handstand</b></h2>

<p><b>We are now ready for you to try a handstand!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s going to come down to you slowly but surely leaving the safety of the wall.</span></p>
<p><b>First, just try to take one leg off the wall during your wall walk:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616300" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-one-leg.gif" alt="Lifting one leg during a wall walk is how we'll start our full handstand. " width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><b>When you’re comfortable taking one leg off, trying switching them!</b></p>

<p><b>The objective is now is to switch your legs in a slow, smooth manner</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – one lifts off the wall while the other simultaneously moves back to the wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you get comfortable with this, it’s time to take both legs off the wall!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616308" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand.gif" alt="When you have both legs off the wall, you are doing a handstand! Woot!" width="398" height="224" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BOOM! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your first handstand</span>!</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you doing it right? </span></em></p>

<p><strong>Nothing beats patience and hard work, but there are a few tips and tricks we can provide that will allow you the best chance for success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>#1) Make sure you go through a <a href="#handstand_warm_up">proper warm-up</a>:</strong> We’ve given you several options for the wrists and shoulders. Not only will a warm-up help prevent injury, but it will get the muscles and joints properly prepared to get the most out of your training.</p>
<p><strong>#2) Prioritize Your Handstand:</strong> You can work the skill on its own time, and it won’t interfere or be interfered by anything else, but what if you’re doing other exercises during your workout?</p>
<p>When do you handstand, when you&#8217;re training in a swamp?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616309" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/luke-handstand.gif" alt="Luke rocks one arm handstand, but he also has the force. And yoda. " width="540" height="229" /></p>
<p><b>The best time to work the balancing drills (<a href="#handstand_progression_level_4">like your wall walk</a>) is at the beginning of your workout, after you’ve warmed up.</b></p>
<p>These skills require concentration and a fresh focus to really benefit and progress with them.</p>
<p>Trying to balance after you’ve exhausted yourself with a tough cardio session is an exercise in futility (pun intended).</p>
<p><strong>The best time to work the positional drills (<a href="#handstand_progression_level_1">like your quadruped rock</a>) would be sometime during your strength session, and before your cardio.</strong></p>
<p>These drills are not as dependent on completely fresh muscles, but we still don’t want to try and hold ourselves upside-down after a grueling workout.</p>
<p><strong>#3) Don&#8217;t do too much, too soon.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve mentioned this a million times because it’s so important. Taking on too much too soon is a way to develop bad habits and possibly injure yourself.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616314" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-accident-1.gif" alt="Don't go too quickly or you may end of bashing your head against the wall." width="220" height="393" /></p>
<p>Take your time! Enjoy and really master each step!</p>
<p><strong>#4) Take it Easy:</strong> In the same vein, we want to look for success.</p>
<p>What do I usually see when people practice handstands: Someone kicking up 100 times and kinda getting a handstand once or twice. How much sense does that make?</p>
<p>While we might not be batting 1,000 with all our attempts, but we should be looking to successfully complete around 8 out of 10 attempts. If we’re not? Then we might have taken on too much, too soon!</p>
<p><b>Let’s wrap up this guide and give you some next steps for your handstand practice. </b></p>
<h2>The 5-Minute Rule: Practice Handstands Every Day and Be Amazed at What Happens</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616373" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-sunset.jpg" alt="Now you know how to progress into a full handstand!!!" width="1920" height="772" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-sunset.jpg 1920w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-sunset-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-sunset-768x309.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-sunset-713x287.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/handstand-sunset-600x241.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p><strong>Commit to 5 minutes a day. That’s it. But do it every day.</strong></p>
<p>I’ll see a lot of people go all in for a single handstand session, and then not touch the skill for a week or more.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Gable once said, “If it’s important, do it every day.” </strong></p>
<p>Now this is a simplification, but with handstands, this is ESPECIALLY important.</p>
<p>When you first start out, your arms and shoulder may only be able to do 5 minutes before they are DONE.</p>
<p>Doing them for a short time each day is the best strategy to improve strength, endurance, and balance.</p>

<h2><a name="why_bodyweight_workout"></a>The Benefits of BodyWeight Workout Circuits (They Kick ass)</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3576035" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/army-LEGO-push-ups-713x400.jpg" alt="These LEGO characters love to stay fit doing the beginner bodyweight workout" width="713" height="400" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/army-LEGO-push-ups.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/army-LEGO-push-ups-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/army-LEGO-push-ups-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>What makes bodyweight circuits work so well? </strong></p>
<p>Every bodyweight exercise involved utilizes multiple muscle groups, gets your heart rate pumping, and burns tons of calories.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3583748" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/push-up.gif" alt="This gif shows Staci doing a push-up in perfect form." width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>Essentially, <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/circuit-training-build-some-muscles-burn-some-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuit weight training</a>, or circuit bodyweight training, burns more calories than interval training, and that in turn burns WAY more calories than steady cardio.</p>
<p><strong>When you <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength train</a>, you burn calories.</strong></p>
<p>Then, your body needs to spend hours and hours afterward rebuilding your muscles, which in turn burns even more calories (they call this the &#8220;afterburn&#8221; effect).</p>
<p><strong>As we cover in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/">Coaching Program</a> and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/">the NF Academy</a>, our nutrition will account for 80-90% of our success or failure when it comes to getting in shape, might as well spend our time exercising being efficient and strong, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Want to make better food decisions?</strong> Read our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Healthy Eating</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to lose weight</a>, spending hours doing cardio on a treadmill is a really <em>crappy, boring, inefficient</em> use of your time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a busy person (and I know you are), why spend hours doing something when you can be MORE efficient and build a better physique with less time?</p>
<p><em>Enter the beginner bodyweight workout.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to take you through a basic home workout today that can be completed anywhere &#8211; in your house, apartment, out at a park, in your basement, on the moon, wherever.</p>

<p><iframe title="Beginner Body Weight Circuit Workout | Nerd Fitness" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qvhHhDNjtxM?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>This is the Beginner Bodyweight Workout (3 Circuits): </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>20 Bodyweight squats.</li>
<li>10 Push-ups.</li>
<li>10 Walking lunges (each leg).</li>
<li>10 Dumbbell rows (use a milk jug or other weight).</li>
<li>15 Second Plank.</li>
<li>30 Jumping jacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>See our section below on <a href="#best_beginner_bodyweight_exercises">best bodyweight exercises</a> to see how to do each of these exercises!</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/circuit-training-build-some-muscles-burn-some-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuit routine</a>, you&#8217;ll do each exercise in succession without a break in between (if you&#8217;re able).</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished all exercises in the circuit, do it again.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still able after the 2nd run through, go for a third.</p>
<p>Because all of these exercises come one after another, you&#8217;re bound to get tired &#8211; and that&#8217;s okay!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to stop and take a break than to do an exercise incorrectly.</p>
<p><strong>Before you start, don&#8217;t forget to do a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic warm up </a></strong>&#8211; Make sure to get your heart rate pumping and get your muscles warmed or you&#8217;re just asking for injury.</p>
<p>You can run in place, jump rope, do a few push-ups, pedal on a stationary bike, do some punches and kicks, jog up and down your stairs, and/or twist and swing your arms and legs to get them moving!</p>

<p><strong>After you&#8217;ve completed your workout at home, feel free to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-stretch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cool down and stretch after</a>. </strong></p>
<p><em><b>&#8220;HOW OFTEN SHOULD I DO THE BEGINNER BODYWEIGHT WORKOUT?&#8221;</b></em></p>
<p><strong>Do this routine 2-3 times a week, but never on consecutive days</strong>.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t build muscle when you&#8217;re exercising, <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-building-muscle-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you build muscle</a> when you&#8217;re resting, so try not to do a strength training routine (of the same muscle groups) two days in a row.</p>
<p><strong>I like to follow a training pattern of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strength training on one day (like this workout).</li>
<li><a title="Interval training" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/2009/01/27/kick-your-ass-and-kickstart-your-metabolism-in-20-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 minutes of interval training</a> the next.</li>
<li>Back to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training</a>.</li>
<li>Back to interval training or rest!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternatively, pick one of these <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/25-ways-to-exercise-without-realizing-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fun exercises</a> to do on your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/what-should-i-do-on-my-off-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">off days</a> instead!</strong></p>

<h2><a name="bodyweight_workout_nutrition"></a>An Important Note About Nutrition!</h2>

<p><strong>Along with this bodyweight routine, you need to make sure you&#8217;re eating properly!</strong></p>
<p>A good workout and crappy diet <span style="text-decoration: underline;">won&#8217;t get you results</span>.</p>
<p>After all, one of the rules of the Nerd Fitness Rebellion is &#8220;you can&#8217;t outrun your fork&#8221; and you can&#8217;t out train a bad diet!</p>
<p>This means if you don&#8217;t ALSO fix your relationship with food, then all the exercise you do won&#8217;t be helping you lose weight and building muscle.</p>
<p>If you are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to lose weight</a>, then you need to fix your nutrition first and foremost. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eating healthy is key</a>!</p>
<p>You can either learn to track your food through counting calories (<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calculate your daily caloric needs here</a>), or you can look into our healthy plate strategy:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3606798" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-1-713x561.png" alt="" width="713" height="561" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-1-713x561.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-1-300x236.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-1-600x473.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-1.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;ve actually developed our own 10-level nutrition system and mindset blueprint in <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/">the Nerd Fitness Academy</a>, but let me break this down into some basics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eat natural, whole foods whenever possible.</li>
<li>Leave the soda, candy, and junk food out of your system.</li>
<li>Sugar is worse than Jar Jar Binks &#8211; cut back on sugar and liquid calories wherever you can. The stuff is in everything!</li>
<li>Swap out the grains on your plate for vegetables when you can.</li>
<li>Make sure you get enough protein each day (meat, chicken, fish) &#8211; this helps with rebuilding muscles and things like that.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The raw honest truth:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how you eat will be responsible for at <em>least </em>80% of your success or failure. </span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not kidding when I say that. If you don&#8217;t develop a healthier relationship with food, no amount of exercise will get you there.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re doing this workout program because you&#8217;re interested in losing weight, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">know that training is only 10-20% of the puzzle</span>!</p>
<p>The WORST is dutifully doing this workout routine for months or going to the gym for years and not getting results because you didn&#8217;t eat the right way!</p>
<p>That was me &#8211; I spent 6 years without results because I didn&#8217;t know how to eat correctly to go along with my training!</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have months or years to make mistakes, and just want your own Yoda to tell you what to do, you&#8217;re in the right place!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been helping busy people like you train at home and make better food decisions without hating life! It&#8217;s our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/">1-on-1 Online Coaching Program</a>, and it might be a great fit for you.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3569678" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beach-workout-713x475.jpg" alt="A great place to workout is the beach." width="713" height="475" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beach-workout.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beach-workout-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beach-workout-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re reading this guide, which means you likely have SOME goals around getting fit.</strong></p>
<p>Those goals will likely fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Feel great and look good naked &#8211;</strong> You want to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-not-suck-at-losing-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lose weight</a> (and/or <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-build-your-own-workout-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build muscle</a>) and feel comfortable in your own skin.</li>
<li><strong>Get Healthy &#8211; </strong>Your doctor told you that you need to change your ways or you&#8217;ll die an early death. Yikes.</li>
<li><strong>Be Happy</strong> &#8211; You are on the hunt for an exercise program that you don&#8217;t hate.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like to refer to these three goals as the <em>Triforce of Awesome</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603605" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Triforce.gif" alt="Nerd Fitness Triforce of Awesome" width="401" height="170" /></p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m a dork, and because you&#8217;ll remember it.</p>
<p>Happy, healthy, look good naked.</p>
<p><em>(There&#8217;s nothing wrong with wanting to look good naked, by the way. It&#8217;s why I started training all those years ago!)</em></p>
<p><strong>MY goal for you is to have you satisfy all three conditions to become healthy, happy, and look damn good.</strong></p>
<p>It starts by identifying why you&#8217;re here in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Because let&#8217;s be honest:</strong></p>
<p>This journey is gonna be tough.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615495" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/super-bad.gif" alt="The journey ahead will be tough!" width="480" height="256" /></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t just want to &#8220;lose weight&#8221; and &#8220;get fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>You want to &#8220;lose weight&#8221; and &#8220;get fit&#8221; so that you can &#8220;start dating again after a messy breakup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or because &#8220;your dad passed away from health issues at a young age and you want to be around for many more decades to raise your children.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more specific and DEEP you can get with your reasoning, the more likely you&#8217;ll be to push through when you&#8217;re struggling to stay consistent!</p>
<p><strong>I also want you to be realistic about how much time you think you can dedicate to this journey:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 days a week for 30 minutes?</li>
<li>5 days for 15 minutes each day?</li>
<li>Only on weekends?</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s cool &#8211; just be up front with yourself.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to put it all together:</p>
<p><strong>PART A &#8211; IDENTIFY A GOAL THAT YOU&#8217;RE FOCUSED ON:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;I want to lose 50 pounds.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I want to build 30 pounds of muscle.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I want to fit into my favorite dresses I haven&#8217;t been able to wear for years.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PART B &#8211; WRITE DOWN WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is your &#8220;Big Why?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll lose this weight and I can start dating again!&#8221;</li>
<li>What would getting in shape mean to you? &#8220;A better life not full of pain.&#8221;</li>
<li>Who are you doing this for? Your family? Yourself? Your wife?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PART C &#8211; BE REALISTIC WITH HOW OFTEN YOU CAN TRAIN:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m a broke college kid with lots of time. I can train 4 days per week no problem for an hour.&#8221; Great!</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m a single mom working two jobs, so I can train once per week at a gym and the rest will have to happen at home.&#8221; Amazing!</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Robot with unlimited energy and I have been sent to conquer earth.&#8221; Ruh roh. Email me.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Be specific with your answers above. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>STEP #1 TAKEAWAY: Pick your goals, pick your &#8220;Big Why&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to pick goals that work for us, and then build on top of that foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Have you written down your goals yet?:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;My goal is to lose/gain X amount of weight by X date.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;My Big Why is I want to start dating again/my wife to look at me like she used to/be an inspiration to my family.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;My plan is to train once per week and then find time elsewhere.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>We make EVERY coaching client in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/">online coaching program</a> pick their Big Why too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what keeps us on target when life gets too busy and we want to quit!</p>
<p>Now that we have a foundation, we can start to build on top of that. Like Fornite. #UnnecessaryButTopicalNerdReference</p>

<p><strong>You can lose all the weight you need to lose without doing a single minute of &#8220;exercise.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I shit you not.</p>
<p><em>(What a funny expression by the way, it makes me happy every time I use it.)</em></p>
<p>If your ONLY goal is weight loss in any way, then exercise is not necessary.</p>
<p>No treadmills. No gym memberships. No bootcamps.</p>
<p>No feeling bad about yourself training in public.</p>
<p>No <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/exercise-sucks-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hating exercise</a>.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Steve, you sorcerer, what madness is this?&#8221; You exclaim!</em></p>
<p><strong>When it comes to weight loss, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how you eat will be responsible for 90+%</span> of your success or failure.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3611117" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dog-surprised.gif" alt="Yes, diet will be 80-90% of the fitness equation." width="250" height="267" /></p>
<p>If you are only <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-not-suck-at-losing-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to lose weight</a>, ALL of your effort can go into fixing your nutrition.</p>
<p>As we say here in the Nerd Fitness Rebellion, &#8220;You can&#8217;t outrun your fork.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, this means <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you can&#8217;t lose weight</a>, you are eating too many calories compared to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many calories you burn every day</a>. I can almost guarantee it&#8217;s not your metabolism or genetics.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s because you eat too much food.</em></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve covered nutrition and weight loss EXTENSIVELY here on Nerd Fitness, so read these to help determine the best eating strategies for you:</strong></p>

<p><strong>As we have laid out in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Start Eating Healthy Guide</a>, if you are trying to lose weight it comes down to making slightly better choices, slightly more frequently:</strong></p>

<p><b><u>Story time!</u></b> Nerd Fitness Rebel Tim was told he couldn&#8217;t exercise due to an injury. He joined our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NF Academy</a>, and focused on the 3 things he could control:</p>
<ul>
<li>He fixed his nutrition.</li>
<li>He adjusted his mindset.</li>
<li>He built the <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">habit of short walks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6 months and 50+ pounds of weight loss later, Tim is a changed man! </strong>You can read <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-tim-walked-his-way-to-a-50-pound-weight-loss-wait-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his whole story</a> by clicking on the image below:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3569680" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tim-before-after-713x481.jpg" alt="Tim found his perfect workout." width="713" height="481" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tim-before-after.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tim-before-after-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tim-before-after-600x405.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>So yes, exercise burns calories and will help you get fit. </strong></p>
<p><em>(If you&#8217;re curious: <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/what-burns-more-calories-cardio-intervals-or-weight-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training is the calorie-burning victor</a> when it comes to efficient weight loss.) </em></p>
<p>Exercise of any kind will also make your heart stronger and you will FEEL better.</p>
<p>But maybe most importantly, exercise reminds us that we&#8217;re trying to be healthier.</p>
<p>Which means exercise can also remind us to make better food choices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3602602" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/real-food.gif" alt="These image shows some real food, critical if you're trying to lose body fat." width="356" height="267" /></p>
<p>Just instead of doing this: &#8220;Well I exercised today so I can eat 5000 calories!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, do this: &#8220;Well I exercised today, so I&#8217;m going to stick with my eating strategy so I don&#8217;t backslide!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP #2 TAKEAWAY: Pick a food strategy you can stick with!</span></strong></p>
<p>Pick a strategy that speaks your language, and that results in you consuming fewer calories.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nutrition is the most important thing</a>, so your time is best spent understanding this stuff!</p>
<p>If you are trying to lose more weight or build more muscle FASTER, your nutrition needs to be even MORE dialed in.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start eating healthy</a>:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Learn <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many calories you actually need</a> on a daily basis.</li>

<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569683" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/run-road.jpg" alt="Running could be a perfect workout." width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/run-road.jpg 640w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/run-road-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/run-road-600x399.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h2>
<p><strong>If your goal is to look good enough and feel good about yourself, there&#8217;s only ONE solution when it comes to the perfect workout program:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Any exercise you actually enjoy and will do regularly.</em></p>
<p>Full stop.</p>
<p>Exercise is only a 10% piece of the &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/get-in-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to get in shape</a>&#8221; formula, which means if your goal is &#8220;look pretty good, feel pretty good,&#8221; ANY exercise is a bonus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584487" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Final-Fantasy-Victory.gif" alt="These final fantasy characters know any exercise is a benefits. Including summoning magic." width="303" height="233" /></p>
<p>And that means you might as well ENJOY what you are spending your time on!</p>
<p><strong>Here are some suggestions for <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/25-ways-to-exercise-without-realizing-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fun exercise you can do</a>:</strong></p>

<p>This is me giving you permission to attend jazzercise classes regularly, if you enjoy them.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>This is me also giving you permission to never run on a treadmill ever again, unless you actually enjoy running on a treadmill.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3584033" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Treadmill.gif" alt="Make sure you know what you're doing at the gym so you don't accidentally go viral like this poor guy." width="300" height="206" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t suffer through a particular type of <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/exercise-sucks-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exercise if you hate it</a>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to get your heart racing and your body moving.</p>
<p><strong>Think of it this way:</strong> You&#8217;re always a work in progress.</p>
<p>You never get to &#8220;be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>So suffering unnecessarily to reach a goal just so you can lose some weight, and then stopping won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another phrase to internalize:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>&#8220;Temporary changes create temporary results.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Stop trying to get to the finish line as quickly as possible &#8211; that&#8217;s why you failed in the past.</p>
<p>Instead&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569686" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/paul-rudd-do-less.gif" alt="Paul Rudd says &quot;Do Less&quot;" width="498" height="291" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>STEP #3 TAKEAWAY: Do an activity that you enjoy. Do it frequently.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Write down a list of &#8220;exercise&#8221; activities you love. Write down a list of &#8220;exercise&#8221; you hate. </strong>And then do things on the first list frequently, and don&#8217;t ever do things on the second list!</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to suffer.</p>
<p>Nutrition is 90% of the battle, so if you want to lose weight, get healthier, and be happier, pick a form of exercise that you actually enjoy.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry how many calories it burns.</p>
<p>Instead, keep the focus on your nutrition and THEN do fun exercise.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>&#8220;But Steve I don&#8217;t like exercise.&#8221; </strong>You haven&#8217;t tried enough things! <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/exercise-sucks-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I too hate &#8220;exercise</a>,&#8221; so I ONLY do things I enjoy.

<p><strong>Okay, now we&#8217;re getting down to the good stuff: </strong></p>
<p>Yup, eating better can help you lose weight.</p>
<p>Yup, any exercise is better than no exercise.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, if you want to keep yourself injury free, build a physique you&#8217;re proud of (aka that &#8220;fit toned&#8221; look that everybody is after), AND get better at whatever fun activities you picked in Step #3,&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a component that needs to be incorporated into your life:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strength training</a>.</span> </strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3583748" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/push-up.gif" alt="This gif shows Staci doing a push-up in perfect form." width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p><strong>There are so <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many benefits to strength training</a>, it&#8217;s ridiculous. </strong></p>
<p>100% of people, no matter their age, gender, or size should be doing SOME kind of strength training in some capacity.</p>
<p>And please don&#8217;t worry &#8211; <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/7-strength-training-myths-every-woman-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you will NOT get too bulky &#8211; unless that&#8217;s what you want</a>.</p>
<p><strong><b>Here are 4</b><b> reasons why strength training makes every part of life better and will help you get in shape</b>:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your body is forced to burn extra calories to rebuild muscle.</strong> This &#8216;afterburner&#8217; effect of increased calorie burning lasts for 24-48 hours, which means 30 minutes of strength training will burn significantly more calories than 30 minutes of steady cardio. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/what-burns-more-calories-cardio-intervals-or-weight-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficiency ftw</a>.</li>
<li><strong>You teach your muscles to become more resilient and &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/becoming-antifragile-how-to-prepare-yourself-for-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antifragile</a>.&#8221;</strong> From giving your kids a piggy back ride to playing frisbee to carrying groceries to walking up stairs, strength training makes you safer when doing everything.</li>
<li><strong>Strength training will make you better at any activity you picked in the above section for fun exercise.</strong> Yes, even THAT activity. Let&#8217;s just say your significant other wants you to strength train.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/just-how-fast-can-i-get-the-body-i-want/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strength training builds the physique</a> you want. </strong>It&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/lose-weight-and-build-muscle-or-do-one-then-the-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best way to lose weight</a>, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-building-muscle-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to build muscle,</a> and how to keep the muscle you have while burning the fat on top of the muscle.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>So hopefully at this point you&#8217;re all:</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Steve you sly devil, I am INTRIGUED. </em><em>But strength training doesn&#8217;t seem fun, and gyms intimidate me.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>We cover this extensively in our &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-where-do-i-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginner&#8217;s guide to strength training</a>,&#8221; but I&#8217;ll cover it here too:</strong></p>
<p>When I say &#8220;strength training,&#8221; I simply mean &#8220;moving your body in a way that your muscles must respond by getting stronger:&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your muscles are introduced to outside stimuli (you pick up your kid, you do push-ups, you carry groceries, you do a squat, etc.), and they get &#8220;broken down&#8221; through use.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Over the next few days, they rebuild themselves stronger to prepare for more stimulus (a greater challenge).</p>
<p><strong>By building up strength over time, it allows you to become more functionally strong and avoid situations like Mr Potato Head here:</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569689" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MrPotatoHead-1.gif" alt="This potato is trying to workout." width="492" height="270" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Strength training&#8221; can take place in a gym or at your home, with your body weight or with free weights, in a box or with a fox. </strong>The ways to strength train are endless.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>HATE gyms?</strong> You never have to go into one. Ever. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-christina-lost-50-pounds-31-total-inches-and-did-her-first-pull-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina lost 50 lbs without a gym</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>AFRAID of weight training?</strong> You can <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">train with just your body weight</a>!</p>

<p><b>This does not need to be overcomplicated! </b></p>
<p>Start with two basic movements that you can do literally right now, even in your cubicle:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desk </span><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/proper-push-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push-Ups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 3 sets of 8</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/5-common-mistakes-when-doing-a-proper-squat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodyweight Squats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 3 sets of 8</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3584778" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/elevated-push-up.gif" alt="Do elevated push-ups to work up to regular push-ups" width="480" height="270" /></p>

<p>Boom, look at that! You just did strength training.</p>
<p><strong>I promise you:</strong> get stronger with push-ups, squats, and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/do-a-pull-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn how to do a pull-up</a>, and you will be in better shape, and look better, than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>So how do you <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get stronger</a>? Simple: &#8220;progressive overload.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>This might sound complicated, but it just means increasing the challenge by a tiny amount with each workout so your body has to work harder and adapt more each time.</p>
<p>And then one day, you&#8217;ll look in the mirror and say: &#8220;WHOA I HAVE MUSCLES WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN!?&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569690" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Little-Giants.gif" alt="Look at me all big and strong!" width="500" height="278" /></p>
<p><strong>I have one final person I want to address:</strong> <em>&#8220;But Steve, you nincompoop, I hate strength training.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a nice name to call me, but fair enough!</p>

<p><b>Alright alright, you read the previous section, and you&#8217;re thinking:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Steve I heard training individual body parts like a bodybuilder is the best for muscle building.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What about Stronglifts 5&#215;5 or Starting Strength or <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-crossfit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CrossFit</a>?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I hear I should ONLY do free weights, and machines are the devil!&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My thoughts: I don&#8217;t care HOW you strength train when you get started, or which <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-where-do-i-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginning strength training program</a> you pick: </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you want to follow a bodybuilder routine that uses lots of machines and isolation exercises, great!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you want to train your left bicep and right butt muscle on Tuesdays and right tricep and left shoulder on Wednesdays and so on, go for it!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you want to follow a workout DVD or follow bootcamp style stuff on YouTube, great.</p>

<p>Your body is a complex machine that uses all of your muscles in unison when you do physical activity.</p>
<p>Thus, it&#8217;s safer and more efficient to train with compound movements instead of isolated movements.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/circuit-training-build-some-muscles-burn-some-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Circuit Training Routines</a> that use these exercises.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Keep it simple.</strong> If you make progress every week by <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-much-weight-should-i-be-lifting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picking up more weight</a> or <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-correct-number-of-reps-per-set-in-the-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doing more reps</a>, your body WILL transform like Optimus Prime.</p>
<p>But like, into a better version of you, not a robot:</p>

<p><strong>Okay, now we&#8217;re getting down to the secret sauce that has <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformed thousands upon thousands</a> of lives at Nerd Fitness.</strong></p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t worry our secret sauce is low calorie, low carb, and keto-friendly. </em></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the scenario:</strong> you have a goal of losing 50 pounds, and after eating better and moving more&#8230;you actually start to lose some weight!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so proud of you.</p>
<p>In fact, I just called your mom to tell her what a swell person you are. Nice lady.</p>
<p><strong>Anyways, things are going well until you start to approach your goal weight (woo!) and encounter a divergent path:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path A:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m about to reach my goal weight! I can be done soon!&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Path B:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m approaching my goal weight. What is my new body capable of?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>People who pick Path A always backslide and usually put the weight back on over the next few months and years. This is why <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-10-key-differences-between-weight-loss-success-and-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most people are doomed to fail</a> at losing weight permanently:</p>
<p>Temporary action = temporary results.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569209" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/house-crap.gif" alt="Dr. House knows that temporary changes create temporary results" width="378" height="212" /></p>
<p><strong>Now let&#8217;s talk about Path B?</strong> It&#8217;s the reason our coaching clients keep the weight off and continue to transform.</p>
<p>Consistent effort + progressive challenge = permanent improvement.</p>
<p><strong>People on Path B ask themselves, &#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve lost this weight, what am I capable of? Let&#8217;s train for that!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This is a distinct mental shift.</p>
<p>Exercise is no longer a means to an end.</p>
<p>There is no end.</p>
<p>Just like there is no spoon.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569694" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/matrix-spoon.gif" alt="&quot;There is no spoon&quot;" width="245" height="180" /></p>
<p><strong>We encourage our Rebels to shift from weight loss goals to physical challenges (Like <em>Double Dare</em>, but with less Gak):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-handstands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handstand</a>, let&#8217;s start training to get better at those.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always want to do <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/lord-of-the-rings-how-to-get-in-great-shape-using-gymnastic-rings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">train with gymnastic rings</a>! Let&#8217;s try that!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/couch-to-5k-crucial-things-to-know-before-you-start-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run a 5k</a>, I will adjust my routine to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/running-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">become a stronger runner</a>.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I want to try Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I will sign up for a class!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna sign up for Swing Dancing so I can crush the dance floor at the next wedding I attend.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>WHY THIS WORKS:</strong> By training to get better at a particular activity, you are triggering the same processes in your brain that makes us hooked on progressing in video games:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569695" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/level-up-sword.gif" alt="It's time to reach the next level in your workout." width="500" height="252" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s why we say, &#8220;just one more level!&#8221; or &#8220;I bet I can do one more rep!&#8221; or &#8220;I can climb this new path that&#8217;s tougher than any path I&#8217;ve attempted before!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>STEP #6 TAKEAWAY:</strong></span><strong> Shift from weight loss goals to physical challenges.</strong></p>
<p>As you start to get in shape, updating your mindset can be a HUGE game-changer.</p>
<p>You spent all this work building a new body &#8211; take it out for a test drive and find out what you&#8217;re capable of!</p>
<p>Counterintuitively, the less you worry about your weight and the more you worry about your performance, the more likely you&#8217;ll be to build a body you&#8217;re proud of, that&#8217;s functional, and that you can keep, permanently.</p>
<p><strong>As they say, &#8220;Appearance is a consequence of fitness.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>If you want to dig more into skills and advanced physique stuff, read our post here: &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-any-physique-or-skill-set/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ultimate guide to building any physique</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pick a skill, pick somebody farther along (more fit) than you to model yourself after, and adjust your training and nutrition to get better at that skill.</p>
<p>When you get better and better at these physical skills, your physique will start to improve as a side effect.</p>

<p><strong>As we&#8217;re talking about physique and physical goals, I want to address something that is a major challenge for many people:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Steve, I want to lose some weight, build some muscle, and also build up more endurance. I want to get strong and run a marathon but also look like a model. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Oh and get a six pack. But I don&#8217;t want to be too bulky. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Can I do this in 6 weeks please?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s the truth: your body can only do so many things at once, and the three goals above will pull your body in three completely separate directions. </strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what are realistic goals, I have answers for you on BOTH questions (click each to learn more):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/just-how-fast-can-i-get-the-body-i-want/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How fast can I get fit and lose weight</a>?&#8221;</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-2 pounds per week of weight loss</span> is a safe pace. Could be more or less depending on your starting weight, how you eat, and how you train.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-fast-can-i-build-muscle-naturally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How fast can I build muscle naturally</a>?&#8221;</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-2 pounds of muscle gain per month</span> is possible under optimal conditions for most. This could be more or less depending on your level of experience, how you eat, and how you train.</li>
<li><b>&#8220;Can I do both at the same time?&#8221;</b> As we point out in our article on &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/lose-weight-and-build-muscle-or-do-one-then-the-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaining muscle and losing weight at same time</a>,&#8221; it IS possible &#8211; but requires you to be really dialed in with eating enough protein, maintaining a slight calorie deficit, and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavy strength training</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are those numbers in line with your expectations?</strong> Do you wish you could <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/get-in-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in shape faster</a>?</p>
<p>Of course you do. So do I!</p>
<p>For example, it took me <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/losing-the-last-20-pounds-7-lessons-learned-while-still-eating-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 months of focused effort to lose 22 pounds safely and sustainably</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly, by changing our timeline to be more realistic, we can make better progress than at any point in the past:</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="Want to get in shape? Think in days and years, not weeks and months" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ieY_8ZL0v78?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY TAKEAWAY #7</span>: Have realistic expectations!</strong></p>
<p>Have the right expectations, and put your focus on the process.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get there when you get there &#8211; so just focus on what you can do today.</p>
<p><b>If you&#8217;re not sure if you should build muscle first or lose weight first, here&#8217;s my humble advice:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Eat a SLIGHT caloric deficit. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strength train</a> and move a lot.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eat enough protein</a> and train heavy to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/lose-weight-and-build-muscle-or-do-one-then-the-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lose fat and keep your muscle</a>.</li>
<li>Do this until you get down to a low enough <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/body-fat-percentage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">body fat percentage</a> (10-11% for men, 17-18% for women).</li>
<li>Now, increase your caloric intake slightly. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-building-muscle-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build strength and muscle</a> until you&#8217;re at your desired size.</li>
<li>Decide now if you want to reintroduce cardio, cut more fat, or keep getting bigger.</li>
<li>Repeat!</li>

<p><strong>I love sharing stories on Nerd Fitness of REAL people, with real struggles, that found the perfect program that fit THEIR lifestyle, like <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-christina-lost-50-pounds-31-total-inches-and-did-her-first-pull-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina above</a>. </strong></p>
<p>These are not people with superior genetics. They&#8217;re not on steroids, nor are they choking down supplements (<em><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/what-supplements-should-i-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most supplements are a waste of money</a>).</em></p>
<p>The success stories in our community work full-time jobs, have kids, friends, and nerdy hobbies.</p>
<p>Some are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-a-single-busy-mom-lost-100-pounds-with-nerd-fitness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single moms</a>.</p>
<p>But they found a workout program that works for their life situation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Some of them are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/female-powerlifters-meet-staci-ardison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powerlifters</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Some of them <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-christina-lost-50-pounds-31-total-inches-and-did-her-first-pull-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">train at home with no equipment</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Some of them <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/couch-to-5k-crucial-things-to-know-before-you-start-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run 5ks</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As you are starting to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/get-in-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get yourself into better shape</a>, who you associate with is almost as important as how you train.</strong></p>
<p>Sounds ludicrous (did I just make you yell, &#8220;Luda!&#8221;?), but it can be the difference between long term success and long term floundering. And not the cute kind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569698" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Flounder-1.gif" alt="Flounder likes to workout." width="500" height="303" /></p>
<p><strong>They say you are an average of the 5 people you associate most with. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Think about your roommates, significant other, friends, and coworkers:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Are they people who have succeeded in the way you want to succeed, support you on your journey, can answer questions you might have, and make you want to continue being better?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Or are they people who ask you to skip your workouts, make fun of you for waking up early to train on a Saturday morning, and enable you rather than support you?</p>
<p>The more time you can spend with Group A people, the more likely you&#8217;ll be to stay on target and make progress.</p>
<p><strong>As you are getting better at a skill, do whatever you can to hang out with people who are good at that skill!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Like running and want to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/running-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get better at running</a>?</strong> Join or start a running club!</li>
<li><strong>Want to take <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powerlifting</a> more seriously?</strong> <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-personal-trainer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hire a personal trainer</a> or join a powerlifting club.</li>

<li><strong>Want to look like <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-crossfit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CrossFit athletes</a>?</strong> Great! Join the cult! I kid, CFers, you&#8217;re good in my book 🙂</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have people in your life that are making you better, consider <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hiring a coach</a> or instructor or joining a class to help you push yourself even farther and stay accountable!</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not telling you to fire your friends, but you might <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/katniss-shows-us-that-sometimes-sacrifice-is-necessary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need to make sacrifices like Katniss</a> until you&#8217;re better equipped to stand up for your new healthy lifestyle when they want you to come back to the dark side!</p>
<p><strong>Nerd Fitness helps people with workouts and eating better, sure.</strong></p>
<p>But I believe we get permanent results for people because we do our best to foster the most supportive community on the internet.</p>
<p>Many of our success stories have 1-on-1 instruction from our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Coaching Program</a>, while some come from our self-paced <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NF Academy</a>.</p>
<p>And others? They read the free articles on Nerd Fitness and helped themselves stay on target!</p>
<p>It comes down to learning from and interacting people who are just like you, or who are people that you want to be like when you &#8220;grow up&#8221; (get in shape)!</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Thanks Steve, but that was a lot. What do I do now?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let me recap Steps #1-#8:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step #1: What Are Your Workout Goals?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step #2: What Workout Is Best for Weight Loss?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step #3: Finding a Workout Routine You Enjoy</span></li>

</ul>
<p>Depending on where you&#8217;re at in life, and how much weight you need to lose, you might be satisfied with just Steps 1, 2, and 3 for the next few years.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s awesome!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3588327" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/captain-marvel.gif" alt="Captain Marvel is stoked you want to start working out!" width="480" height="198" /></p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re ready to do more than that, we&#8217;re here for ya too.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re looking for me to actually tell you what to do, I would suggest the following:</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a strategy optimized for effortless awesomeness, happiness, and look-good nakedness<strong>:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Strength train twice per week: squats, pushups, and pull-ups.</li>
<li>Do fun activity 1-2x per week.</li>
<li>Walk when you can.</li>
<li>Focus on your nutrition.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I would start there, and then do two things after 30 days:</strong></p>
<p>#1) Track your compliance to see if you actually did the workouts!</p>
<p>Did you go for walks, strength train twice per week, and do a fun activity? <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-track-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can track this</a> on your calendar or in a notebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes? Great! Move on to question 2.</li>
<li>No? Great! You learned you tried to do too much. Do less and repeat for another 30 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>#2) Measure if you got closer to your goal weight/skills/physique?</p>
<p>Are you healthier, happier, and more confident?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes? Great! Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing!</li>
<li>No? Great! That strategy didn&#8217;t work. Track your food intake, adjust your diet. Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#8220;Steve that&#8217;s still not specific enough. I want you to tell me, for my exact situation, what to do every single day to reach my goals. Oh and hold me accountable. K thanks.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re going to take two widely accepted healthy eating “rules” and turn them on their head:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>RULE #1: You HAVE to eat first thing in the morning: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you start off with a healthy breakfast, so you can get that metabolism firing first thing in the morning! </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are even studies that show those that eat earlier in the day lose more weight than those who ate later in the day or skipped a meal.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>RULE #2: Eat lots of small meals for weight loss. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you eat six small meals throughout the day so your metabolism stays operating at maximum capacity all day long.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">eat breakfast and lots of small meals to lose weight and obtain optimal health.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if there’s science and research that shows SKIPPING BREAKFAST (the horror! blasphemy!) can help with optimum human performance, mental and physical health improvement, maximum muscle retention, and body fat loss?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588320" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shocked-cat.gif" alt="This cat is surprised at the evidence that fasting may be better than eating breakfast." width="299" height="283" /></p>
<p><b>That’s where an Intermittent Fasting Plan comes in.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intermittent fasting is not a diet, but rather a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dieting pattern</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><em>In simpler terms: it&#8217;s making a conscious decision to skip certain meals on purpose.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;">By fasting and then feasting deliberately, intermittent fasting generally means that you consume your calories during a specific window of the day, and choose not to eat food for a larger window of time.</span></p>
<p><strong>There are a few different ways to take advantage of intermittent fasting, which I learned about from Martin over at <a href="https://leangains.com/the-leangains-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeanGains</a>, a resource specifically built around fasted strength training:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>INTERMITTENT FASTING 16/8 PLAN</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Fasting for 16 hours and then only eating within a specific 8-hour window. For example, only eating from noon-8 PM, essentially skipping breakfast.</p>
<p>Some people only eat in a 6-hour window, or even a 4-hour window. This is &#8220;feasting&#8221; and &#8220;fasting&#8221; parts of your days and the most common form of Intermittent Fasting. It&#8217;s also my preferred method (4 years running).</p>
<p><strong>Two examples:</strong> The top means you are skipping breakfast, the bottom means you are skipping dinner each day:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588422 size-large" title="Intermittent Fasting Schedule" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/intermittent-fasting-plan-713x301.jpg" alt="This is an example of an intermittent fasting plan.

<p><strong>You can adjust this window to make it work for your life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If you start eating at: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">7AM, stop eating and start fasting at 3pm.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If you start eating at: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">11AM, stop eating and start fasting at 7pm.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If you start eating at: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">2PM, stop eating and start fasting at 10pm.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>If you start eating at: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">6PM, stop eating and start fasting at 2AM.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>INTERMITTENT FASTING 24 HOUR PLAN</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Skip two meals one day, where you take 24 hours off from eating.</strong> For example, eat on a normal schedule (finishing dinner at 8PM) and then you don&#8217;t eat again until 8PM the following day.</p>
<p>With this plan, you eat your normal 3 meals per day, and then occasionally pick a day to skip breakfast and lunch the next day.</p>
<p>If you can only do an 18 hour fast, or a 20 hour fast, or a 22 hour fast &#8211; that&#8217;s okay! Adjust with different time frames and see how your body responds.</p>
<p><strong>Two examples:</strong> skipping breakfast and lunch one day of the week, and then another where you skip lunch and dinner one day, two days in a week.</p>

<p>Those are the two most popular intermittent fasting plans, and the two we&#8217;ll be focusing on, though there are many variations of both that you can modify for yourself.</p>
<p>Some people eat in a 4 hour window, others do 6 or 8.</p>
<p>Some people do 20 hour fasts or 24 hour fasts.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to experiment, adjust to work for your lifestyle and goals, and see how your body responds.</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s first get into the science here behind Intermittent Fasting and why you should consider it!</em></p>
<h2><a name="how__does_intermittent_fasting_work"></a>How Does Intermittent Fasting Work?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3588424" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cogs-713x475.jpg" alt="Your body is a machine, like these cogs are, and it operates differently during a fast." width="713" height="475" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cogs.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cogs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cogs-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>Now, you might be thinking: &#8220;okay, so by skipping a meal, I will eat less than I normally eat on average (2 meals instead of 3), and thus I will lose weight, right?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>By cutting out an entire meal each day, you are consuming fewer calories per week &#8211; even if your two meals per day are slightly bigger than before. Overall, you&#8217;re still consuming fewer calories per day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588358" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/calories-comparison-for-IF-1.png" alt="This shows you the differences in calorie consumption if you skip a meal with intermittent fasting." width="650" height="413" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/calories-comparison-for-IF-1.png 704w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/calories-comparison-for-IF-1-300x190.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/calories-comparison-for-IF-1-600x381.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>In this example, you’re eating LARGER lunches and dinners than you normally do, but by skipping breakfast you’ll consume 500 less calories per day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And thus, weight loss!  </span></p>
<p>This is highlighted in a recent JAMA study<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in which both calorie restricted dieters and intermittent fasters lost similar amounts of weight over a year period.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t tell the FULL story, as the timing of meals can also influence how your body reacts.</p>
<p><strong>Intermittent Fasting can help because your body operates differently when &#8220;feasting&#8221; compared to when &#8220;fasting&#8221;:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>When you eat a meal, your body spends a few hours processing that food, burning what it can from what you just consumed. </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because it has all of this readily-available, easy to burn energy (thanks to the food you ate), your body will choose to use that as energy rather than the fat you have stored.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During the &#8220;fasted state&#8221; (the hours in which your body is not consuming or digesting any food) your body doesn&#8217;t have a recently consumed meal to use as energy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thus, it is <em>more likely</em> to pull from the fat stored in your body as it&#8217;s the only energy source readily available.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Burning fat = win.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588251" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/win.gif" alt="If you can burn a little extra fat while intermittent fasting, that could be a win!" width="210" height="284" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The same goes for working out in a &#8220;fasted&#8221; state.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Without a ready supply of glucose and glycogen to pull from (which has been depleted over the course of your fasted state, and hasn&#8217;t yet been replenished with a pre-workout meal), your body is forced to adapt and pull from a source of energy that it does have available: the fat stored in your cells.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this work?</strong> Our bodies react to energy consumption (eating food) with insulin production.</p>
<p>The more sensitive your body is to insulin, the more likely you&#8217;ll be to use the food you consume efficiently, and your body is most sensitive to insulin following a period of fasting<em> </em><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These changes to insulin production and sensitivity can help lead to weight loss <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and muscle creation <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Your glycogen (a starch stored in your muscles and liver that your body can burn as fuel when necessary) is depleted during sleep (aka during fasting), and will be depleted even further during training, which can lead to increased insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>This means that a meal following your workout will be used more efficiently:</strong> converted to glycogen and stored up in your muscles or burned as energy immediately to help with the recovery process, with minimal amounts stored as fat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Compare this to a regular day (no intermittent fasting):</strong> With insulin sensitivity at normal levels, the carbs and foods consumed will see full glycogen stores and enough glucose in the bloodstream, and thus be more likely to get stored as fat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;"><strong>Back to fasting:</strong> growth hormone is increased during fasted states (both </span>during sleep<span style="line-height: 1.6316em;"> <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-6" id="refmark-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;">and after a period of fasting). Combine this </span>increased growth hormone secretion:<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-7" id="refmark-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;">, the decrease in insulin production (and thus increase in </span>insulin sensitivity <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-8" id="refmark-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;">), and you&#8217;re essentially priming your body for muscle growth and fat loss with intermittent fasting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The less science-y version:</strong> Intermittent fasting can help teach your body to use the food it consumes more efficiently, and your body can learn to burn fat as fuel when you deprive it of new calories to constantly pull from (if you eat all day long).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>TL/DR:</strong> For many different physiological reasons, fasting can help promote weight loss and muscle building when done properly.</p>

<h2><a name="six_small_meals"></a><b>Should I Eat 6 Small Meals a Day?</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3588425" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/small-plates-713x475.jpg" alt="Should you eat small meals like these, or larger meals broken up by fasting?" width="713" height="475" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/small-plates.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/small-plates-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/small-plates-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>There are a few main reasons why diet books recommend six small meals:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1) When you eat a meal, your body <em>does</em> have to burn extra calories </strong><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-9" id="refmark-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><strong> just to process that meal.</strong> So, the theory is that if you eat all day long with small meals, your body is constantly burning extra calories and your metabolism is firing at optimal capacity, right? Well, that&#8217;s not true.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whether you eat 2000 calories spread out throughout the day, or 2000 calories in a small window, your body will burn the same number of calories processing the food <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-10" id="refmark-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, the whole &#8220;keep your metabolism firing at optimum capacity by always eating&#8221; sounds good in principle, but reality tells a different story.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2) When you eat smaller meals, you <em>might</em> be less likely to overeat during your regular meals.</strong> I can definitely see some truth here, especially for people who struggle with portion control or don&#8217;t know how much food they should be eating.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, once you educate yourself and take control of your eating, some might find that eating six times a day is very prohibitive and requires a lot of effort. I know I do.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Also, because you&#8217;re eating six small meals, I&#8217;d argue that you probably never feel &#8220;full,&#8221; and you might be MORE likely to eat extra calories during each snack.</p>
<p>Although grounded in seemingly logical principles, the &#8220;six meals a day&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work for the reason you think it would (#1), and generally only works for people who struggle with portion control (#2).</p>
<p>If we think back to caveman days, we&#8217;d have been in serious trouble as a species if we <em>had</em> to eat every three hours. Do you think Joe Caveman pulled out his pocket sundial six times a day to consume his equally portioned meals?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588254" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cave-person.gif" alt="Fasting was probably a natural condition for our cavemen ancestors. " width="436" height="326" /></p>
<p>Hell no! He ate when he could, endured and dealt with long periods of NOT eating (no refrigeration or food storage) and his body adapted to still function optimally enough to still go out and catch new food.</p>
<p><strong>A recent study (written about in the NYT, highlighted by <a href="https://leangains.com/new-meal-frequency-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeanGains</a>) has done a great job of challenging the &#8220;six-meals-a-day&#8221; technique for weight loss <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-11" id="refmark-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There were [no statistical] differences between the low- and high- [meal frequency] groups for adiposity indices, appetite measurements or gut peptides (peptide YY and ghrelin) either before or after the intervention. We conclude that increasing meal frequency does not promote greater body weight loss under the conditions described in the present study.</p>
<p>Factor in the potential physiological benefits listed in the previous section, and you got yourself some damn good science-backed evidence to consider trying Intermittent Fasting if you want to decrease body fat and build muscle.</p>
<h2><a name="should_i_try_intermittent_fasting"></a>Should I Try intermittent fasting? (6 Things to Consider)</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3588426" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/intermittent-fast-plate-713x476.jpg" alt="Fruit is a great and healthy way to break a fasting period." width="713" height="476" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/intermittent-fast-plate.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/intermittent-fast-plate-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/intermittent-fast-plate-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>Now that we&#8217;re through a lot of the science stuff, let&#8217;s get into the reality of the situation: why should you consider Intermittent Fasting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>#1) Because it can work for your goals. </strong>Although we know that <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/is-a-calorie-really-just-a-calorie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not all calories are created equal</a>, caloric restriction plays a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">central role in weight loss</a>.</p>
<p>When you fast, you are also making it easier to restrict your total caloric intake over the course of the week, which can lead to consistent weight loss and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>#2) Because it simplifies your day.</strong> Rather than having to prepare, pack, eat, and time your meals every 2-3 hours, you simply skip a meal or two and only worry about eating food in your eating window.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one less decision you have to make every day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3588327" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/captain-marvel.gif" alt="Captain Marvel loves simplifying her eating pattern with intermittent fasting." width="480" height="198" /></p>
<p>It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average.</p>
<p><strong>#3) It requires less time (and potentially less money).</strong> Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals.</p>
<p>Instead of stopping what you&#8217;re doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice.</p>
<p>Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two.</p>
<p><strong>#4) It promotes stronger insulin sensitivity and increased growth hormone secretion, two keys for weight loss and muscle gain. </strong>Intermittent fasting helps you create a double whammy for weight loss and building a solid physique.</p>
<p><strong>#5) It can level up your brain, including positively counteracting conditions like Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, and dementia.</strong></p>
<p>As explained here in this TEDx talk by Mark Mattson, Professor at Johns Hopkins University and Chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, fasting is grounded in serious research and more studies are coming out showing the benefits:</p>

<h2><a name="negative_effects_of_intermittent_fasting"></a>What Are the Negative Effects of intermittent fasting?</h2>

<p><strong>In my own experimentation <b>with Intermittent Fasting since 2014</b>, I have found very few negative side effects with Intermittent Fasting. </strong></p>
<p>The biggest concern most people have is that Intermittent Fasting will lead to lower energy, focus, and the &#8220;holy crap I am hungry&#8221; feeling during the fasting period and ruin them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588255" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hangry-muppet.gif" alt="Will fasting make you hangry like this Muppet? Most likely, you will get use to your new eating pattern." width="304" height="264" /></p>
<p>People are concerned that they will spend all morning being miserable because they haven&#8217;t consumed any food, and thus will be miserable at work and ineffective at whatever task it is they are working on.</p>
<p><strong>The following are my thoughts and experiences, and your results may vary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes, the initial transition from EATING ALL THE TIME, to intermittent fasting MIGHT be a bit of a jolt to your system; it was for me. </strong></p>
<p>However, once I got through the transition after a few days, my body quickly adapted and learned to function just as well only eating a few times a day.</p>
<p>Although I fast for 16 hours per day with no issues, the following might help assuage your fears that skipping breakfast will cause your body to eat itself and your brain to implode:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>After 48-hours of fasting in a recent study</strong> <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-12" id="refmark-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a><strong>,</strong> &#8220;cognitive performance, activity, sleep, and mood are not adversely affected in healthy humans by two days of calorie-deprivation.&#8221; You&#8217;ll be fasting for far less time than that.</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;So why do I feel grouchy and lethargic when I skip breakfast?&#8221;</strong> </em></p>
<p>In this nerd&#8217;s humble opinion, a good portion of the grumpiness is a result of past eating habits. If you eat every three hours normally, and normally eat as soon as you wake up, your body will start to get hungry every three hours as it <span style="font-weight: 400;">is now used to consuming </span>food every three hours.</p>
<p>If you eat breakfast every morning, your body expects to wake up and eat food.</p>
<p>Once you retrain your body to NOT expect food all day every day (or first thing in the morning), these side-effects become less of an issue. In addition, ghrelin (a hormone that makes you hungry <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-13" id="refmark-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>), is actually lowest in the mornings and decreases after a few hours of not eating too. The hunger pains will naturally pass!</p>
<p>Personally, I found this grumpiness subsided after a few days and now my mornings actually energize me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588376" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Energizer-Bunny.gif" alt="Does this bunny fast in the morning to get his energy?" width="379" height="278" /></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s important to understand that Intermittent Fasting is NOT a cure-all panacea.</strong> Don&#8217;t delude yourself into thinking that if you skip breakfast and then eat 4,000 calories of candy bars for lunch and dinner that you will lose weight.</p>
<p><strong>If you have an addictive relationship with food and you struggle with portion control,<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> figure out your calorie goals</a> and track your calorie intake in your meals to make sure you&#8217;re not overeating.</strong></p>
<p>If you skip breakfast, you might be so hungry from this that you OVEREAT for lunch and this can lead to weight gain. Again, the important thing here is that with an intermittent fasting plan, you&#8217;re eating fewer calories than normal because you&#8217;re skipping a meal every day.</p>
<p><strong>Think about it in caveman terms again.</strong> We certainly found ways to survive during periods of feast and famine, and that remains true today. Imagine if you needed to eat in order to be active and alert: what would hungry cavemen do?</p>
<p>They would go find food, and that probably required a ton of effort. It actually takes our bodies about 84 hours of fasting <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-14" id="refmark-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> before our glucose levels are adversely affected. As we&#8217;re talking about small fasts (16-24 hour periods), this doesn&#8217;t concern us.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT:</span> </strong>Intermittent Fasting can be more complex for people who have issues with blood sugar regulation, suffer from hypoglycemia, have diabetes, etc. If you fit into this category, check with your doctor or dietitian before adjusting your eating schedule. It also affects women differently (<a href="#intermittent_fasting_for_men_and_women">there&#8217;s a whole section dedicated to that here</a>).</p>

<p>I still eat roughly the same number of calories I was consuming before, but instead of eating all damn day long, I condense all of my calorie consumption into an eight hour window.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;"><strong>11 AM</strong> Work out with heavy strength training in a fasted state.</span></li>
<li><strong>12 PM</strong> Immediately consume 1/2 of my calories for the day (a regular whole-food meal, followed by a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calorie-dense homemade protein shake</a>).</li>
<li><strong>7 PM</strong> Consume the second portion of my calories for the day in a big dinner.</li>
<li><strong>8 PM &#8211; 12 PM the next day:</strong> Fast for 16 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In a different method, my friend Nate Green packed on a crazy amount of muscle while fasting for a full 24 hours on Sundays &#8211; so it is possible. </strong><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-15" id="refmark-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not kidding when I say this has revolutionized how I look at muscle building and fat loss.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588332" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mind-blown.gif" alt="Intermittent Fasting can change how we look at gaining muscle and losing weight. " width="356" height="267" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, this method flies in the face of the typical &#8220;bulk and cut&#8221; techniques of overeating to build muscle (along with adding a lot of fat) before cutting calories to lose fat (along with some muscle) and settling down at a higher weight.</p>
<p><strong>I prefer this method to the bulk-and-cut technique for a few reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 19px;"><strong>There&#8217;s far less of a crazy swing to your weight.</strong> If you are putting on 30 pounds and then cutting 25 to gain 5 lbs of muscle, your body is going through drastic swings of body mass. Your clothes will fit differently, you&#8217;ll have different levels of definition, and your body will wonder what the hell is going on.</span></li>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re consuming less food and thus spending less money.</strong> Rather than overeating to put on 1 pound of muscle and 4 pounds of fat in a week or two, you&#8217;re aiming to eat exactly enough to put on 1 pound of muscle without adding much fat on top of it. Yeah, it&#8217;s a delicate balance, but there&#8217;s far less swing involved. You are just slowly, steadily, and consistently building muscle and strength over many months.</li>
<li><strong>There&#8217;s never a need to get &#8220;vacation-ready&#8221;: we all want to look good naked, right?</strong> When you are just adding muscle, you don&#8217;t need to worry about getting your body ready before by drastically altering your diet (avoiding a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/does-the-military-diet-actually-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miserable crash diet like the Military Diet</a>). <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-16" id="refmark-16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>You can make small adjustments and stay on target.</strong> Keep your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/body-fat-percentage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">body fat percentage low</a>, build strength and muscle, and if you happen to notice your body fat creeping up, cut back on the carbs. Within two weeks you should be back at your preferred body fat percentage and can continue the muscle building process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A note on BCAA consumption.</strong> Martin from LeanGains <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-17" id="refmark-17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> recommends consuming Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA&#8217;s) as a supplement with regards to fasted training to aid your muscles through your workout.</p>
<p>Personally, I used BCAAs for about 6-8 months during my initial start with fasted training (consuming them before training), though haven&#8217;t used them in the past 2+ years. I didn&#8217;t notice any adverse effects to not taking them with regards to my performance. Your value may vary!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it should go without saying that if you want to build muscle while fasting, you need to work out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifting heavy</a>.</span></p>

<p><strong>We have a crazy <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-keto-diet-or-ketogenic-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensive guide on the Keto Diet</a> in case you&#8217;re not familiar with it, so here it is in a nutshell:</strong></p>
<p>By only eating fat and protein, your body must adapt to run on fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. In the absence of carbs/glucose, your body converts fats to ketones and uses them for fuel.</p>
<p><strong>This process is called &#8220;ketosis,&#8221; and there are two ways for a body to enter ketosis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eating in a way that induces ketosis (very low carb, high fat).</li>
<li>Fasting&#8230;Hey, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re reading about right now!</li>
</ul>
<p>We actually have an amazing success story here on Nerd Fitness, Larry, who followed our strategies, went Keto and start intermittent fasting. He ended up losing weight, getting stronger, AND overcame the challenges of rheumatoid arthritis (click on the image for <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-larry-beat-rheumatoid-arthritis-and-got-strong-as-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his story</a>)!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-824275 size-large" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/before_after_Larry-713x389.jpg" alt="Larry transformed through the Keto Diet and Intermittent Fasting." width="713" height="389" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/before_after_Larry-713x389.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/before_after_Larry-300x164.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/before_after_Larry-768x419.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/before_after_Larry-160x87.jpg 160w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/before_after_Larry.jpg 824w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><b>Here&#8217;s how the fasting portion of it works:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As your body enters a fast period when there are no sources of glucose energy readily available, the liver begins the process of breaking down fat into ketones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fasting itself can trigger ketosis.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Fasting for a period of time before kicking off a Keto-friendly eating plan COULD speed your transition into the metabolic state of ketosis, and fasting intermittently while in ketosis could help you maintain that state.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I personally love fasting for the simplicity: I skip breakfast every day and train in a fasted state. It’s one less decision I have to make, it’s one less opportunity to make a bad food choice, and it helps me reach my goals.</p>
<p><strong>WHY KETO + IF WORKS =</strong> eating Keto can be really challenging. And every time you eat, it’s an opportunity to do it wrong and accidentally eat foods that knock you out of ketosis.</p>
<p>You’re also tempted to overeat.</p>
<p>So, by skipping a meal, you’re eliminating one meal, one decision, one chance to screw up.</p>
<p><em>Note: if you’re thinking “Steve, am I losing weight because I’m skipping 1/3rd of my meals for the day, AND eliminating an entire macronutrient?”, then you&#8217;d be right</em><em>. </em></p>
<p><em>Both Keto and IF have secondary effects that could also be factoring in &#8211; physiological benefits which I explain in both articles.</em></p>
<p>Your value may vary!</p>
<p><strong>You need to decide what works for you.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3588340" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/you-do-you.gif" alt="As this gif explains, you need to do you when it comes to intermittent fasting. " width="353" height="200" /></p>
<p>You probably won&#8217;t become &#8220;keto-adapted&#8221; (your body running on ketones) just skipping breakfast every day &#8211; your body will still have enough glucose stored from your carb-focused meals for lunch and dinner the day before.</p>
<p>In order to use fasting to enter ketosis, the fast needs to be long enough to deplete your carb/glucose stores, or you need to severely restrict carbohydrates from your meals in addition to IF in order to enter ketosis.</p>
<p><strong>MORAL OF THE STORY: </strong>Experiment and try different strategies that will work for you.</p>
<p>By skipping a meal or minimizing carbohydrate intake, you&#8217;re more likely than not to lose weight:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can do intermittent fasting without eating a Keto Diet and lose weight.</li>
<li>You can do a Keto Diet without intermittent Fasting and lose weight.</li>
<li>You can combine them and lose weight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sticking with Keto is BRUTALLY difficult, and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probably not the right diet</a> for 98% of the planet. </strong>Those people would be better off following our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Start Eating Healthy&#8221; guide</a> with small changes.</p>

<h2><a name="intermittent_fasting_for_men_and_women"></a>Does Intermittent Fasting Have Different Effects on Men and Women?</h2>

<p><strong>The quick answer is: &#8220;yes, Intermittent Fasting can affect men and women differently.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>Anecdotally, we have many women in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online coaching program</a> that swear by Intermittent Fasting, while others have had adverse effects.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig into the science and studies.</p>
<p><strong>A recent PubMed summary concluded that</strong> &#8220;fasting can be prescribed as a safe medical intervention as well as a lifestyle regimen which can improve women’s health in many folds <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-18" id="refmark-18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Now, in that extract, many of the studies cited are focused on specifically calorie restriction (and not just fasting), and they also say that &#8220;future studies should address this gap by designing medically supervised fasting techniques to extract better evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3588341" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mad-scientist.gif" alt="More science needs to be done on the difference in fasting results for men and women." width="480" height="230" /></p>
<p>Digging into the PubMed Archives brought me to the following conclusions <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-19" id="refmark-19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One small study (with 8 men and 8 women, all non-obese) resulted in the following:</strong> &#8220;Glucose response to a meal was slightly impaired in women after 3 weeks of treatment, but insulin response was unchanged. Men had no change in glucose response and a significant reduction in insulin response.&#8221;<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-20" id="refmark-20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Another small study (8 women) studied the effects on their menstrual cycles after a 72 hour fast &#8211;</strong> which is significantly longer than any fast recommended in this article: &#8220;in spite of profound metabolic changes, a 72-hour fast during the follicular phase does not affect the menstrual cycle of normal cycling women.&#8221; <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-21" id="refmark-21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Yet another study tracked 11 women with 72 hour fasts</strong> (again, longer than we&#8217;d recommend) and it found that &#8220;Fasting in women elicited expected metabolic responses &#8211; included increased cortisol (a stress hormone) &#8211; and apparently advanced the central circadian clock (which can throw off sleeping patterns). <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-22" id="refmark-22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>
<p>Those studies above, in working with small sample sizes, and different types of fasting than recommended here, would lead me to believe that fasting affects men and women differently, and that many of the weight loss benefits associated with intermittent fasting (that affect insulin and glucose responses) work positively for men and negatively for women.</p>
<p>There are also a series of articles<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-23" id="refmark-23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> out there that dig into the potential reproductive health issues, stress challenges, induction of early-menopause <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-24" id="refmark-24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> associated with fasting (and calorie restriction) for women.</p>
<p><strong>Precision Nutrition &#8211; a great resource &#8211; recommends not attempting Intermittent Fasting as a woman if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you’re pregnant</li>
<li>you have a history of disordered eating</li>
<li>you are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-nerds-guide-to-anxiety/">chronically stressed</a></li>
<li>you <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/are-you-making-these-mistakes-with-your-sleep/">don’t sleep well</a></li>
<li>you’re new to diet and exercise</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge associated with all of this is that there aren&#8217;t enough long-term studies, with large enough sample sizes, specifically targeting female humans, with relation to the different types of Intermittent Fasting.</p>
<p><strong>ALL OF THIS TO SAY: </strong>It does appear that men and women will have different experiences with intermittent fasting; we&#8217;re all unique snowflakes (yep, especially you), and your body will be affected by intermittent fasting differently than the person next to you.</p>
<p>There is enough evidence as cited in the articles and studies above that would give me pause to recommend Intermittent Fasting for women, especially if you are considering getting pregnant in the near term.</p>
<p>If you are looking to attempt fasting for weight loss reasons, my research has shown me that Intermittent Fasting could be less effective for women than men with regards to weight loss, and thus you would be wise to keep your efforts elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on the total calories and quality of your food (<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&#8217;s how to eat better</a>).</li>
<li>Start exercising regularly!</li>
<li>Make sure you are getting enough sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve read the above warnings, you are still curious about Intermittent Fasting, and you want to give it a try as a female, that is your choice!</p>
<p>You know your body best.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588389" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/old-school-film.gif" alt="You, like this woman, know your body best. So do what feels right when it comes to fasting." width="374" height="281" /></p>
<p>So, get blood work done, speak with your doctor and get a check-up.</p>
<p>Give intermittent fasting a shot, track your results, and see how your body/blood work changes as a result of Intermittent Fasting and decide if it&#8217;s right for you.</p>
<p><em>Your milage may vary, so speak with a doctor or find a doctor versed in intermittent fasting plans and treat it like an experiment on yourself!</em></p>

<h2><a name="questions_about_intermittent_fasting"></a>Top 6 Questions about Intermittent Fasting</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588432 size-large" title="Eat the right foods when practicing intermittent fasting!" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiwi-for-feast-during-intermittent-fasting-713x512.jpg" alt="When you feast during intermittent fasting, try to stick to real food like these kiwis!" width="713" height="512" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiwi-for-feast-during-intermittent-fasting-713x512.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiwi-for-feast-during-intermittent-fasting-300x215.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiwi-for-feast-during-intermittent-fasting-768x551.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiwi-for-feast-during-intermittent-fasting-600x431.jpg 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kiwi-for-feast-during-intermittent-fasting.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>1) &#8220;Won&#8217;t I get really hungry if I start skipping meals?&#8221;  </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As explained above, this can be a result of the habits you have built for your body. If you are constantly eating or always eat the same time of day, your body can actually learn to prepare itself for food by beginning the process of insulin production and preparation for food.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After a brief adjustment period, your body can adapt to the fact that it&#8217;s only eating a few times a day. The more overweight you are, and the more often you eat, the more of an initial struggle this might be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Remember, your body&#8217;s physical and cognitive abilities most likley won&#8217;t be diminished as a result of short term fasting.</em><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-25" id="refmark-25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>2) &#8220;Where will I get my energy for my workouts? Won&#8217;t I be exhausted and not be able to complete my workouts if fasting?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>This was a major concern of mine as well, but the research says otherwise: &#8220;Training with limited carbohydrate availability can stimulate adaptations in muscle cells to facilitate energy production via fat oxidation.&#8221;<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-26" id="refmark-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>
<p><em>In other words, when you train in a fasted state, your body can get better at burning fat for energy when there are no carbs to pull from!</em></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ll share some of my experiences, now doing heavy strength training for 3 years in a fasted state:</strong></p>
<p>For my first &#8220;fasted&#8221; workout or two after starting an IF protocol, it was very weird to not eat before training. However, after a few sessions, I learned that my body could certainly function (and even thrive) during my training sessions despite not eating a pre-workout meal.</p>
<p>Here I am pulling 420 lbs. at 172 BW after a 16 hour fast:</p>

<p><b>3) &#8220;I like the idea of fasted training, but I work a regular 9-5 or a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-stay-in-shape-despite-working-weird-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">night shift</a> and can&#8217;t train at 11AM like you do. What am I supposed to do?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Depending on your training schedule, lifestyle, and goals, go back to the portion above where I talk about the 16/8 protocol and simply adjust your hours of fasting and feasting.</p>
<p>LeanGains <a href="https://leangains.com/the-leangains-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digs into various options here</a>, but here is really what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t overthink this.</strong> If you can&#8217;t train until 5pm, that&#8217;s okay. Consume a small meal for lunch, or shift your Intermittent Fasting window to eat all of your meals in the 8 hours post workout. Better to do that than abandon it as a lost cause and have 0% compliance.</li>
<li><strong>If you are an elite athlete, speak with a coach or nutritionist about your specific concerns and expectations.</strong> Otherwise, make intermittent fasting work for you Consider trying the 24-hour protocol below instead of the 16/8 protocol.</li>
<li><strong>If you train later in the day (say, 7pm) but break your fast before training (aka Lunch),</strong> make it a smaller meal focused around fats and protein &#8211; which should be a solid goal even if you aren&#8217;t Intermittent Fasting! Try to time your carb and big meal consumption to happen AFTER your workout.</li>
<li><strong>If you exercise BEFORE work, but then don&#8217;t eat until lunchtime:</strong> consider a protein supplement immediately after your workout, or simply wait until lunch to start eating. See how your body responds and adjust accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do what you can, and don&#8217;t psyche yourself out! Get started and adjust along the way.</p>
<p><strong>4) &#8220;Won&#8217;t fasting cause muscle loss?&#8221;  </strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been told by the supplement industry that we need to consume 30 g of protein every few hours, as that&#8217;s the most amount of protein our body can process at a time.</p>
<p>Along with that, we&#8217;ve been told that if we don&#8217;t eat protein every few hours, our body&#8217;s muscle will start to break down to be burned as energy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Again, NOT TRUE! </strong>Our bodies are quite adept at preserving muscle even when fasting <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-27" id="refmark-27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>, and it turns out that <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protein absorption by our body</a> can take place over many many many hours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but you can even <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/lose-weight-and-build-muscle-or-do-one-then-the-other/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burn fat AND build muscle at the same time</a> if you have the right system in place! </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Protein consumed in a shorter period of time has no difference on the body compared to protein spread throughout the day.  <strong>  </strong></p>
<p><strong>5) &#8220;What about my body going into starvation mode from not eating?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>Now, the thought process here is that when we don&#8217;t feed ourselves, our bodies assume calories aren&#8217;t available and thus choose to store more calories as opposed to burning them, therefore eliminating the benefits of weight loss with fasting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3588345" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cartman-starving.gif" alt="Despite Cartman's concern, you won't enter starvation mode with intermittent fasting." width="384" height="270" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, this is NOT true.</p>
<p>Starvation mode is significantly overblown and sensationalized these days. It takes a dramatic amount of starvation, for a long, long, long time, before your body kicks into &#8220;starvation mode&#8221;. We&#8217;re talking about 24 hour or 16 hour fasts here, and starvation mode takes significantly longer than that.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-28" id="refmark-28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>
<p>In other words: starvation mode should not be factoring into your decision here.</p>
<p><strong>5) </strong><strong>How much should I eat while intermittent fasting? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Simple:</strong> Eat for your goals! <span style="font-weight: 400;">You do know <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how many calories you should eat every day</a>, right? </span></p>
<p>If your goal is weight loss, you still need to consume fewer calories than you burn every day to lose weight. If your goal is bulking up, you&#8217;ll need to consume more calories than you burn every day. Intermittent Fasting isn&#8217;t a cure-all, it&#8217;s a PART of the puzzle.</p>
<p>To start, begin intermittent fasting and eat your normal sized meals and track your weight and performance. If you are losing weight and happy with the progress, keep doing what you&#8217;re doing! If you are NOT losing weight, you could be eating too much. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a message I really strike home in our guide “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Can’t I Weight?</a>”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why you should </span>track your calories for a week, and then target a 10% reduction in calories and continue. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calculator for you to determine the amount of calories you need daily</a>.</span></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3588441" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hungry-ant-713x475.jpg" alt="This ant only practices intermittent fasting when it can't find food." width="713" height="475" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hungry-ant.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hungry-ant-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hungry-ant-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>#1) Don&#8217;t freak out! </strong>Stop wondering: &#8220;can I fast 15 hours instead of 16?&#8221; or &#8220;what if I eat an apple during my fasted period, will that ruin everything?&#8221; Relax. Your body is a complex piece of machinery and learns to adapt. Everything is not as cut and dry as you think.</p>
<p>If you want to eat breakfast one day but not another, that&#8217;s okay. If you are going for optimal aesthetic or athletic performance, I can see the need to be more rigid in your discipline, but otherwise&#8230;freaking chill out and don&#8217;t stress over minutiae!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588312" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/chill.gif" alt="This leopard knows that you'll be fine while doing intermittent fasting, just try it out and you'll be fine. " width="327" height="333" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good when it comes to your intermittent fasting plan.</p>
<p><strong>#2) Consider fasted walks in the morning. </strong>I found these to be very helpful in reducing body fat, and also gave my day a great start to clear my mind and prepare for the day.</p>
<p>Simply wake up and go for a mile walk. Maybe you could even start <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walking to Mordor</a>?</p>
<p><strong>#3) Listen to your body during your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training workouts</a>.</strong> If you get light headed, make sure you are consuming enough water.</p>
<p>If you notice a significant drop in performance, make sure you are eating enough calories (especially fats and protein) during your feasting window.</p>
<p>And if you feel severely &#8220;off,&#8221; pause your workout. Give yourself permission to EASE into intermittent fasting and fasted workouts. This is especially true if you are an endurance athlete.</p>
<p><strong>#4) Expect funny looks if you spend a lot of mornings with breakfast eaters.</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks back I had a number of friends staying with me, and they were all completely dumbfounded when I told them I didn&#8217;t eat breakfast anymore.</p>
<p>I tried to explain it to them but received a bunch of blank stares. Breakfast has become so enGRAINed (zing!) in our culture that NOT eating it sounds crazy.</p>
<p>You will get weird looks from those around you&#8230;<a title="Embrace it" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/01/05/what-if-im-the-only-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embrace it</a>. I still go to brunch or sit with friends, I just drink black coffee and enjoy a conversation.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.6316em;">#5) Stay busy. </strong><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;">If you are just sitting around thinking about how hungry you are, you&#8217;ll be more likely to struggle with this. For that reason, I time my fasting periods for maximum efficiency and minimal discomfort:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My first few hours of fasting come after consuming a MONSTER dinner, </strong>where the last thing I want to think about is eating.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 19px;"><strong>When I&#8217;m sleeping:</strong> 8 of my 16 hours are occupied by sleeping. Tough to feel hungry when I&#8217;m dreaming about becoming a Jedi.</span></li>
<li><strong>When I&#8217;m busy:</strong> After waking up, 12 hours of my fasting is already done. I spend three hours doing my best work (while drinking a cup of black coffee), and then comes my final hour of fasting: training.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>#6) Zero-calorie beverages are okay. </strong>I drink green tea in the morning for my <a title="caffeine kick" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/11/20/caffeine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caffeine kick </a>while writing. If you want to drink water, black coffee, or tea during your fasted period, that&#8217;s okay. Remember, don&#8217;t overthink it &#8211; keep things simple! Dr. Rhonda Patrick over at <a href="https://www.foundmyfitness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FoundMyFitness</a> believes that a fast should stop at the first consumption of anything other than water, so experiment yourself and see how your body responds.</p>
<p>If you want to put milk in your coffee, or drink diet soda occasionally while fasting, I&#8217;m not going to stop you. Remember, we&#8217;re going for consistency and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-build-healthy-habits-that-stick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">habit-building</a> here &#8211; if milk or cream in your coffee makes life worth living, don&#8217;t deprive yourself.</p>
<p>There are MUCH bigger fish to fry with regards to getting healthy than a few calories here and there during a fast.</p>
<p>80% adherence that you stick with for a year is better than 100% adherence that you abandon after a month because it was too restrictive.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to get to a minimum bodyfat percentage, you&#8217;ll need to be more strict &#8211; until then, however, do what allows you to stay compliant!</p>
<p><strong>#7) <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-track-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Track your results</a>, listen to your body:  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;"><strong>Concerned about losing muscle mass?</strong> Keep track of your <a title="strength training" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/rebel-strength-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training routines</a> and see if you are getting stronger.</span></li>
<li><strong>Buy a cheap set of <a title="body fat calipers" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VAPHXW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VAPHXW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nerdfitn-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">body fat calipers</a></strong> and keep track of your <a title="body fat composition" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/07/02/body-fat-percentage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">body fat composition</a>.</li>

<p>Everybody will react to an Intermittent Fasting Plan differently; I can&#8217;t tell you how your body will react. It&#8217;s up to you to listen to your body and see how making these adjustments change your body.</p>
<p><strong>#8) Don&#8217;t expect miracles. </strong>Yes, Intermittent Fasting can potentially help you lose weight, increase insulin sensitivity and growth hormone secretion (all good things), but it is only ONE factor in hundreds that will determine your body composition and overall health. Don&#8217;t expect to drop to 8% body fat and get ripped just by skipping breakfast.</p>
<p>We cover all of this in <span style="font-weight: 400;">our online self-paced course,</span> <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/">the NF Academy</a>, but you need to focus on <a title="building health habits" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/09/04/power-of-habit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building healthy habits</a>, <a title="eating better foods" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2010/10/04/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eating better foods</a>, and <a title="getting stronger" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/06/25/super-hero-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting stronger</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Intermittent fasting can potentially have some very positive benefits for somebody trying to lose weight or gain lean body mass.</strong></p>
<p>Men and women will tend to have different results, just like each individual person will have different results. The ONLY way to find out is <span style="font-weight: 400;">through a conversation with your doctor and </span>self-experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>There are multiple ways to &#8220;do&#8221; an Intermittent Fasting Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 19px;"><strong>Fast and feast regularly:</strong> Fast for a certain number of hours, then consume all calories within a certain number of hours.</span></li>
<li><strong>Eat normally, then fast 1-2x a week:</strong> Consume your normal meals every day, then pick one or two days a week where you fast for 24 hours. Eat your last meal Sunday night, and then don&#8217;t eat again until dinner the following day.</li>
<li><strong>Fast occasionally:</strong> probably the easiest method for the person who wants to do the least amount of work. Simply skip a meal whenever it&#8217;s convenient. On the road? Skip breakfast. Busy day at work? Skip lunch. Eat poorly all day Saturday? Make your first meal of the day dinner on Sunday.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>After that, get started! </b>Take photos, step on the scale, and track your progress for the next month.</p>
<p>See how your body responds.</p>
<p>See how your physique changes. See how your workouts change.</p>
<p>And then decide if it&#8217;s something you want to keep doing!</p>
<p>4 years later, I have no plans on going back to eating breakfast. Sorry General Mills and Dr. Kellogg!</p>

<h2><a name="what_is_paleo_diet"></a>What is the Paleo Diet and How does it Work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-3574945 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-caveman-solo-narrow.jpg" alt="This LEGO Caveman wants to learn more about the Paleo Diet too" width="709" height="302" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-caveman-solo-narrow.jpg 709w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-caveman-solo-narrow-300x128.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-caveman-solo-narrow-600x256.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Oh lord, another “diet.”</strong></p>
<p>I know, it sounds like a fad/marketing ploy, but The Paleo Diet isn&#8217;t really a &#8220;diet,&#8221; and it&#8217;s actually quite logical when you think about it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the most time-tested diet ever.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the ENTIRE diet in a nutshell:</p>
<p>&#8220;If a cave person didn&#8217;t eat it, neither should you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the theory goes, tens of thousands of years ago, before Nike, Cap’n Crunch, and Healthy Choice meals, our ancient ancestors thrived as hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>Although it’s been a really long time, our genetics haven’t changed that much since then.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230;these days we&#8217;re overweight, out of shape, stressed out, unhappy, sleep deprived and dying from far too many preventable diseases due to lifestyle choices.</p>
<p><strong>So what the hell happened?</strong></p>
<p>Agriculture!</p>
<p>And then delivery and Netflix.</p>
<p>A few thousand years ago, humans discovered farming, the agricultural revolution took off, and we advanced from hunter-gatherers to farmers.</p>
<p>We settled down, formed societies, and the human race progressed to what we are today. Which is obviously great for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not getting eaten by wild animals</li>
<li>Electricity</li>
<li>Automobiles</li>
<li>Nintendo</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The problem is that our bodies never adjusted properly to eating all the grains and sugar that we’re now consuming.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As paleo guru <a href="https://robbwolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Wolf</a> puts it, think of a 100-yard football field:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The first 99.5 yards are how long Homo-Sapiens spent as hunter-gatherers. As they became REALLY good at hunting and gathering our bodies adapted to that lifestyle over thousands of years.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That last half-yard represents our species after the agricultural revolution, where our diet has shifted (but our genetics haven’t).</p>
<p>So, instead of loading up on meat, vegetables and seasonal fruits, we’ve become a species “dependent” upon grains – bread, pasta, rice, corn, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>66% of us are overweight, 33% are considered obese, and those numbers are only getting worse.</strong><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Clearly something&#8217;s not right, and we need to fix it.</p>
<p>The Paleo Diet is an effort to go back to our ancestral roots.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574977" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/caveman-lizard.gif" alt="Okay, so cavemen probably didn't probably ride giant dinosaurs" width="410" height="227" /></p>
<p>To start eating how we&#8217;re biologically designed to eat, allowing us to tap into our genetic potential and start living healthier immediately.</p>
<p><strong>To recap the rules of the Paleo Diet:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Only eat foods a caveman would eat</li>
<li>See Rule #1</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that it doesn&#8217;t mention calorie counting or meal timing or macro tracking. That&#8217;s part of the popularity of this diet: eat paleo approved foods when you&#8217;re hungry, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<h2><a name="weight_loss_on_paleo_diet"></a>Will I Lose Weight on the Paleo Diet?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13303 size-full" title="Leaning Caveman Grok" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Leaning-Caveman-Grok.jpg" alt="This LEGO caveman is taking a break from eating Paleo" width="590" height="347" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Leaning-Caveman-Grok.jpg 590w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Leaning-Caveman-Grok-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p><strong>This is the question we get above all else:</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Will the Paleo Diet help me lose weight?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Probably. <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can actually apply the rules of the Paleo lifestyle, you can get some pretty solid results.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Paleo Diet will work for you, if you do it right.</strong></p>
<p>You need to have the right mindset, you need to focus on the right foods, and you need to structure your environment so that you&#8217;re not tempted to backslide and abandon the Paleo Diet after a few days.</p>
<p><strong>However, it has nothing to do with what Fred Flintstone ate or didn&#8217;t eat.</strong></p>
<p>It comes down to science and thermodynamics.</p>
<p>As I point out in our article on <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Lose Weight: What&#8217;s the Perfect Diet (For me?)</a>, if you want to lose weight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eat fewer calories than you burn every day.</li>
<li>Want to also be healthy? Eat mostly real food.</li>
</ol>
<p>Want to KEEP the weight off?</p>
<p>Add #3: Do those two things consistently for a decade.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s WHY you&#8217;ll lose weight on the Paleo Diet: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re only eating meat, fish, veggies, fruits, and nuts.</strong> These are foods that are full of nutrients, will make you feel full, but don&#8217;t have nearly as many calories as junk food.</li>
<li><strong>You are completely eliminating calorie-dense, often nutritionally deficient, unhealthy foods</strong>. This means no grains (pasta, bread, rice), no dairy, no beans. It also means no soda, no candy, no sugar.</li>
</ol>
<p>And yup. When you only eat real food and avoid all unhealthy food, you&#8217;re more likely than not going to run a caloric deficit &#8211; and thus lose weight.</p>
<p>Let me share a really obvious example.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-200-calories-look-like.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">200 calories of broccoli</a> gets you enough to fill up an entire plate:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574949 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli.jpg" alt="200 calories of paleo approved broccoli " width="605" height="403" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli.jpg 605w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p>
<p><b>Or&#8230; 200 calories will get you exactly 1/2 a Snickers bar:</b></p>

<p><strong>Look at that:</strong> nobody can eat that much broccoli, and nobody only eats half a candy bar!</p>
<p>My point is this: by eating Paleo-approved foods, you&#8217;re more likely than not to eat fewer calories than you did in the past automatically, which can lead to weight loss.</p>
<p>I dig into this in even greater detail in &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why can&#8217;t I lose weight?</a>&#8221; but it all comes down to &#8220;calories in, calories out.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>So YES, the Paleo Diet MIGHT help you lose weight.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just need to eat fewer calories than you burn every day (Here&#8217;s how to calculate your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Daily Energy Expenditure</a>). And that is easier when you are eliminating foods that people tend to overeat:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Candy</li>
<li>Soda</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Dairy</li>
</ul>
<p>But that&#8217;s all about what we&#8217;re eliminating. What are we keeping!?</p>

<p><b>In order to follow the Paleo Diet Lifestyle, here are the foods that are Paleo approved:</b></p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Organs</strong> &#8211; liver, kidneys, heart.</li>
<li><strong>Marrows</strong> &#8211; seeing a theme here? Eat ALL parts of the animal!</li>
<li><strong>Fowl </strong>&#8211; chicken, duck, hen, turkey…things with wings that (try to) fly.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>*If you can, aim for grass-fed beef and organic fruits and vegetables. But don&#8217;t go break the bank with your food purchases. Just do the best you can. </em></p>
<p>As the Paleo Diet explains: Pick any of the foods from that list and eat as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that a lot of the foods above are loaded with fat. And depending on what your mom told you growing up, you might think fat is the devil.</p>
<p>So let me address that right away&#8230;</p>
<h2>Does Eating Fat Make You Fat?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574951 size-full" title="chef and lego pig" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/chef-and-pig.jpg" alt="This pig will make a tasty paleo meal." width="590" height="379" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/chef-and-pig.jpg 590w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/chef-and-pig-300x193.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p><b>If you’re cutting back on carbs, that means you’ll need to fill the void in your diet with the most controversial macronutrient:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fat!</span></p>
<p>It’s gotten a bad rap over the past number of decades, so companies have been doing everything possible to make everything low fat and “healthy!” (while adding all sorts of preservatives, chemicals, and sugar).</p>
<p>Yup…cut out the fat, increase the carbs….and look where THAT has gotten us.</p>
<p><strong>Why has fat been vilified?</strong> Rather than get into the politics of it myself, I’ll let Gary Taubes, author of the incredibly thorough and well-researched <em>Good Calories, Bad Calories</em> take over.</p>
<p>As he discusses in an article he wrote for the New York Times a decade ago:<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>These researchers point out that there are plenty of reasons to suggest that the low-fat-is-good-health hypothesis has now effectively failed the test of time. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In particular, that we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic that started around the early 1980&#8217;s, and that this was coincident with the rise of the low-fat dogma. (Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, also rose significantly through this period.) </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>They say that low-fat weight-loss diets have proved in clinical trials and real life to be dismal failures, and that on top of it all, the percentage of fat in the American diet has been decreasing for two decades. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our cholesterol levels have been declining, and we have been smoking less, and yet the incidence of heart disease has not declined as would be expected. &#8221;That is very disconcerting,&#8221; Willett says. &#8221;It suggests that something else bad is happening.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Low fat&#8221; foods were created to follow conventional wisdom that fat made you fat (which as stated in the above article doesn&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny).</p>
<p>When a company makes a low fat food, they remove the fat and have to replace the flavor with something.</p>
<p>That &#8220;something&#8221; is usually sugar (and often more calories).</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574981 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sad-panda.gif" alt="This panda is sad and trying to avoid sugar" width="250" height="250" /></p>
<p>So, according to Taubes and Paleo folks, fat has been vilified and the real focus should have been on sugar and carbs all along.</p>
<p><strong>Because healthy fats are valuable additions to our diet. </strong></p>
<p>Here are some examples of Paleo-Approved Healthy Fats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avocados</li>
<li>Almond (and almond butter)</li>
<li>Fatty cuts of meat</li>
<li>Walnuts</li>
<li>Coconut oil</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Paleo Diet, fat makes up a large portion of one&#8217;s diet.</p>

<h2><a name="restrictions_on_paleo_diet"></a>WhAT Foods Can&#8217;t I eat On the Paleo Diet?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13301 size-full" title="Cavemen Hunt Paleo Bear" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cavemen-Hunt-Paleo-Bear.jpg" alt="Two LEGO Cavemen hunt a bear, paleo style" width="590" height="383" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cavemen-Hunt-Paleo-Bear.jpg 590w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cavemen-Hunt-Paleo-Bear-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p><b>If you are looking to strictly follow the Paleo Diet, then you can’t eat foods that did not exist back in &#8220;Caveman times.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because – as advocates of the diet point out – cavemen couldn’t eat those foods because they didn’t exist. There was no way to create cereal and candy &#8211; you could only eat what you found or hunted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, that’s what the Paleo Diet advocates as the reason for avoiding these foods. And it serves as a good mental model to check with yourself: “Could a caveman have eaten this meal?”</span></p>
<p><b>And when you start to answer this question, you identify the foods that you’re not allowed to eat on the Paleo Diet:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grains like pasta, cereal bread, and rice</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dairy like milk and cheese</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candy, cookies, ice cream, and other processed foods</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Paleo Diet also almost completely eliminates sugar outside of fruit. No candy. No soda. No powdered donuts. Yup, even the mini white ones from the grocery store where you can eat like 100 of them (accidentally, of course).</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that an incredible number of diseases and lifestyle issues can be reversed by cutting out sugar and processed foods.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> </p>
<p>But I understand grains and dairy are a bit more complex.</p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<h2><a name="grains_on_paleo_diet"></a>Can I Eat Grains on the Paleo Diet?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574954 size-full" title="Darth vader vendor lego" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vader-and-chef.jpg" alt="Darth Vader buying a sausage from a street vendor.

<p><b>Unfortunately, nope.</b></p>
<p><strong>The Caveman reason why:</strong> Grains require some amount of processing, and thus Cavemen would not have eaten them.</p>
<p><strong>The science and psychological reason why: </strong>we have a tendency to overeat grains and the other &#8220;no no&#8221; foods on the Paleo Diet. They are calorically dense, nutrient deficient, and they can wreak havoc on some people&#8217;s blood sugar levels.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leads to a sugar rush followed by a crash, w</span>hich can lead to more emotional or hungry overeating&#8230;and the process starts again.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than me explain that part with thousands of words, just watch this three-minute video &#8211; &#8220;Why You Got Fat:&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="Why You Got Fat" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNYlIcXynwE?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s get into some more reasons Paleo advocates suggest avoiding grains: most contain <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-gluten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gluten</a> and lectins. </strong></p>
<p>What are they and what&#8217;s wrong with them? I&#8217;m so glad you asked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gluten is a protein found in things like rye, wheat, and barley.</strong> It’s now being said that much of our population may be gluten-intolerant (hence all the new “gluten-free!” items popping up everywhere). Over time, those who are gluten intolerant can develop a dismal array of medical conditions from consuming gluten: dermatitis, joint pain, reproductive problems, acid reflux, and more.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> </li>
<li><strong>Lectins are natural toxins that exist in grains to defend against consumption! </strong>Yup. Grains have evolved to keep themselves from being eaten by us. These lectins are not a fan of our gastrointestinal tract, and they prevent the tract from repairing itself from normal wear and tear. This can cause all kinds of damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Long story short: many people cannot process grains properly, and they are usually the food that causes people to eat too many calories. </b>So by eliminating grains from your diet, you&#8217;re more likely than not going to eat fewer calories without counting calories.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a Paleo win!</p>

<h2><b>Do I Need to Avoid Carbs on the Paleo Diet?</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13305 size-full" title="Lego vs Bread and Carbs" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Lego-vs-Bread-Carbs.jpg" alt="Lego man is deciding whether or not to cut bread from his diet.

<p><b>Not necessarily. </b></p>
<p><b>That depends on your goals and your body &#8211; you are a special snowflake!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people function well on a high fat, low carb diet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others function better on a high carb, low fat diet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I function better on a higher carb, lower fat diet (<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/losing-the-last-20-pounds-7-lessons-learned-while-still-eating-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is how I lost 22 pounds in 6 months</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say the Paleo Diet is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">USUALLY</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Low Carb diet, and large quantities of carbs are not required for somebody to be healthy regular diet.</span><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>After all, carbs aren&#8217;t evil &#8211; they&#8217;re just&#8230;carbs.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the logic and psychology behind why the Paleo Diet is low carb:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a typical Western diet, we consume plenty o&#8217; carbs, and our bodies convert those carbs to a sugar called “glucose.” This is our body’s preferred method of fueling itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>In the absence of carbs to create glucose to fuel our bodies, we have to do a few other things instead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transform stored fat into glycerol and fatty acids (this process is called lipolysis).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burn fatty acids for energy or transform the fatty acids into glucose for energy (this is called gluconeogenesis)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of glucose (through <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fasting</a> or following a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-keto-diet-or-ketogenic-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keto Diet</a>), your body can create ketones for fuel (called “ketogenesis”).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re going to focus on the forms of weight loss NOT related to &#8220;ketogenesis.&#8221; Unless you are avoiding all carbohydrates while going Paleo, or you are doing long fasts, you most likely <i>won’t</i> be in ketosis while going Paleo.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do cover <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-paleo-diet-vs-keto-diet-3-lessons-learned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleo vs Keto: Which is Better</a> if you&#8217;re deciding between the two.</span></em></p>
<p>Back to weight loss and Paleo: when you cut back on carbs, and thus most likely ALSO cut back on total calories consumed, you are creating a caloric deficit in your body.</p>
<p><strong>And eat a consistent deficit over a long enough time period, BOOM caveman weight loss.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, fewer carbs = less glucose in your system, less sugar crashes, less “hangry” moments and smaller chance of overeating = fewer calories consumed on average.</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about adherence to the diet, I understand &#8211; it&#8217;s the toughest part of Paleo &#8211; sticking with it!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3574983 aligncenter" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sabrina.gif" alt="The paleo diet can be tricky to follow, as Sabrina knows. " width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>Knowing what to eat is part of it, but following this fairly restrictive lifestyle in a modern environment surrounded by cookies and candy and bagels and pasta is really difficult!</p>

<p><strong><b>This also depends. Strict </b>Paleo folks tend to stay away from it</strong> &#8211; a portion of the world is lactose intolerant, and those that aren’t usually have at least some type of an aversion to it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because hunter-gatherers didn’t lug cows around with them while traveling – milk was consumed as a baby through breast milk from their mother, and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as Paleo-stans will tell ya, </span>our bodies weren’t designed for massive dairy consumption.</p>
<p>There is evidence that some adaptation to dairy has taken place throughout the years, specifically with people with ancestry in herding cultures, but this is not the majority of the population.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-6" id="refmark-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<p>Paleo purists will avoid dairy like the plague, while other paleo-ish people have found that consuming dairy in its various forms work for their genetics, goals, and lifestyle.</p>
<p><b><a name="cheese_on_paleo_diet"></a>“What about Cheese? Can I eat cheese on the Paleo Diet?”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do you, boo. But if you’re going Strict Paleo, then unfortunately cheese is OUT too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re just looking to lose some weight while following a “mostly Paleo” lifestyle, then adding some high quality cheese into some of your meals can be okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some cheeses will tend to have lower amounts of lactose or casein &#8211; the parts of dairy that can cause digestion challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you’re not sure your body is processing dairy properly, remove dairy from your diet and only introduce it back in when you’re ready to see how your body responds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not losing weight</a> while eating a &#8220;Paleo + Dairy&#8221; Diet, you’re still eating too many calories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider cutting out dairy and see how your body responds.</span></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574959 size-full" title="storm trooper tomato" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/stormtrooper-lego.jpg" alt="A Lego Storm trooper wants to know if a pepper part of a paleo diet?" width="590" height="274" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/stormtrooper-lego.jpg 590w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/stormtrooper-lego-300x139.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p><b>Here is an example of a typical day on “The Paleo Diet”:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Breakfast: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omelet with spinach with fresh fruit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lunch: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grilled chicken, kale, and avocado salad with vinegar and olive oil.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Snack:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apple slices and almond butter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Dinner:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Steak with asparagus and sweet potato fries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Dessert:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Strawberries and a piece of 85% dark chocolate.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t sound so bad, right? </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you check out our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/category/paleo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleo Diet Recipes and Resources</a> section too for more options. </span></p>
<p>Start with a good protein source with each meal (eggs, steak, chicken, fish, pork) and then add a vegetable or fruit.</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p><b>If you feel hungry constantly, understand that changing up a diet can cause a body a few weeks of adjustment.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, your body is learning to operate on both fewer calories AND fewer carbs &#8211; depending on how low carb you go this could be a DRAMATIC change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is often referred to as “carb flu,” and it can be miserable! Your body might take </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> weeks to adjust to these new habits.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574987 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/the-flu.gif" alt="No one likes the carb flu, especially Ben Wyatt" width="245" height="283" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going from a processed, high sodium diet to a paleo diet you will very often end up eating too little sodium, which is an essential nutrient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f you’re feeling tired all the time, try adding some salt to your food or consider an electrolyte supplement &#8211; this is what we recommend with our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-keto-diet-or-ketogenic-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keto readers</a> too. </span></p>
<h2><a name="dangers_of_paleo_diet"></a>Is the Paleo Diet Dangerous?</h2>
<div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13302 size-full" title="Frozen Caveman Grok Lego: Could he eat Paleo in Modern Times?" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Frozen-Caveman-Grok.jpg" alt="A LEGO Caveman frozen in ice, wondering if the Paleo Diet is dangerous" width="590" height="392" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Frozen-Caveman-Grok.jpg 590w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Frozen-Caveman-Grok-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p><strong>The dismissive criticisms of the Paleo Diet generally fall into one of three categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cavemen had short lifespans. So there.</li>
<li>A recent article said that cavemen ate grains. So there.</li>
<li>Eating that much meat is unhealthy. So there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As I said at the beginning of this article, it doesn&#8217;t matter what cavemen or cavewomen ACTUALLY ate.</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-3523953 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DoesntMatter.gif" alt="The Rock doesn't care if it's paleo or not." width="496" height="248" /></p>
<p>The reason this diet works has nothing to do with what our bodies are designed to eat or what cavemen ate 1,000s of years ago.</p>
<p>The Paleo Diet CAN help you lose weight because it gets you to cut out junk food, focus on eating real food, and gives you a framework to evaluate quickly every food choice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did a caveman eat this? Yes or no.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>By following this ONE rules, you&#8217;re <em>likely</em> to eat fewer calories than you used to, and thus you&#8217;re likely to end up healthier than before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/losing-the-last-20-pounds-7-lessons-learned-while-still-eating-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I personally don&#8217;t follow a Paleo Diet</a>, but I do appreciate the fact that it&#8217;s easy to comprehend and gets people to take a more active approach in their food!</p>
<p><strong>So, disregarding the fear mongering, dogma, and anthropological criticisms of what cavemen actually ate, what are the ACTUAL critiques of the Paleo Diet?</strong></p>
<p><strong>#1) &#8220;Why is the Paleo Diet expensive?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Admittedly, while I recommend eating organic fruits and veggies, free-range chicken, and grass-fed beef whenever possible, these products can be more expensive in conventional stores due to the processes needed to get them there.</p>
<p>However, farmers’ markets often have well-priced meats, eggs, fruits, and vegetables that are locally grown and incredibly healthy.</p>
<p>Even if you’re spending a little more money than before, when you factor in your overall health, spending a few extra bucks on healthier food now is a wiser investment than thousands later on costly medical expenses.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re really short on cash, eating the non-organic or grain-fed version of a meat, vegetable, or eggs is still better than eating breads, pasta, fast food, and the like.</p>
<p>Most people simply compare the cost of a paleo meal with ramen noodles or pasta and bread and determine Paleo is prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s more expensive than those foods, but if you are smart with your money you can eat a much healthier meal and do so pretty inexpensively. Check out this guide on &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-eat-healthy-without-breaking-the-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Eat Healthy Without Breaking the Bank</a>&#8221; for some tips and tricks.</p>
<p><em>(This doesn&#8217;t even factor in the whole &#8220;if you eat cheap unhealthy food now, you&#8217;ll pay thousands in medical bills and hospital visits and medications later&#8221; argument which is valid too).</em></p>
<p><strong>#2) &#8220;But cavemen had short lifespans! Of course they don&#8217;t have the diseases we do. We live way longer now.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I agree with you here, but only because you don’t have to deal with the dangers of living back then. Again we don&#8217;t really care to live like cave people!</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIMPLY a construct</a> that can help many make more informed food choices.</p>
<p><strong>#3) &#8220;Plenty of societies around the world consume grains and aren’t fat and unhealthy like us.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome &#8211; it seems like those people have found a solution that works for them. Have you read our big ass guide to eating a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-eat-a-plant-based-diet-a-scientific-look-at-going-vegan-safely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plant-Based Diet</a>?</span></p>
<p><em>The China Study</em> is frequently cited when criticizing the Paleo Diet – focusing on a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-eat-a-plant-based-diet-a-scientific-look-at-going-vegan-safely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegetarian diet</a> and consuming rice is healthier than the Paleo Diet. I respectfully disagree with the conclusions drawn from that book but that&#8217;s awesome if you want to<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-eat-a-plant-based-diet-a-scientific-look-at-going-vegan-safely/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> go plant-based</a>! <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-7" id="refmark-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> I&#8217;ll leave you to make your own conclusions based on your own self-experimentation.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re here to learn about the Paleo Diet though, so let&#8217;s keep the focus there.</p>
<p><strong>#4) &#8220;But this is just a meat diet, and eating all meat is bad!&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>First of all, consider your sources and do your research before jumping to the conclusions.</p>
<p>Next, this is not an <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/should-you-try-the-carnivore-diet-5-questions-addressed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all meat diet like the Carnivore Diet</a> or uber-low carb diets like <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-keto-diet-or-ketogenic-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keto</a> or Atkins. The biggest component of the Paleo Diet?</p>
<p><em>Vegetables!</em></p>
<p>Every meal in a true Paleo diet has a moderate amount of healthy (properly raised chicken, grass-fed beef, hormone free, etc.) meat combined with nutritious veggies or a moderate amount of fruit.</p>
<p><strong>#5) &#8220;The Paleo Diet is too restrictive and I can&#8217;t live like this.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>This is the most valid criticism I personally have of the diet, as <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best diet plan</a> is the one you actually stick with and follow through on! The goal shouldn&#8217;t be to go &#8220;full paleo&#8221; for a few weeks only to go back to how you were eating before.</p>
<p>Instead, the goal here should be to rethink your relationship with food and develop a strategy that you can live with permanently.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing worse than going on diets and gaining and losing the same 20 pounds over and over. The Paleo Diet, like other diets, WORKS ONLY IF YOU STICK WITH IT PERMANENTLY!</p>
<p>This makes sense after all: make temporary changes, get temporary results, right?</p>
<p><strong>#6) &#8220;Steve, I hate vegetables. <b>How do you make vegetables taste better?</b> HALP.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I got you. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/vegetable-haters-how-to-start-eating-vegetables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heres how to start liking vegetables and how to make vegetables taste better</a>.</p>
<p>We know this all too well, and we have helped thousands of people slowwwwly transition their diet over a long period of time to make change less scary, more permanent, and thus make the weight loss permanent too!</p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/category/easy-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full list of Nerd Fitness Paleo/Healthy recipes</a>, and here are my three favorites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/category/easy-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Minutes of Prep, 10 Easy Meals</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Paleo spaghetti" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/2012/02/21/how-to-cook-paleo-spaghetti/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleo spaghetti</a>: freaking delicious, I promise</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-make-mini-paleo-pizzas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>How to Make Mini Paleo Pizzas.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve also compiled a list of my favorite sites and recipe books around the internet that can help you get started:</strong></p>
<p><strong>#1) <a href="http://www.nomnompaleo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nom Nom Paleo &#8211;</a></strong> Michelle Tam and her husband Henry are amazing people, and their Paleo Blog is absolutely phenomenal. Great photos. Well written. Organized intelligently.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Their <a href="https://amzn.to/2CtxRvx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Nom Nom Paleo&#8221; cookbook</a> is a fun resource too, and a great place to get started with cooking for your Paleo lifestyle. Oh, what&#8217;s that? You have kids and a spouse and you&#8217;re all trying to eat healthier too? This book is perfect for that as well!</p>
<p><strong>#2) </strong><a title="Marks Daily Apple" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mark&#8217;s Daily Apple </strong></a>&#8211; Easily the most comprehensive resource on the internet for the Paleo Diet – Mark writes an article every weekday about everything Paleo, and it usually blows me away. Some of the posts can get overwhelming, so I suggest starting with his <a title="Primal Blueprint" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-blueprint-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primal Blueprint 101</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a title="Primal Blueprint" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207700?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nerdfitn-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0982207700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Primal Blueprint</a> &#8211; If you want to read about this stuff in a book rather than on a computer screen, Mark’s book <em>The Primal Blueprint</em> is a great place to get started on not only what to eat, but why you should be eating it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It’s educational, funny, real-world applicable, and teaches you how to primalize (just made that up) the rest of your life too.</p>
<p><strong>#3) <a title="Robb Wolf" href="http://robbwolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robb Wolf</a> </strong>&#8211; Another great resource, and a guy I’ve already referenced in this article multiple times. Check out his site for a <a title="FAQ" href="http://robbwolf.com/faq/">comprehensive FAQ</a> on all things Paleo, a <a href="http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/shopping-list.pdf">shopping list pdf</a> (right-click and save), and plenty of humor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a title="Paleo Solution" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982565844?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nerdfitn-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0982565844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Paleo Solution</a> &#8211; This article would have been finished 3 hours earlier, but before I wrote it, I read ALL of Robb’s new book. It seriously had me laughing out loud at certain points – not bad for a book on diet!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This book is a little less forgiving than Mark’s book above, but it’s still a great read.</p>
<p><strong>#4) <a title="Loren Cordain" href="http://www.thepaleodiet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loren Cordain</a></strong> &#8211; Loren is considered the leading expert on the Paleo Diet – Robb is actually one of his students/disciples/Padawans.</p>
<p>Dr. Cordain is probably the foremost authority on this type of eating, which is why I really enjoyed reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2EXCluB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both of his books</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MORE RECIPE RESOURCES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://amzn.to/2O4bIse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ready or Not! 150 Make Now Recipes</a> &#8211; </b>The newer book from Michelle Tam of Nom Nom Paleo. It&#8217;s super fun. Plus she&#8217;s wearing a Nerd FItness t-shirt in some of her photos in the book, so I might be sliiiightly biased 🙂</li>
<li><strong><a style="line-height: 1.6316em;" title="MDA" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-blueprint-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark’s Daily Apple</a></strong><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;"> – Although he sells the cookbook on Amazon, Mark also lists over 100 free primal recipes on his site. Pick something on the list, go buy the ingredients, and follow the instructions! So easy even a caveman can do it.</span></li>
<li><strong><a style="line-height: 1.6316em;" title="Everyday Paleo" href="http://everydaypaleo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Everyday Paleo</a></strong><span style="line-height: 1.6316em;"> – Great pictures, easy to follow recipes, and pretty interesting combinations. Click on FOOD in the Nav bar, and the meals are broken down into breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>I’m a fan of the Paleo Diet for the RIGHT person: </b></p>
<p>I love mental models that help us make sense of the world, and I think for SOME people, the Paleo Diet will really help them cut down on overeating.</p>
<p>I personally do NOT follow a Paleo Diet, but <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I do have rules that I follow</a>.</p>
<p>Do whatever makes you happy and fits in your schedule. I like this kind of stress-free eating.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not grains should be vilified, I love this diet because I know it WORKS. I know people that have lost incredible amounts of weight and changed their lives within a matter of months.</p>
<p><strong>People like <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/">Staci</a>:</strong></p>

<p>Regardless of how you feel about grains, we can all agree that eating more natural foods and less processed foods is better for you.</p>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD DO THE PALEO DIET IF:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You struggle with portion control (meaning you can&#8217;t eat just one cookie, or you tend to keep eating even when you&#8217;re full).</li>
<li>You can stick with the changes you&#8217;re making permanently! Remember, temporary changes create temporary results.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t mind eliminating some of your favorite foods completely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOU SHOULD NOT DO THE PALEO DIET IF:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of giving up non-paleo foods makes you want to cry.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t mind learning about calories and want to track your food.</li>
<li>Another diet sounds like a better fit for you!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider some of these other options instead: </strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If you want to lose weight and keep it off, you need to make permanent adjustments to your nutrition.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t see yourself being able to permanently follow a Paleo Diet, I would advise a more &#8216;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wade in from the shallow end</a>&#8216; approach to dietary change!</p>

<p><strong>Maybe you’re ready to try out this Paleo lifestyle, but you can’t commit fully. </strong>There are certain foods you refuse to give up, or you can’t afford to buy grass-fed beef at the moment.</p>
<p>That’s okay!</p>
<p>If you can even make a few small changes here and there (cut out liquid calories, switch out your rice for steamed vegetables, cut back on bread, etc.) you’ll start to see some changes.</p>
<p><em>Remember, 20% healthier is better than 0% healthier – as you get more comfortable with the changes you can increase that percentage.</em></p>
<p><b>After all, I know how tough it is to stay loyal to a strict diet, especially without a plan to follow.</b> It&#8217;s why we created free resources that can help you reach your goals faster without you also going crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Get rid of the temptation: </strong>if you’re gonna go at this thing with a full head of steam, remove all the junk food from your house.</p>
<p>It’s going to take a few weeks for your body to adjust to burning fat instead of glucose, and you might want to eat poorly here and there. If there’s no food in your house to tempt you, it will be much easier to stay on target.</p>
<p><strong>Now, it&#8217;s your turn.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried the Paleo Diet yet?</li>
<li>What was your experience like?</li>
<li>Have a criticism of the diet that I didn’t cover before?</li>
<li>Do you have a favorite paleo resource?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember, one of the major <a title="rules of the rebellion" href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/about-2/rules-of-the-rebellion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rules of the Rebellion</a> is to question everything!</strong></p>
<p>I hope this article gives you some food for thought (terrible pun, I know), and gives you permission to question conventional wisdom and start addressing the issues in your diet!</p>

<p><strong>When it comes to push-ups, your form is crucial.</strong> Each push-up needs to be done with proper form so that your total reps measured from workout to workout are on equal footing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3583748" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/push-up.gif" alt="This gif shows Staci doing a push-up in perfect form." width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>If you did 20 push-ups two days ago, and then today you did 25 push-ups by only going down halfway, sticking your ass up in the air, etc., it&#8217;s absolutely impossible to tell if you got any stronger.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3583873 size-full" title="Screen shot 2011-02-15 at 11.36.38 PM" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-side.png" alt="Another angle of showing how to setup a proper push-up." width="687" height="352" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-side.png 687w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-side-300x154.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-side-600x307.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></p>
<p><b>Here’s how to get into proper push-up position:</b></p>
<p><strong>1) On the ground, set your hands at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. </strong></p>
<p>Draw a straight line from your chest/nipple down to the floor &#8211; it should be directly over your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Depending on your strength and experience, your hands should be angled in a way that feels comfortable to you. For me, my hands are set up so that my middle finger points straight up and away from me.</p>
<p><strong>2) To alleviate wrist pain</strong> (if you have <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-wrist-mobility-and-grip-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poor wrist flexibility</a>) do your push-ups holding onto push-up handles (so your wrists aren&#8217;t as compromised), or a bar (see Staci&#8217;s video below doing elevated push-ups for example).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re hardcore, you can do them on your knuckles (as long as you&#8217;re on a semi-soft surface like grass or carpet<span style="font-weight: 400;"> or broken glass. Wait, scratch that last one</span>).</p>
<p><strong>3) Your feet should be set up in a way that feels right and comfortable and in balance.</strong> For some, that might be shoulder width apart.</p>
<p>For others, it might be with your feet touching. Generally speaking, the wider apart your feet, the more stable you&#8217;ll be for your push-ups.</p>
<p><strong>4) Think of your body as one giant straight line </strong>– from the top of your head down through your heels. Your butt shouldn’t be sticking way up in the air or sagging. <span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re essentially holding a plank throughout the entire movement. </span></p>
<p><strong>5) If you have a problem getting the proper form with your body, try this: </strong>clench your butt, and then tighten your abs as if you&#8217;re bracing to get punched.</p>
<p>Your core will be engaged, and your body should be in that straight line. If you’ve been doing push-ups incorrectly, this might be a big change for you.</p>
<p>Record a video of yourself to make sure you&#8217;re doing it correctly.</p>
<p><strong>6) Your head should be looking slightly ahead of you, not straight down</strong> (yeah I know I&#8217;m looking straight down in my top picture, I hadn&#8217;t started yet!).</p>
<p>I read somewhere that said “if you’re doing them right, your chin should be the first part of your head to touch the floor, not your nose.”</p>
<p>Looking up helps you keep your body in line, but feel free to look down if that helps you concentrate more.</p>
<p><strong>7) At the top of your push-up, your arms should be straight and supporting your weight.</strong> You’re now ready to do a push-up.</p>
<p><b>8) I want to draw special attention to that first step with hand position: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly EVERYBODY does push-ups with their arms out far too wide and their shoulders flared. This is bad news bears. </span></p>
<p><strong>If I was looking down at you from above, your arms and body should form an ARROW, not a T.</strong></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you have been doing push-ups with your arms flared, doing them with proper form will be significantly more difficult!</span></em></p>

<p><strong><b>In the 5 minute &#8220;Perfect Push-Up&#8221; video above,</b> featuring yours truly and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two of our coaches</a>, to take you through EACH of the steps of a push-up, including some variations!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s how to complete one perfect repetition of a proper push up:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With your arms straight, butt clenched, and abs braced,</strong> steadily lower yourself until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle or less. Depending on your level of experience, age, and flexibility, 90 degrees might be the lowest you’re able to go. Personally, I like to go down until my chest (not my face), hits the floor. That way, I know I&#8217;m going the same distance each and every time.</li>
<li><strong>Try not to let your elbows go flying way out with each repetition.</strong> Keep them relatively close to your body, and keep note of when they start to fly out when you get tired.</li>
<li><strong>Once your chest <b>(or nose/chin) </b>touches the floor (or your arms go down to a 90 degree angle)</strong>, pause slightly and then explode back up until you’re back in the same position.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do as many as you can until you start to feel your form slip (even slightly); you are done for that set.</p>
<p><b>Here’s why you should focus on form over quantity:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>10 good push-ups and 5 crappy ones are tough to quantify against eleven good push-ups.</li>
<li>If you can only do 10 of something, write down your results and aim for 11 next time.</li>
<li>Perfect form allows you to keep track of your improvements week over week.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Don’t worry if you can’t do a push-up yet. </b><b>We have a plan that will help you get there.</b></p>
<p>You need to start with an easier push movement, and work up to progressively more difficult types of moves that will eventually result in you doing true push-ups.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a similar type of progression we use when helping somebody in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1-on-1 Online Coaching Program</a> develop the proper strength to start doing proper push-ups.</span></p>
<p><b>We’ll progress from Level 1 Push-ups to Level 4 Push-ups:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Push-Ups: Level 1</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elevated Push-Ups: Level 2</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knee Push-ups: Level 3</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular Push-ups: Level 4</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LEVEL 1: HOW TO DO WALL PUSH-UPS</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Stand in front of a wall. Clench your butt, brace your abs, and set your hands on the wall at slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Walk backwards with your feet until your arms are fully extended and supporting your weight (generally one decent sized step back with both feet will suffice). Keeping the rest of your body in a straight line, steadily lower yourself towards the wall until your nose almost touches the wall, and then explode back up to the starting position.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a video of a wall push-up:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Wall Push Up - HASfit Push Up Exercise Demonstration - Beginner Push Ups - Easy Pushup" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpMTk21EmaM?start=20&#038;feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>HOW TO TRAIN WALL PUSH-UPS: </b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Do 4 sets of wall push-ups with a 2-minute rest between sets, every other day.</strong> Keep track of how many repetitions you can do WITH PROPER FORM for each set in a notebook for easy comparison to previous workouts. Once you can do 4 sets of 20 repetitions of wall push-ups, you can progress to knee push-ups.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><b>As we demonstrate in this video above from the <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nerd Fitness Academy</a>, e</b>levated push-ups are just what they sound like</strong> – your hands are on an elevated surface, whether it’s something as tall as a kitchen table or as low as a few blocks that are inches off the ground. This will depend on your level of strength and experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>If you’ve just progressed from wall push-ups, pick something that is at a level that’s right for you </strong>– I generally find the back of a park bench or the side of a picnic table to be a perfect height for doing incline push-ups. Like so:</p>
<p><iframe title="Incline Push Up" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4coDbSYnuh4?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>HOW TO TRAIN ELEVATED PUSH-UPS: </b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Do 4 sets of elevated push-ups with a 2-minute rest between sets, every other day.</strong> Again, keep track of all of your stats for how many proper form repetitions you can do in each set. Once you can do 4 sets of 20 repetitions, it’s time to either move to regular push-ups, knee push-ups, or a lower height for your hands to be supported.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you can do 4 sets of 20 repetitions, it’s time to either move to regular push-ups, knee push-ups, or a lower height for your hands to be supported.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>To work on progression, try to doing your elevated push-ups on the stairs in your house. </strong>As you get stronger, you can move your hands to lower and lower steps until your hands are on the ground.</p>
<p><b>LEVEL THREE: HOW TO DO KNEE PUSH-UPS </b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3583789" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/knee-push-up.gif" alt="Knee push-ups like this are a great way to progress to a regular push-up!" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Once </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>you’re comfortable doing wall or elevated push-ups, proceed to knee push-ups.</strong> Your shoulder and hand placement will look just like a regular push-up (an “arrow”, not a “T”), but you’ll stabilize yourself on your knees instead of your feet. As demonstrated here:</span></p>
<p><strong><iframe class="wistia_embed" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/wo2mz94445" name="wistia_embed" width="601" height="338" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>HOW TO TRAIN KNEE PUSH-UPS</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you can do 4 sets of 20 repetitions on your knees, you can start thinking about doing regular push-ups.</span></p>
<p><b>To recap, if you can’t do a regular push-up, move from:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Push-Ups: Level 1</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elevated Push-Ups: Level 2</span></li>

<p><b>#2) Side-to-Side Push-Ups </b><b>&#8211;</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Get into the classic push-up position and move your hands farther apart. Now, lower yourself down towards one arm only – you should feel like you’re supporting a lot of your weight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To complete the rep, slide horizontally over to the other arm, and push-up. The farther apart your hands, the higher percentage of your bodyweight will be supported by that side of your chest/shoulder and arm (thus getting harder)!</span></p>

<p><strong>So you&#8217;ve learned how to do a push-up, you can do a few of them, but you want to get better! </strong></p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you along the way:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get healthy!</strong> As you lose weight (<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/">which is 80% nutrition</a>!), you will have to move less weight around than before, which will make your push-ups easier to manage. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you had trouble losing weight in the past? Check out our article “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Can’t I Lose Weight?</a>” to find out why. </span></li>
<li><strong>Don’t cheat on the last few push-ups </strong>– when you’re tired, it’s easy to skip out on good form for your last few reps. As soon as you do one bad form push-up, you’re done. Finish up your four sets, write down your numbers, and try to beat those numbers next time.</li>
<li><strong>When starting out don’t do push-ups two days in a row.</strong> You need to give your muscles time to rebuild and recover – take off at least 48 hours in between your push-up adventure. However, when push-ups became a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warm-up exercise</a> for you &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">you can do them every day if you want. If you’re advanced, you can consider</span><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/that-time-i-did-2440-pull-ups-the-60-day-plp-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a PLP program</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get enough protein into your system after finishing up your workout</strong> &#8211; protein helps rebuild the muscles you just broke down doing push-ups, and it helps them rebuild those same muscles stronger than before. <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our ultimate guide on protein and protein shakes</a> for some tips on how to up your protein intake. </span></li>
<li><strong>If you can do 4 sets of 20-25 perfect form push-ups no sweat, then it’s time to start looking into push-up variations to keep things interesting.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Build up your core with planks &#8211; </strong>this will help keep your core strong so that it&#8217;s not the weakest link in your proper form push-ups.</li>
</ol>
<p><iframe title="Plank" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wy7QOQEZ8Rg?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These 6 tips will be a great addition to your strength training plan. Keep at it and before you know it you’ll be doing one arm push-ups like Batman.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3581189" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/batman-push-up.gif" alt="One arm push-ups are hardcore, which is why Batman does them." width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s that? You don’t have a strength building plan!!! Well then&#8230;</span></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Your Strength Building Plan?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3583884 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-explode.png" alt="Once you get comfortable with regular push-ups, you can try plyometric push ups like this." width="700" height="339" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-explode.png 700w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-explode-300x145.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-push-up-explode-600x291.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><strong>It makes me sad when we get emails from people who struggle and try and work hard to get healthier, and to be better at push-ups, and just can&#8217;t seem to make any progress.</strong></p>
<p>If that&#8217;s you, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you&#8217;re not alone</span>!</p>
<p><b>#1) Consider working with an online coach (or in-person trainer). </b></p>

<p>Go do some push-ups, and work on getting better with them every day.</p>

<strong>Regardless of your physique, if you are 400 pounds or 100 pounds, going to a regular commercial gym for the first time can be intimidating as hell.</strong></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s only if you can get yourself to use <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-20-second-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Seconds of Courage</a> (A Nerd Fitness rallying cry) to walk in the door!</p>
<p>I know many people who say “gyms are not not for me,” or “gyms are dumb” and never even go into one, simply because gyms can be scary/not welcoming/not cool.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, if you don’t have a gym membership, here’s <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-finding-the-right-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to find the right gym</a>, and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/6-things-you-should-do-before-buying-a-gym-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 things to know before joining a gym</a>. </span></i></p>

<ul>
<li>People <span style="font-weight: 400;">with pained looks on their faces </span>dutifully using machines that somewhat resemble medieval torture devices.</li>
<li>Others on cardio machines, treadmills, and ellipticals, and you can already picture yourself wiping out and ending up in a YouTube fail montage.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584033" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Treadmill.gif" alt="Make sure you know what you're doing at the gym so you don't accidentally go viral like this poor guy." width="335" height="230" /></li>
<li>Really strong jacked people picking up heavy free weights so effortlessly that <span style="font-weight: 400;">you can’t help but </span>instantly compare yourself <span style="font-weight: 400;">to them&#8230;and get intimidated</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you struggle with self-confidence, or you don’t love how you look, you might assume that everybody around you will be judging you the whole time and don’t want to subject yourself to this torture.</p>
<p>In fact, you might think that somehow you need to get in shape FIRST, and THEN you can go to the gym&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Wrong!</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You go to the gym TO get in shape. And I will get you there.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you are going to start using a gym, here are some truths you need to know:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Everybody around you is just as self-conscious as you are.</strong> Yes, that super jacked dude. Or that thin (or jacked) fit woman on the elliptical. They aren’t focused on you, because they’re too busy living inside their own head wondering if everybody is thinking about them.</li>
<li><strong>Everybody starts somewhere.</strong> You don’t look good so that you can then go to the gym. You go to the gym <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to get stronger</a>, more confident, and <em>then</em> look good.</li>
<li><strong>MOST will applaud you for trying.</strong> When I see somebody who is severely overweight at the gym, it makes me <em>happy</em> &#8211; they’re trying to better themselves<span style="font-weight: 400;">! That’s freaking AWESOME. </span>This is the mentality 90%+ of the people will have.</li>
<li><strong>MANY will be too self-focused to even notice you.</strong> These are the dudes lifting up their shirt in the mirror to check their abs, doing bicep curls in the squat rack, and/or making sure they take photos to post on Facebook to prove they did in fact go to the gym. #Fitspo #Instagram #OtherNonsensicalHashtags</li>
<li><strong>A RARE few will judge.</strong> Though, they’re not just judging you, I promise. They’re judging EVERYBODY around you, because they can’t help but compare themselves to others <span style="font-weight: 400;">and they’re terrible people</span>. This is no different than in real life. Screw these people, haters gonna hate, slaters gonna slate.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584044" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ac-slater.gif" alt="Be like Slater and do your own thing at the gym. Bring your weird glasses, who cares?" width="376" height="282" /></p>
<p>Sure, you can say “people are mean, the gym is scary, I just won’t show up.” But then, the terrorists win. And so do those people. So f*** that!.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, <b>this is going to be your gym mentality:</b></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accept that some people suck (like anywhere in life), and most people are indifferent or focused on being self-conscious themselves. Everybody else will applaud you for trying and being there.</li>
<li>Make an epic <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify </span>playlist that makes you feel heroic.</li>
<li>Wear clothes that you feel comfortable in.</li>
<li>Keep your headphones on, zone out everybody, and go about your business. Imagine you’re the only one there.</li>

<p><b>Many people think they need to hit the gym 6 days per week, dutifully alternating weight training with cardio and bootcamps to get that jacked/toned body they’re after. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exhausting and miserable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to me, and I LOVE the gym!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584371" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tired-at-gym.gif" alt="Make sure you add in rest days for your gym schedule or you'll end up like this dude. " width="434" height="244" /></p>
<p><b>So here’s what you need to know about gym frequency:</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go as much as you can, or as little as you want. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the workouts in this guide are “full-body workouts” which means they work out all of the muscles in your body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as we lay out in our “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-where-do-i-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strength 101: Beginner Strength Workouts</a>” article, your muscles get broken down in the gym and then they rebuild themselves stronger over the next 48 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that reason, we recommend you hit the gym 2-3 times per week, with a day off or more in between each session. </span></p>
<p><b>This advice comes with a few caveats: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a single mom or working two jobs or just busy living your life and you can only go to the gym once, great! Once a week is better than zero times a week!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have specific athletic or cardiovascular goals you’re training for, then hitting the gym more frequently might get you faster results.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trying to lose weight</a>, going to the gym more frequently probably WON’T get you faster results. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s all diet</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>“Steve, just tell me how often I should go to the gym!”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine! Try to work up to going to the gym 3 times per week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like Monday-Wednesday-Friday workout plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start and end the week with good wins! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, what’s that? You want to exercise on your off days too? Cool. Here’s how <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/what-should-i-do-on-my-off-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you should be doing on your non-training days</a>.</span></p>
<p>We craft our workout routines for <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our coaching clients</a> around their schedules &#8211; some people hit the gym 5 days per week, while others only go once a week. We&#8217;re all unique snowflakes!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay! Now that we got THAT out of the way, are we ready!? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great! Let&#8217;s level up in the gym!</span></p>
<h2><b><a name="first_day_of_gym"></a>Level One Gym Workout: First Day At the Gym</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3584354" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vader-hitting-it-at-gym-713x476.jpg" alt="Vader remembers his first day at the gym...he choked out his personal trainer with the force." width="713" height="476" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vader-hitting-it-at-gym.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vader-hitting-it-at-gym-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vader-hitting-it-at-gym-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>The toughest part about going to a gym for the first time is just walking through the door.</strong></p>
<p>If you do that, you’ve already gone farther than 74% of the population (a totally made up statistic that I&#8217;m using to prove my point), so give yourself a pat on the back.<span style="font-weight: 400;">*</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Don’t have enough mobility to pat yourself on the back? <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-nerds-guide-to-yoga-4-movements-to-try-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We’ll help you with that too</a>. </span></i></p>
<p>So on your first day in the gym, just GOING to the gym is a big step in the right direction. <span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’m proud of you.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584057" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Proud-Man.gif" alt="Both of us are super proud that you're going to the gym. It's a big first step!" width="266" height="278" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You might need to also change into gym clothes if you’re coming from work. I know walking out onto the floor in gym clothes might be intimidating too (another chance to use <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-20-second-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Seconds of Courage</a>).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now you’re wondering, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steve you half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder, what do I DO on my first day at the gym?”</span></i></p>
<p><strong>If you haven’t already done so, ask somebody at the front desk the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Hey I’m new here, could I get a tour of the gym?”</li>
<li>“Excuse me, today’s my first day, can you point me in the direction of a place I can stretch?”</li>
<li>“Can you help me work the treadmill?”</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go full YOLO and try to figure these things out on your own.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you’re able to get a personal tour, great!</strong> Ask the treadmill question when you get to them. If they can’t walk you through, just do a lap yourself and see where things are and who is doing what.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip (also works outside of the gym): <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/5-ways-to-immediately-appear-more-confident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretend like you’re confident</a> &#8211; even if you’re dying inside &#8211; walk with purpose, and nobody will question why you&#8217;re doing what you’re doing.</span></i></p>
<p>So, when you’re ready, walk over towards the stretching area, and do a few basic<span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobility/warm-up stretches </span>while continuing to get the lay of the land and see what people are doing (don’t stare excessively, cool? cool).</p>
<p><strong>Not sure what to do for <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warm-up movements</a>? That’s okay!</strong></p>
<p><b>Day 1 Beginner Warm-up Routine:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roll your head in half circles slowly, </strong>from shoulder to shoulder. <span style="font-weight: 400;">5 circles in each direction</span></li>
<li><strong>Slowly roll your shoulders</strong> forwards and backwards. <span style="font-weight: 400;">10 each way.</span></li>
<li><strong>Keep your legs stationary, and twist your torso,</strong> left and right. <span style="font-weight: 400;">10 twists each side.</span></li>
<li><strong>Quad stretch: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold each stretch for 5 seconds. Do 3 on each side</span><b>:</b></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1790288 " src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/quad-stretch.jpg" alt="Focus on stretching like above your first day at the gym." width="294" height="297" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross one arm in front your chest, then the other, as demonstrated here by <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead coach</a> Jim: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold each stretch for 5 seconds. Do 3 on each side</span><b>:</b></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1790284 " src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cross-arm-stretch.jpg" alt="Coach Jim showing you a great stretch for your first day at the gym." width="435" height="244" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cross-arm-stretch.jpg 685w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cross-arm-stretch-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cross-arm-stretch-160x90.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p>These movements have the awesome side-effect of you being able to look around the gym and get the “flow” of things, while still looking busy. Jim STILL uses this “trick” when checking out new gyms.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynamic warm-up</a> is the appetizer to ANY main course of <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training</a>. </span></p>
<p>Really just get your body moving. We don&#8217;t have to make you a gym warrior on Day 1. Some stretches and sightseeing will be good enough.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LEVEL 1 MISSION</span>: Take a lap around the gym and do your stretches.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you walked out right now after doing these things, it’s still a win for Day 1 in a gym. Seriously &#8211; I don’t care what you do on Day 1 &#8211; as long as it leaves you feeling good enough to come back for a Day 2!</span></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LEVEL 1 RECAP</span>:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking through the door makes you a winner.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask for a tour if you need to know where things are!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change into workout clothes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand in one spot, do a few stretches, get the lay of the land.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Get on the treadmill and start it up, based on the staff’s instructions.</strong></p>
<p>If you weren’t able to get instructions, many treadmills have a “quick start” button that will start things up.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why start with just walking</span>?</p>
<p>It gets you moving and out of your head! I know you’re smart &#8211; you’re reading NERD Fitness. But you also probably deal with paralysis by analysis a lot by overanalyzing everything, <span style="font-weight: 400;">so we need to get OUT of our heads and get moving!</span>!</p>
<p><b>Not only that, but <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walking is an AMAZING form of exercise</a>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking is how Tim the <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NF Academy</a> member <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-tim-walked-his-way-to-a-50-pound-weight-loss-wait-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost 50 lbs through walking and nutritional changes</a>.

<p><strong>So, for your first 10-15 minutes, just walk.</strong> Set the treadmill at 3mph or 3.5 or whatever speed is comfortable but not too strenuous.</p>
<p>A speed that gets you moving and gives you a chance to decide what you&#8217;ll do next while you look around the gym. (Aka, it gives you a chance to get out of your head and stop thinking everyone is looking at you. <span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not</span>)</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LEVEL 2 MISSION</span>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your <a href="##first_day_of_gym">Level 1 stretches</a>, then spend 15 minutes walking, and then you are free to go home.</span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat this as many days in a row that you need to until this starts to feel comfortable and you stop feeling self-conscious.</span></p>
<p>Scientists, Benedictine monks, and German scholars refer to such a thing as a “routine.”</p>
<p>As you get more comfortable, you can increase your walking speed or length of walking (20 minutes, 60 minutes, whatever)</p>
<p>If I’m gonna walk, I like to crush podcasts while doing so (My favorites: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch out for Fireballs</span>, Pardon My Take, and Bill Burr). Maybe you listen<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Audible.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you do in the gym doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; build the habit of going regularly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop confidence at the treadmill with just walking.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start to realize you have just as much of a right to be there as anybody else.</span></li>

<p>This routine of walking and stretching might only be one day in the gym for you, or it might be two months of this before you finally feel like you don’t want to jump out of your own skin while in the gym.</p>
<p>Going to the gym is the habit I want you to build, so this is a great start. Remember, you should be thinking in terms of &#8220;days and years,&#8221; not &#8220;weeks and months&#8221;:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/">many coaching clients</a> who spend MONTHS just walking and working up the courage to move beyond the treadmill.

<p><strong>After getting comfortable with the stretching/treadmill routine, you may want to hop on a weight lifting machine at this point like the leg press or chest press machine.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Is this progress? <em>Sure!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Can you do this? <em>Absolutely!</em></p>
<p>But, but, but&#8230; we are going to recommend you try some bodyweight exercises instead as your next step.</p>
<p>Controlling your body through space<span style="font-weight: 400;"> (not outer space)</span> is going to be more beneficial in the long run than strapping into a machine and moving through a set path.</p>
<p><strong>If you can do bodyweight exercises proficiently, then stepping into a machine is “easy.” </strong></p>
<p>The reverse is not always the case.</p>
<p>So, if we’ve convinced you to try some bodyweight exercises, then next thing is to identify a place in the gym you can do bodyweight exercises where you’re not in the way. This oftentimes might double as the place that some people are doing stretches, <span style="font-weight: 400;">where you’ve already been before!</span></p>
<p>If you don’t know, ask the front desk or <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-personal-trainer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a trainer</a>! That’s what they’re there for!</p>
<p><strong><b>LEVEL 3 MISSION: </b></strong></p>
<p>After your 5 minutes of warm-up (Level 1) and 10 minutes on the treadmill (Level 2), your next step is to go to a place you can do the Level 3 Gym Workout:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 bodyweight squats</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 bodyweight squats</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 bodyweight squats</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can’t get through it all?</strong> No worries, do what you can.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This style of alternating one exercise with another is called a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/circuit-training-build-some-muscles-burn-some-fat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuit workout</a>, by the way!</span></i></p>

<p><strong>These are two key movements in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginner Bodyweight Workout Routine</a>, and the foundation of any <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-where-do-i-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training routine</a>! </strong></p>
<p>If you just did the above <span style="font-weight: 400;">mini-workout</span> for a month, you’d be off to a great start! If you’re feeling frisky and starting to find some <span style="font-weight: 400;">confidence </span>in the gym, it’s time to branch out more!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>LEVEL 3 RECAP:</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Warm up on the treadmill with a 10 minute walk</li>
<li>Find a place where you can do bodyweight movements out of the way</li>
<li>Complete 3 circuits of 10 push-ups and 10 bodyweight squats each at a pace that works for you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stay at this stage as long as you need, until you can move on!</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note: </span></strong><b>If you enjoy the bodyweight brigade, or you’re not quite ready to start doing weight training yet, that’s cool too.</b></p>

<p><strong>It’s time to wander into the place that strikes fear in the heart of most gym goers: </strong></p>
<p>The free weight section.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DO NOT FORGET THIS:</span> </strong>If you are a 400 pound woman, or 85 years-old, or a 100-pound man, you have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just as much of a right</span> to be in the free weight section as anybody else.</em></p>
<p>It might take yet another <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-20-second-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Seconds of Courage</a> to wander in there, so I’m challenging you to try it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LEVEL 4 MISSION</span>: </strong></p>
<p>After you do 10 minutes of walking on the treadmill, go to the dumbbell section, grab a single 10 lb (4.5kg) dumbbell, and find a flat bench like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1790327 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/weight-bench.jpeg" alt="Most gyms will have plenty of benches like this for you to try out." width="245" height="245" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/weight-bench.jpeg 245w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/weight-bench-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/weight-bench-160x160.jpeg 160w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/weight-bench-180x180.jpeg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /></p>
<p><strong>Stand next to that bench, and make sure nobody is using it.</strong> If somebody is at a bench nearby, ask them “is anybody using this bench?” If they say no, put your towel on the bench, your 10 lb dumbbell on it, and stand next to it.</p>
<p><strong>We’re going to add a 1-arm dumbbell row to our circuit above:</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="One Arm Dumbbell Row | Nerd Fitness" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ej9XLPN3mPo?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>That’s it! Just one dumbbell exercise! </strong>Boom! You are now <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-where-do-i-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weight training like a boss</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s your new<b> Level 4 Gym Workout C</b>ircuit: <b>Dumbbell Division A</b></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 bodyweight squats</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 one arm dumbbell rows (10 per arm)</li>
</ul>
<p>Do this circuit once, and then repeat two more times if you’re feeling good.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To recap, or if you skipped Steps 1-3 (I’m only slightly offended), here’s how to properly do:</span></p>

<p><strong>Congrats! You’ve used dumbbells!</strong></p>
<p>Remember, everybody started somewhere, and we’re just working on getting you comfortable being in the free weight section.</p>
<p><strong>Want to continue adding dumbbells movements into your workout?</strong> Let’s add them to the squats.</p>
<p>Use the same dumbbell to do &#8220;goblet squats.&#8221;</p>
<p>They’re named as such because it looks like you’re holding a goblet that you don’t want to spill.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s a video of Staci and Jim demonstrating the Goblet Squat pulled from our self-paced course, <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nerd Fitness Academy</a>:</strong></p>
<p><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script></p>
<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_dr4dyi2cum dnt=1 videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">
<div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/dr4dyi2cum/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" /></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So your <b>Level 4 Gym Workout: Dumbbell Division B is 3 circuits of the following: </b></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 goblet squats</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 dumbbell rows/side</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you go to the gym 3x a week, work your way up to the following routine:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Light stretching and walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes</li>
<li>3 complete circuits of this beginner circuit</li>
<li>Go home and eat good food and play video games</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This will put you ahead of 95% gym going population.</strong> This puts you on a great path to building a healthy, antifragile, resilient body.</p>
<p>Add a little more weight here and there- making the minimal possible jumps each time <span style="font-weight: 400;">(going from 10 lb to 12.5 lb dumbbells, for example)</span>.</p>
<p>Make your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/my-7-favorite-push-up-variations-and-the-nf-push-up-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">push-up variation</a> a little harder over time.</p>
<p><em>You can stick with the above for MONTHS.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ready for another upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>The last dumbbell exercise to learn is the dumbbell Romanian deadlift (RDL). This is like a cousin of the bodyweight squat where we move through the hips more than the knees.</p>
<p>Grab a pair of dumbbells now, push your hips back and bow forward like you’re being polite.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Or, you’re like one of those novelty “drinking birds.”</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584380" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/drinking-bird.gif" alt="When at the gym doing a Romanian deadlift, move like this drinking bird. " width="340" height="247" /></p>
<p>Bring the dumbbells down to about your knees, not to the ground, then stand back up.</p>
<p><strong>You can see the exercise right here:</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="Dumbbell Romanian deadlift" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BxkV9h3h2k?start=15&#038;feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Every other workout, swap out the goblet squat for the dumbbell Romanian deadlift.</p>
<p><strong>So our circuit is now alternating with each gym workout.</strong></p>
<p>Do 3 circuits of each if you can! If the weight is too light, use heavier dumbbells the next time you train.</p>
<p><b>Level 4 Gym Workout: Dumbbell Division C:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>10 goblet squats OR 10 dumbbell Romanian deadlifts</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 dumbbell rows per arm.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">LEVEL 4 RECAP</span>:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember you have just as much a right as everybody else to use the free weights.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a deep breath, go into free weights section, and get a 10 lb. dumbbell.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn to do a bent over row and goblet squats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn to do dumbbell Romanian deadlifts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High five yourself for weight training.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Training with dumbbells opens up infinite possibilities.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, probably not INFINITE possibilities, but close enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are somebody that wants to learn how to train with dumbbells even more seriously, or you’re looking for ways to put that dumbbell set you have in your garage to proper use, let us help!</span></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584078" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squat-rack-713x535.jpg" alt="Use a squat rack like this." width="518" height="389" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squat-rack-713x535.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squat-rack-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squat-rack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/squat-rack-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">THIS IS A SMITH MACHINE (bar is attached to apparatus). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AVOID THESE</span>:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3584079" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/smith-machine.jpg" alt="Don't use the Smith Machine, unless it's for inverted rows at the gym." width="375" height="500" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/smith-machine.jpg 375w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/smith-machine-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: if you are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-stay-in-shape-while-traveling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">training in a hotel gym</a>, an apartment gym, or at some locations like Planet Fitness, they might NOT have a squat rack! </span></i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is due to them not wanting to be liable for somebody using a barbell incorrectly, so it’s easier for them to just tell you “A Smith Machine is the same thing.” It is not, in fact, the same thing. You need a gym that has an ACTUAL squat rack with a free barbell.</span></i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your gym doesn’t have a squat rack, and you want to start barbell training, I would strongly consider <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-finding-the-right-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finding a new gym</a> or just hanging out in the Level 4: Dumbbell Division!</span></i></p>
<p><b>If using a squat rack scares the crap out of you:</b> wait to attempt your FIRST trip to the squat rack when the gym is nearly empty, or recruit a buddy who knows what they&#8217;re doing. If there’s a special day you can go VERY early to the gym, or VERY late, or during the workday, do it then.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">YOUR NEXT LEVEL 5 MISSION</span>: </b></p>
<p><strong>Attempt 1 set of a 5 barbell squats with JUST the bar</strong> (first ask the staff or a trainer how much the bar weighs: most standard barbells weigh 45 lbs (20Kg) but your gym might not have standard barbells).</p>
<p><em>You can then complete our tried and true circuit &#8211; replacing goblet squats with barbell squats.</em></p>
<p><strong>So our circuit is now <b>3 circuits.</b></strong></p>
<p><b>Level 5 Gym Workout: Barbell Battalion A:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>10 barbell squats or 10 dumbbell Romanian deadlifts</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 dumbbell rows/side</li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(See <a href="#level_4_gym_workout">Level 4</a> for explanations on the Dumbbell deadlifts and rows)</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Staci, let’s move on to her favorite exercise (and mine!)&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And watch the video demonstration here:</span></p>
<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe title="16 - Barbell Deadlift Video" src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/owt4doefbm?dnt=1&#038;videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div>

<p><script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script></p>
<p>The deadlift movements starts with the weight on the ground, and ends with it back on the ground.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3580373" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-deadlift.gif" alt="Rebel Leader Steve showing how to do a 420 lb deadlift at the gym." width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>If you’ve got regular, large weights (usually 45 lbs/20 kgs) on each side then the bar sits the proper height off the ground.</p>
<p>Some facilities have lighter plates at that same large diameter. Use them.</p>
<p>If you are lifting less weight (or just using the bar to start off) then DON’T do the deadlift from the ground. The bar will be too low to the ground and mess up proper technique.</p>
<p><strong>Instead, do the following to start your deadlifts at proper height:</strong></p>
<p><b>1) Use blocks to adjust the barbell starting height:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3580550" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/deadlift_boxes-713x535.jpg" alt="You can use all sorts of things to raise a deadlift bar up, like these boxes." width="471" height="354" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/deadlift_boxes-713x535.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/deadlift_boxes-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/deadlift_boxes-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/deadlift_boxes-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/deadlift_boxes.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<p><b>2) Use the safety bars in a squat rack</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to set the height of the bar correctly!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3580374" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/deadlift-rack-713x535.jpg" alt="This picture shows a deadlift rack, great for...deadlifting!" width="485" height="364" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/deadlift-rack-713x535.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/deadlift-rack-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/deadlift-rack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/deadlift-rack-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/deadlift-rack.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></p>
<p><b>3) Do the Romanian deadlift instead! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Whew, glad we learned that!). It’s the exact same movement as the dumbbell Romanian deadlifts, you’re just using a barbell instead.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584384" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/romanian-deadlift.gif" alt="A Romanian Deadlift is a great exercise once you progress to barbells at the gym." width="414" height="275" /></p>
<p><strong>START WITH LIGHT WEIGHT &#8211; JUST the bar. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As we cover in our “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-much-weight-should-i-be-lifting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How much weight should I lift?</a>”, you should ALWAYS start with just the bar. </span></strong></p>
<p>And work on technique.</p>
<p>Only then should you start adding more weight, and add it slowly &#8211; you’ll be picking up heavy weight in no time, so don’t rush it.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s Staci demonstrating a proper barbell Romanian deadlift from our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/academy-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nerd Fitness Academy</a> course:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you’ve started doing these two movements in your routine, your two alternating gym days will look like this. Simply alternate every time you go to the gym (with a day off in between sessions).</p>
<p><b>Level 5 Gym Workout: Barbell Battalion:</b></p>
<p><strong><b>Day A Circuit</b> &#8211; 3 rounds of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 barbell squats</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/inverted-row-are-you-missing-out-on-this-great-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inverted bodyweight rows</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><b>Day B Circuit</b> &#8211; 3 rounds of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5 barbell romanian deadlifts</li>
<li>10 push-ups</li>
<li>10 dumbbell rows per arm</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure what a bodyweight row is? It’s an AMAZING exercise that you’ll need to master if you’re going to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/do-a-pull-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get your first pull-up or chin-up</a> one day! </span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>LEVEL 5 RECAP:</b></span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbell training will change your life like it has changed mine.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on proper form, and slowly start to add weight to the bar.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are now a gym “regular” and I salute you!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I know the barbell squat and barbell deadlift are two complex, potentially scary exercises. It’s important to get your form correctly now when you are just lifting the bar, so that you don’t hurt yourself once you start adding weight!</span></p>

<p><strong>Did I tell you that I’m proud of you yet?</strong> I really am, I promise. Your mom is proud too. So is your dad, but he just doesn’t know how to express it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So now you’re thinking: “Steve, I did a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-to-squat-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">barbell squat</a>.

<p><strong>The pull-up or chin-up!</strong></p>

<p><b>I asked the entire 15-person staff in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Coaching Program</a> &#8211; most of whom have trained clients in a gym for 5+ years &#8211; what information they would share with new gym goers:</b></p>
<p><strong>Take your time.</strong> The above 6 level workout plan might take you 12+ months to move through, and that’s okay! I would rather you slowly wade into the water instead of terrifying yourself with the thought of cannonballing into the deep end and never <span style="font-weight: 400;">even starting a gym routine</span>.</p>
<p>Stick with what you know, and then bit by bit, one movement at a time, branch out and try new things.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> &#8220;days and years,&#8221; not &#8220;weeks and months.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe title="Want to get in shape? Think in days and years, not weeks and months" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ieY_8ZL0v78?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Do what makes you happy.</strong> You might have noticed above I didn’t mention things like bicep curls, bench press, cardio classes, spin class, etc.</p>
<p>If those things make you happy, start adding them to the mix. However, if you are only doing those things because you think you are supposed to, don’t!</p>
<p>The above 6-Stage strategy combined with a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/">healthy nutritional strategy</a> will get you 95% of the way to where you want to go.</p>
<p>I promise. Nerd’s honor.</p>
<p><strong>Write down everything you’re doing <b>and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-track-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">track your progress</a></b>.</strong> Keep a simple note on your phone, write in a notebook, use Evernote, whatever. Write down what you do so that you know what to do next time.</p>
<p>When you get stronger and things feel too easy, you know to move up in weight slowly (and record that too!).</p>
<p>Keeping track of everything is one of the easiest and most important ways to make progress. Staci, Jim, and I ALL still record every workout and never stop trying to get a teeny, tiny bit stronger with each session.</p>
<p><strong>It’s better to lift a TOO LIGHT weight than try one that’s TOO HEAVY.</strong> You want to finish the workout saying “hey I could do more, this is encouraging” rather than “that was too much, I hurt myself/failed/and I’m demoralized.”</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t know, ask somebody who works there.</strong> If you’re worried that you’re using a machine incorrectly, and you’re sheepish and self-conscious about it, ask somebody who works in the gym.</p>
<p>Usually there will be trainers that work there walking around the floor &#8211; ask them! That’s what they’re there for.</p>
<p>They can help you set the safety bars and pins on the squat rack if you’re not sure how. They can tell you how to adjust the seat on a machine, or how the treadmill works. That is what they are there for!</p>
<p><strong>If you want to hire a trainer for a few sessions, it might be a great investment! </strong><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-personal-trainer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Good trainers are hard to come by</a>, but if you happen to like our style of doing things here at Nerd Fitness, we have our own <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/">1-on-1 Coaching Program</a> that will program your workouts and help you fix your diet:</p>

<p><strong>If you are a member at a Planet Fitness or similar gym:</strong> Your gym might not allow you to do barbell deadlifts, might not have a squat rack, or ONLY have a Smith Machine. If this is true of your gym, this is okay!</p>
<p>Do the best you can with what you have. Like MacGyver.</p>
<p>You can still get quite strong with the dumbbell workouts and bodyweight movements in Stage 4! And you’ll be that much more prepared when you do start working with barbells <span style="font-weight: 400;">if you eventually <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-finding-the-right-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join a different gym</a></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good.</strong> Just going to the gym takes courage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying a machine for the first time takes courage.</li>
<li>Picking up a dumbbell takes courage.</li>
<li>Using the squat rack takes a lot of courage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry about perfect, or having perfect form or the perfect routine after you finish this article, just START! It’s how we all learn: like scientists trying new experiments and subtly tweaking the variables.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3584389" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bill-nye.gif" alt="Act like a scientist until you get your workout routine at the gym just right. Experiment!" width="306" height="306" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are our favorite tips and tricks with regards to the gym. But I’d be remiss if I didn’t also mention something equally important:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gym </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">etiquette</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list includes some obvious things like wiping down the bench after you use it, or not monopolizing a squat rack, but then some other more subtle things that will keep you in everybody’s good graces!</span></p>

<p><b>If you read this far, 6000 words later, I have to imagine it means you’re really interested in getting started with strength training! </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first time going to a gym can be nerve-wracking and exciting, but it’s the 100th, 500th, 1000th trip to the gym where results get made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that means you need to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-build-healthy-habits-that-stick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BUILD the habit correctly</a> for going to the gym. </span></p>
<p><b>It comes down to a few key things:</b></p>
<p><b>1) Accountability! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to going to the gym, it’s really easy to fall off the wagon once life gets busy. For that reason, I encourage you to be accountable to somebody other than yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/motivation-youre-doing-it-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">motivation sucks, and will fail you</a> when you need it most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, instead of using motivation, instead cultivate discipline and accountability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it almost impossible for you to skip the gym:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruit a friend to join you at the gym! You don’t want to let them down, right?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepay for a bunch of sessions with a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-personal-trainer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good personal trainer</a>.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an online coach</a> who checks in on you regularly!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Focus on <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/dodge-this-how-the-matrix-can-help-you-take-control-of-your-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hacking into the Matrix</a> and setting up your system! </strong>Put your workout time and place into your Google Calendar so that you always know when your next workout is. Focus on creating an environment where you are more likely than not gonna DO THE THING you want to do (go to the gym). We call this &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-build-a-batcave-for-habit-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building your Batcave</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>3) Cultivate a love of constant improvement.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Imagine this: you’re no longer going to the gym </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lose weight or look good. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those things are a happy consequence of what you’re really there for:</span></p>
<p><em>Because you ACTUALLY like to work out! </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cannot tell you how many <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NF Coaching Clients</a> I’ve seen message me and say “Holy crap Steve, I don’t know how it happened, but I actually LIKE working out now!”</span></p>
<p><b>Every week, you’re excited to hit the gym because: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re adding more weight to your squats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are attempting a new personal best for the deadlift.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re trying to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/do-a-pull-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get your first pull-up</a>. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get to see your gym friend and hear how his day went.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You LOVE how you feel after the gym. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Getting there takes time and energy, but that’s really when life changes and sh** gets magical with regards to your health and fitness.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the tools we’ve created to help you turn the gym into something you look forward to:</span></p>

<h2><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611195 size-large" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/robin-batman-superman-713x400.jpg" alt="Robin understands the argument on losing fat and building muscle.

<p><b>Before we get too far ahead, let’s talk about why losing fat while gaining muscle can be problematic.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conflict comes about over the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To lose fat, your body </span><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">needs to be in a caloric deficit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This deficit forces your body to use pre-existing fat stores for fuel.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To gain muscle, your body needs to be in a caloric surplus. This surplus provides the energy your body requires to repair and build bigger muscles.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this, losing fat (caloric deficit) at the same time one is gaining muscle (caloric surplus) seems impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if we go a few steps deeper into the science, it IS possible!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3611089" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Inconceivable.gif" alt="A foe from the Prince Bride not believing you can lose fat while gaining muscle." width="480" height="235" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To appreciate the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuance here</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, let’s get into some specifics on losing fat and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gaining</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> muscle separately, and then we’ll combine them. </span></p>
<h2><a name="how_to_lose_fat"></a>HOW DO YOU LOSE FAT?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611196 size-large" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/comic-book-guy-713x475.jpg" alt="How can this beloved character lose fat?

<p><b>There is a simple answer and a slightly less simple answer when it comes to losing body fat. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple answer: “consume fewer calories than you expend or burn.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight words, and one or two of those could probably be thrown out. </span></p>
<p><b>When your body needs more calories than the amount you are eating, you are in a “caloric deficit.” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your body doesn’t have enough calories to go around, so it’ll start breaking down parts of itself for energy requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many calories do I need and burn every day? </span></p>
<p><em>(You can <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calculate your daily caloric needs here</a>).</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hope is that your body will mostly pull from fat stores, though depending on how you are training it will also break down muscle too.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><b>Said again: when you are eating a caloric deficit, your body will pull from both its fat stores AND existing muscle for energy.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3611092" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/surprised-monkey.gif" alt="Yes, if you're not careful you can lose fat AND muscle while losing weight." width="320" height="218" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a physique and health standpoint, obviously we’d prefer that your body doesn’t break down muscle when in a caloric deficit, and instead really focuses on using fat stores instead.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I make this point for a reason:</strong> your goal in fitness shouldn’t only be “weight loss,” despite the common vernacular used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who cares what the scale says, right? </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3611094" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/scale.gif" alt="A scale can be misleading when you're trying to lose fat and gain muscle." width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p><strong>The goal instead is to reduce body fat while also keeping the muscle you have (or even building more muscle). </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leads to a better physique and a healthier body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the reason why there is a large industry around “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/body-fat-percentage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tracking body fat percentage</a>.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By reducing your total fat on your body, OR increasing muscle mass, you’ll end up with a lower body fat percentage (it’s just a simple ratio of fat to everything else).</span></p>
<p><strong>And lower body fat percentages are where “toned arms” and “6-pack abs” hang out.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611099" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/arnold-cut-out.gif" alt="Arnold lost body fat and gained muscle to achieve his physique. And maybe some super glue." width="462" height="260" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll talk about tips to keep and grow muscle while in a caloric deficit further down. For now, remember you need fewer calories “in” compared to calories “out” for weight loss to occur, from either fat stores or muscle. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be asking, “Steve, what’s easier to do? Burn more calories or consume less?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good question.</span></p>
<p><b>Numbers will help tell the story:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> though this is a gross oversimplification &#8211; let&#8217;s use the &#8216;widely accepted&#8217; starting point of &#8220;3,500 calories equals roughly one pound of fat.&#8221;<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to lose one pound &#8211; or half a kilogram &#8211; of body fat in a week (<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/just-how-fast-can-i-get-the-body-i-want/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a worthy, sustainable goal for some</a>), you would need to create a caloric deficit of 500 calories per day: either through </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consuming 500 fewer calories</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burning 500 more calories</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A combination of the two</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which half is easier to affect?</span></p>
<p><strong>Here are both halves of that equation. 500 calories equals: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of calories found in a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimate of the calories required to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/running-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run five miles</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611107" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/batman-surprised.gif" alt="Yes, you will have to run for a long time to burn 500 calories. " width="364" height="215" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to maintaining a caloric deficit, it really comes down to diet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">significantly more effective and time-efficient to consume 500 fewer calories</span> than it is to burn 500 additional calories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Time magazine controversially pointed out &#8211; with tons of cited studies &#8211; “<a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1914974-1,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exercise alone won’t make you thin</a>,” It’s too easy to add more calories in, and requires too much work to effectively influence “calories out.”</span></p>
<p><b>Which brings us to our slightly less simple answer on how to lose body fat: </b></p>
<p><b>You need to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch what you eat</a>, and do so in a  sustainable way. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Nerd Fitness, we are firm believers that 80-90% of the fat loss equation comes down to diet (<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/about-2/rules-of-the-rebellion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out Rule # 4</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s another idea we focus on: EAT MOSTLY REAL FOOD.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3602602" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/real-food.gif" alt="These image shows some real food, critical if you're trying to lose body fat." width="412" height="309" /></p>
<p><strong>Meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, nuts are all great examples of REAL food. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These foods are very nutrient dense and often low in calories compared to their processed counterparts. Which means you get filled up without overeating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Win-win-win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever seen the difference between 200 calories of broccoli and 200 calories of a bagel? <a href="https://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-200-calories-look-like.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WiseGEEK</a> does a great job of displaying this, so we’ll borrow a couple of their photos.</span></p>
<p><b>200 calories of broccoli:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3574949 " src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli.jpg" alt="A pic of 200 calories of broccoli" width="605" height="403" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli.jpg 605w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p>
<p><b>200 calories of a bagel:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611209 " src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/200-calories-of-bagel-713x474.png" alt="This picture shows you 200 calories worth of a bagel, which is about 2/3 of one." width="605" height="402" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/200-calories-of-bagel-713x474.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/200-calories-of-bagel-300x200.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/200-calories-of-bagel-768x511.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/200-calories-of-bagel-600x399.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/200-calories-of-bagel.png 780w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p>
<p><strong>That’s why REAL food is the answer to creating a sustainable caloric deficit. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people can eat an entire bagel no problem. Plates of broccoli, with all of the fiber, are much tougher to overeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We lay it all out in our <a href="https://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-200-calories-look-like.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginner’s Guide to Healthy Eating</a>.</strong> It’ll provide tips on how to gradually create habits that get you to a “REAL food” way of eating, including proper portion sizes, tips on batch cooking, and a cameo from Winnie the Pooh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all of this, we advise you to take it slow, so new habits of healthy eating become permanent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something you can do for the rest of your life.</span></p>
<p><b>It’s a strategy we work closely with our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coaching clients</a> on:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nutritional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adjustments they feel comfortable making.

<p><strong>Let me explain again: what you eat will be 80%-90% of the equation to lose body fat. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other 10-20%? Exercise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course it’s exercise. </span></p>

<p><b>If you want to build muscle, you’re gonna have to lift heavy things and eat in a way that your body has enough calories and protein to build that muscle. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes logical sense.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-building-muscle-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginner’s Guide to Building Muscle and Strength</a>, I summarize it as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lift heavy things</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat a diet based on your goals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rest so your body can recover.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Let’s chat about each one quickly.</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>1) Lift heavy things.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I will always be on <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Strength Training</a>. If you’re looking to build muscle, you’re gonna need to lift heavy things.</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you lift an object (<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or your own bodyweight</a>) enough times, your muscles reach the point of failure. This causes your muscles to tear and breakdown. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your muscle rebuilds itself following the workout, it’ll be bigger and stronger than before. Then you do it again. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And again. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And again. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as you are eating enough to rebuild your muscle, you’ll get stronger!</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>2) <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eat a diet based on your goals</a>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because your muscle needs to be rebuilt after exercise, the calories are gonna need to come from somewhere. I’ll talk a lot about proper diet in the next section (with a Harry Potter analogy), so I won’t spend too much time on it here. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just know that eating the right quantity of foods will be a big part of gaining muscle.  </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>3) Rest. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your body rebuilds itself while you sleep, so make sure you get <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/are-you-making-these-mistakes-with-your-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of rest each night</a>. I’m talking 7-8+ hours. This will help ensure your body has the time it needs to grow stronger. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re strength training and only getting 6 hours of sleep a night or less, you’re really doing yourself a disservice. Go to bed!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611115" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/donald-sleeping.gif" alt="Donald knows he has to get plenty of rest to grow muscle. If only that sink would stop dripping." width="292" height="219" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the short gist of how to build strength: challenge your muscles, eat well, and get some rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s narrow in on our second point, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat a diet based on your goals</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” It’ll become very important when balancing both losing body fat and gaining muscle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do that properly, grab your owl, and let’s chat about Hogwarts. </span></p>
<h2><b><a name="how_to_lose_fat_gain_muscle"></a>How to Lose Fat WHILE Gaining Muscle (The Science)</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611211 size-large" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-harry-potter-713x401.jpg" alt="To talk about losing fat and gaining muscle, let's use an analogy from Hogwarts!" width="713" height="401" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-harry-potter-713x401.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-harry-potter-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-harry-potter-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-harry-potter-600x337.jpg 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lego-harry-potter.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><b>To answer the question of losing body fat and gaining muscle at the same time, I’d like to introduce an analogy from the world of Harry Potter.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall the “Sorting Hat:” The Sorting Hat’s job was to determine which of the four houses kids will call their home.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3495563 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/gryffindor.gif" alt="The sorting hat will help us tell the story on calories and losing fat." width="400" height="162" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s almost like a traffic director: “Harry, you will go to Gryffindor! Draco, you will go to Slytherin!”</span></p>
<p><b>Your body operates on a VERY similar operation: every day it receives new calories (when you eat), and it needs to decide what to do with them! </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You eat a chicken parm sub with fries and a 20 ounce soda. Your body then has to know where to route all those calories.</span></p>
<p><b>To keep things simple, it has three choices. It’ll sort those calories into one of three houses: </b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Burn for Fuel.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Rebuild Muscle.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. Store as Fat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, when you eat food, your body sorts most of those calories into “Burn for Fuel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There’s a number of calories your body needs each day just existing:</strong> to keep your liver functioning, your heart pumping, your brain operating, to regulate your body temperature, and so on &#8211; it burns a good chunk of calories just keeping the lights on.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3595570" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-pumping.gif" alt="A beating heart requires calories, which factors into your calorie needs." width="471" height="308" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is your “total daily energy expenditure” which you can calculate for yourself in with our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TDEE calculator</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also “B. Rebuild as Muscle” and “C. Store as Fat,” which I devoted entire sections to above. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>This is where the problems arise:</b> When you overeat calories and your body doesn’t need anymore to fuel itself, it takes those extra calories and stores them as fat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, our goal is the OPPOSITE of this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to keep the muscle we have (or grow it) while getting rid of the fat! </span></p>
<p><b>So let’s imagine a scenario where we pull all this together by strength training heavy AND reducing our caloric intake: </b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You strength train regularly, and your muscles break down and need to be rebuilt.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t consume enough calories to both rebuild muscle and fuel itself. There&#8217;s not enough to go into the “Burn for Fuel” and “Rebuild Muscle” houses. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your body just shut down?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOPE!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611117" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dog-surprised.gif" alt="Yep, if you have fat on you your body will pull from it to take care of its needs." width="272" height="290" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your body has been preparing for this, by storing any excess calories over the years in the “Store as Fat” house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means your body can pull from “Store as Fat” to make sure all the work still gets done, including your daily functions as a human and rebuilding the muscle you tore apart.</span></p>
<p><b>Said another way: if you have fat stores (and we all do), you do not need to be in a “caloric surplus” to rebuild muscle.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The calories stored in your fat cells act as this required energy. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is also evidence that muscle can even be <i>grown </i>while in a caloric deficit. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meaning bigger muscles with a lower belt size.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you want to skip all the experimentation and trial and error, you can have a Nerd Fitness Coach do all the heavy lifting for you (not really, you’ll still need to work out).</span></p>

<p><b>Let’s bring this all together and create some actionable steps to losing body fat and building muscle at the same time.</b></p>
<p><b>1) Sustain a caloric deficit while eating enough protein. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need your body to burn more calories than you consume, and also provide your body with <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enough protein</a> to rebuild its muscle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way to shed body fat is during a caloric deficit.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611184" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/downward-arrow.gif" alt="You need to reduce your calories and be in a deficit if your goal is to lose fat." width="460" height="232" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the Sorting Hat analogy: If you’re eating too much, your excess calories are being sent to the “Store as Fat” house. We want to pull from this house instead. So eat less than you burn consistently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have 3 resources for you: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beginner’s Guide to Healthy Eating</a></strong>. If you want tips and tricks to create habits based on REAL food, that guide will help get you there.</span></li>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to follow some predetermined blueprint like “low-carb.” You can create your own diet (which is what I do). Learn all about it <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right here</a>. </span></p>
<p><b>2) Strength train. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you could sell a pill that could be prescribed to every single person on Earth to make them healthier, it would look something like <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a strength training routine</a> in a bottle. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3581189" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/batman-push-up.gif" alt="A one arm push-up can help you lose fat and build muscle, but maybe start with regular push-ups first." width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the best things you can do for your body.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>   </span></p>
<p><strong>And really, if you’re <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-building-muscle-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after building muscle</a>, you’re gonna need to lift something! Either weights or your own bodyweight.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to challenge your muscles in order for them to get stronger. Now, as we discuss in our article on the <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-correct-number-of-reps-per-set-in-the-gym/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">correct number of reps and sets</a>, there are multiple ways to do so. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can lift lighter weights for lots of reps. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or lift really heavy with fewer reps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The important thing:</strong> pick a strategy and get started.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611182" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/my-girl-lets-go.gif" alt="Vada is ready to strength train! And torment her Dad's GF." width="383" height="289" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 3 paths forward: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a beginner bodyweight workout</a>. </span></li>

</ol>
<p><strong>To recap:</strong> if you train heavy and eat a caloric deficit, your body will pull from its fat stores to both fuel itself and potentially also build muscle. This is a double whammy of AWESOME.</p>
<p><b>3) Prioritize protein. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of being in a caloric deficit and lifting weights (or yourself), <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eating enough protein</a> is one of the key components of both losing body fat and building muscle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Protein is the number one nutrient for creating new tissue.</strong><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-6" id="refmark-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3568727" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sponge-bob-ripped.gif" alt="Sponge Bob knows how to build muscle and strength." width="379" height="253" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when you cut out calories to create a caloric deficit, don’t cut them from protein sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that participants can gain muscle, even while in a caloric deficit, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as long as they eat enough protein</span>.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-7" id="refmark-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It’s important enough that I’ll say it again:</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t want your body cannibalizing its muscles while you are in a caloric deficit, you need to eat plenty of protein.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-8" id="refmark-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How much protein?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we point out in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide to Protein</a>, roughly 1 gram for every pound of your weight, with an upper limit of 250 grams.<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-9" id="refmark-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Or two grams for every kilogram if you are on the metric system. This means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you weigh 300 pounds (136 kg), eat 250g of protein.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you weigh 250 pounds (113 kg), eat 250g of protein.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you weigh 200 pounds (91 kg), eat 200g of protein.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you weigh 180 pounds (82 kg), eat 180g of protein.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gist: don’t skip out on protein. It should be on your plate for every meal (we’ll show you exactly how much in the next section).</span></p>
<p><b>If these generalized recommendations stress you out, and you want to know exactly what to do, we can help! </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be thinking, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s all well and good Steve, but what’s that actually look like?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like this!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3606758" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-713x561.png" alt="If your meal plate looks like this, you're doing great!" width="713" height="561" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-713x561.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-300x236.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate-600x473.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healthy-eating-plate.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken from our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide to Start Eating Healthy</a>, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which I really want you to read.</span></i></p>
<p><b>The plate is composed of the following: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-2 servings of protein (¼ of plate)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 servings of vegetables (½ of plate)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 serving potatoes, rice, or pasta. (1/4th of plate)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 serving of fat (size of your thumb)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 zero calorie or low calorie beverage (water, diet soda, tea)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By sticking to our Healthy Plate strategy above, you’ll focus on “REAL food,” which will help you maintain a caloric deficit over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s hone in on protein for a moment, because it’s the critical piece for “building muscle.”</span></p>
<p><b>Protein can come from any number of sources, including:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meat (steak, bison, pork).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fowl (chicken, turkey, duck).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eggs!<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-10" id="refmark-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fish and shellfish (salmon, tuna, shrimp).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legumes (black beans, chickpeas).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not a meat-eater? Read our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-eat-a-plant-based-diet-a-scientific-look-at-going-vegan-safely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive plant-based guide</a>!</span></i></p>
<p><b>A serving of protein is about the size and thickness of your palm.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3610479 size-large" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/protein-serving-size-713x475.png" alt="A serving of protein should be about the size of your palm, like so." width="713" height="475" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/protein-serving-size-713x475.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/protein-serving-size-300x200.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/protein-serving-size-600x400.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/protein-serving-size.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>*The 4 oz serving is for an uncooked piece of meat. Cooking reduces about 25% of the weight, bringing it down to about 3 oz.</em></p>
<p><b>If you’re curious, here’s how much protein is in a serving of food:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 oz (113 g) serving of chicken has around 30 g of protein.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 oz (113 g) serving of salmon has 23 g of protein</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 oz (113 g) of steak has 28 g of protein. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all of the Healthy Plate above is important, I want you to pay extra attention to your protein intake since we are trying to build muscle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re having trouble making your protein intake goals, check out our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide on Protein Supplements</a> for some tips and tricks to up your intake, including some awesome smoothie recipes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the exact strategy I followed to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/losing-the-last-20-pounds-7-lessons-learned-while-still-eating-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lose 22 pounds and get to single-digit bodyfat percentage</a> WHILE building muscle:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lift super heavy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat LOTS of protein.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce carb and fat intake.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If you are NOT losing weight, it means you are still eating too many calories.</strong> Keep your protein intake high, and reduce your fat and carbohydrate intake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cover this in greater detail in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“why can’t I lose weight?” guide</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, you’ll reach a status where there just isn’t enough fat on you to help with “Rebuild Muscle.” At this stage, you can no longer stay with a caloric deficit. You’ll need to flip to a slight “caloric surplus” to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-building-muscle-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build more muscle</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which means you’ll have to eat more.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3611175" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/turtle-eating.gif" alt="Like this turtle, you may reach a point where you have to eat more to gain muscle." width="450" height="253" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s debatable when this will actually occur, and we are all different. Reaching 8% body fat for men and 16% body fat for women is a good place to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talk about this extensively in our guide &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-building-muscle-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Build Muscle</a>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It covers ways to increase your calories for muscle gain, from eating plentiful amounts of <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleo foods</a> to drinking enough milk to make Santa Clause jealous.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611176" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/santa-milk.gif" alt="Santa is drinking milk to put on some muscle. The cookies are just because he likes them." width="339" height="339" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to stress that if you are lifting heavy, and not gaining muscle, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">diet is likely the culprit</span>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was my problem for years, and I’ve seen it amongst countless readers of Nerd Fitness who have trouble gaining muscle. </span></p>

<h2><a name="continue_to_lose_fat_gain_muscle"></a>HOW TO TELL IF IT’S ALL WORKING <b>(Continuing to Lose Fat While Gaining Muscle)</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611214 size-large" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/youth-jumping-713x475.jpg" alt="Now you're ready to start losing fat and gaining muscle!" width="713" height="475" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/youth-jumping-713x475.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/youth-jumping-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/youth-jumping-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/youth-jumping-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/youth-jumping.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><b>If you&#8217;re trying to improve something, it’s important to track it. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also holds true of body composition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people do this by jumping on the scale. This can be “Ok,” but it’s only going to tell part of the story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I explained muscle weighs more than fat, so if you are losing body fat and gaining muscle at the same time, you might actually weigh the same. Or even more! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite weighing more, you could potentially have a better physique.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611177" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/breakfast-club.gif" alt="Don't just look at the scale. You might have lost bodyfat and gained muscle, but the scale won't show it!" width="414" height="235" /></p>
<p><b>That’s why in addition to jumping on the scale, I would also encourage you to take progress photos. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take front and side photos in your mirror, wearing underwear or a bathing suit. Each week, take new photos, and record the number on the scale under the same scenario. Two forms of tracking here allow us to get the full picture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scale sometimes lies!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you eat for a caloric deficit, strength train, and prioritize protein, see what happens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may find yourself losing some fat and gaining muscle. </span></p>
<p><strong>If not, track each category:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Are you really in a caloric deficit?</strong> <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Track your calories to find out</a>.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are you lifting enough</a>?</strong> Track your compliance with never missing a workout and whether or not your progressing in increased weight or repetitions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Are you <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prioritizing protein in your meals</a>?</strong> Track your macronutrient breakdown each time you eat.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data can help tell the story.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3611215 " src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/data-star-trek.gif" alt="Data and numbers will help you know if you're losing fat and gaining muscle. Numbers, not the robot." width="374" height="335" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;I was thinking of detailed notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But an android would be helpful too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oftentimes if you’re not seeing desired results, notes and record keeping can help point us in the direction to make adjustments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test your assumptions if things don’t appear to be on track. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-track-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide on Tracking Fitness Progress</a> for you to learn more.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>&#8220;Dearest Steve, HOW does a barbell front squat differ from the <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-to-squat-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back squat</a>?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>Great question, gumshoe (can I call you &#8220;gumshoe?&#8221; Cool).</p>
<p><em>This section is going to rely heavily on the bible of barbell training, <a href="https://amzn.to/2lPiQyx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting Strength</a>, which I HIGHLY recommend you pick up if you&#8217;re serious about your training. </em></p>
<p>The differences between a barbell back squat and front squat is all due to the location of the bar with regards to the rest of your body.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3602510" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-713x465.png" alt="Your back position, knees, and shins are all used differently when comparing a front squat to back squat" width="549" height="358" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-713x465.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-300x196.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-768x501.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-600x391.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat.png 886w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></p>
<p><strong>Because you keep the weight over the middle of your feet in both movements, your body needs to adjust fairly dramatically to do a front squat when compared to a back squat (below photo from <em>Starting Strength)</em>:</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3601971" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-squat-vs-front-squat-713x516.png" alt="the front squat is very different than the back squat" width="545" height="394" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-squat-vs-front-squat-713x516.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-squat-vs-front-squat-300x217.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-squat-vs-front-squat-600x434.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-squat-vs-front-squat.png 741w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></p>
<p><strong>In a back squat,</strong> at the bottom of the squat your back is in a 45 degree angle<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>However, in a front squat, due to the fact that the weight is in front of you (duh)</strong>, resting on your shoulders, your torso and back need to be almost completely vertical throughout the movement to keep the weight stable!</p>
<p><strong>In addition, because your back is much more upright, this requires your hips to stay under the bar, your knees to extend out further, and also your ankles to be more activated (photo below from <em>Starting Strength)</em>! </strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3601977" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-Squat-Front-Squat-knee-placement-713x400.png" alt="Your knee position and ankles are very different with a front squat compared to a back squat" width="713" height="400" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-Squat-Front-Squat-knee-placement-713x400.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-Squat-Front-Squat-knee-placement-300x168.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-Squat-Front-Squat-knee-placement-768x431.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-Squat-Front-Squat-knee-placement-600x337.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Back-Squat-Front-Squat-knee-placement.png 998w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><strong>Other differences between a front squat and back squat:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You&#8217;ll lift LESS weight than a traditional back squat.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You might find front squats to be easier on your lower back than back squats, </strong>because you&#8217;ll be lifting less weight and your lower back is less engaged.</li>
<li><strong>Your quads are more engaged, your glutes are more engaged, and your hamstrings are LESS engaged </strong>due to your hips staying under the bar and your knees driving forward when you drop into a front squat.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Quads are the dominant muscle that have to do most of the heavy lifting in a front squat. </strong> Which means doing both front squats and back squats in your workouts is a great way to build very well developed legs and posterior.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The front squat is an exercise that requires quite a bit of mobility, experience, and strength to be able to pull it off correctly. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition, it&#8217;s important to learn how to bail safely out of a front squat before attempting it with a heavy weight, so it&#8217;s a lot more advanced than a traditional back squat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And if you can&#8217;t do a regular bodyweight squat correctly, there&#8217;s no way in hell we&#8217;re gonna have you start lifting heavy weight with improper form either!</p>

<p><strong>This exercise helps you start to develop improved wrist mobility, develops familiarity around having weight across the tops of your shoulders, and can be scaled with different sized dumbbells.</strong></p>
<p>The best advice I can give you on Dumbbell Front Squats: get those elbows up! This is one of the most important mobility challenges people have when it comes to doing front squats correctly: shoulder and wrist mobility to get the bar locked in the right place!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have LOTS of <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1-on-1 coaching clients</a> who are new to doing front squats, and it often comes down to ankle flexibility and hip mobility in order to do a front squat right. </span></p>

<p>*I don&#8217;t like Half-racks without adjustable safety bars &#8211; if you want to squat deep the barbell might hit the immovable bars! Not cool.</p>
<p>Aim for the A or B options if you have the choice.</p>
<p><strong>HUGE NOTE: a squat rack is NOT the same thing as a Smith Machine, where the barbell is attached to the machine, and slides up and down two bars:</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3584079" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/smith-machine.jpg" alt="Don't use the Smith Machine, unless it's for inverted rows at the gym." width="375" height="500" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/smith-machine.jpg 375w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/smith-machine-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p><strong>You do NOT want to do front squats in a Smith Machine. </strong>Because the bar can&#8217;t move horizontally (only vertically), it can put your spine and body in precarious positions and is NOT recommended.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need a completely unattached barbell in order to do a barbell squat properly and safely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friends don&#8217;t let friends squat in a Smith Machine</span>. </span></p>
<p><strong>#2) Next, s</strong><b>et the height of the bar to be about the same height as your collarbone. </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Not sure if you should set the squat rack pins higher or lower? </strong>It happens. If your options are either too high or too low, it’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always best</span> to set the pins <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slightly lower than you need them</span>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t want to have to get up on your toes to rack/unrack the bar, especially as the weight gets heavier.</span></p>

<p><strong>1) Step up to the bar, lift your arms, and place the bar on the meaty top/front of your shoulders resting close to your neck (not AGAINST your neck!)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Continue lifting your arms and wrap your hands around until you can use your fingers to keep the bar steady!</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your shoulder and write mobility, you might need to adjust your wrist location on the bar.</p>
<p><strong>This is a traditional front squat grip:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Most people can not front squat with all of your fingers wrapped around the bar, and instead will let the bar roll against their fingertips (a 2-3 finger grip is okay here).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your fingers are NOT doing any lifting in a front squat: </strong>They are merely there to keep the bar on the tops of your shoulders, and to keep the bar from rolling forward if your elbows start to accidentally drop down.</p>
<p>However, if you keep your chest puffed out (like King Kong about to pound his chest), and your elbows UP UP UP, you shouldn&#8217;t have any problem here.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3604474" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/King-Kong-Chest-Pound.gif" alt="Keep your shoulders back while doing your front squat, just like King Kong." width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>If you can&#8217;t get your fingers around the bar,</strong> there are a few variations you can start training with (specifically, the cross grip squat, which we cover below).</p>
<p>However, we do NOT recommend doing front squats with heavy weight until you can do them with proper form with your grip properly wrapped around the bar and elbows up.</p>
<p><em>Okay, you&#8217;re now ready to do the actual front squat movement.</em></p>
<p><strong>THE FRONT SQUAT MOVEMENT:</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="How to do a Proper Front Squat - Regular Grip" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bUTMmMtjOq4?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>1) Keep your spine tight, your body vertical, chest out and elbows UP UP UP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Lift the bar off the rack, and take one cautious step backward.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Your stance should be with your feet hip-width apart, with your toes pointed SLIGHTLY outward</strong> (if you have poor hip mobility or very long legs, you might need to squat with a slightly wider stance, that&#8217;s okay).</p>
<p><strong>4) Inhale deep into your belly, flex your stomach, and slowly lower your body until your thighs touch the back of your legs.</strong> If you don&#8217;t squat deep enough, it&#8217;s only a partial squat!</p>
<p><strong>5) Staying vertical, keeping your hips underneath the weight, and keeping those elbows UP HIGH, </strong>drive down through your feet and lift the weight back to its starting position.</p>

<p>Keeping your elbows as high as possible the entire time is extremely important in the front squat &#8211; as soon as you let them drop, the weight will likely pull you forward out of correct positioning, and you will either drop the weight or potentially get injured.</p>
<p><strong>If you can&#8217;t do a Front Squat with your arms in the position consider a &#8220;cross grip front squat&#8221; to START:</strong></p>
<p><iframe title="How to do a Proper Front Squat - Cross Grip" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ratk4lZKyI?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why should you not do front squats with cross grip forever? </strong>Because it&#8217;s tougher to control the bar at heavier weight without having your hands in a traditional front squat position.</p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;re going to start to lift heavy, you&#8217;re gonna need to learn how to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fail and bail from a front squat safely</span>.</em></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s very difficult to fail safely while doing a cross grip front squat.</p>
<p>So, sure! Feel free to start with a genie front squat to work on your squat movement, but don&#8217;t forget to work on that shoulder and wrist mobility too so you can do front squats properly.</p>

<p><strong>If you are going to squat, you have to know how to &#8220;fail&#8221; at squatting safely! </strong></p>
<p>This is where practice can REALLY come in handy. Set the safety pins at the right height, and then practice your bail at a safe weight (or with a PVC pipe) so that the movement becomes second nature if things go poorly!</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you watch the video above to learn how to bail safely with a front squat and back squat.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;ve been front squatting for about a decade, but I&#8217;m just one nerd. </strong>So I asked the coaches of our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/">Online Coaching Program</a> (with decades of experience between them) what big mistakes they see people make with front squats, both online and in person:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MISTAKE #1) Not staying vertical enough. </strong></span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never done front squats before, it&#8217;s a FUNKY maneuver.</p>
<p>You need to keep the weight over the middle of your feet &#8211; if you drew a line down from the bar to the floor, it should bisect your feet &#8211; which means you need to be significantly more vertical compared to a back squat.</p>
<p><strong>See it in the right image below:</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3602510" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-713x465.png" alt="Your back position, knees, and shins are all used differently when comparing a front squat to back squat" width="425" height="277" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-713x465.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-300x196.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-768x501.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat-600x391.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-vs-Back-Squat.png 886w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p>The tendency is to bend forward on a front squat, and this is a recipe for disaster!</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Film a video of yourself doing  front squats from the side, and note where the bar is in relation to your feet. Keep your chest puffed out (King Kong!) and elbows up!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MISTAKE #2) Not developing proper shoulder and wrist flexibility. </strong></span></p>
<p>If we had one more more common problem than the others, it&#8217;s that people don&#8217;t have the proper shoulder and wrist and arm mobility to be able to grab the bar properly with their fingers.</p>
<p>Although you CAN do a cross-grip front squat, it&#8217;s not recommended for heavy weights due to the fact that it&#8217;s more difficult to bail from this movement safely.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION: Grab the bar wider, or with fewer fingers.</strong> Just keep those elbows up!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3602584" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Grip-Wide-713x448.png" alt="If you have longer than average forearms or poor wrist mobility, grabbing the bar with a wider grip can help" width="436" height="274" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Grip-Wide-713x448.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Grip-Wide-300x189.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Grip-Wide-768x483.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Grip-Wide-600x377.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Grip-Wide.png 889w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<p>With each future workout, grab the bar with a slightly closer and closer to your shoulders, or with more fingers.</p>
<p>Develop that mobility!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MISTAKE #3) Not squatting deep enough: ankle and hip mobility.</strong></span></p>
<p>Most people have poor hip and ankle mobility &#8211; it&#8217;s from spending all day sitting in desk chairs or cars. This is the most common fault I see in gyms around the world: people doing a barbell squat and only dropping down a few inches and thinking it&#8217;s a full squat.</p>
<p><strong>We call this a &#8220;power curtsy:&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3604524" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/incorrect-front-squat.png" alt="Showing a front squat not going low enough." width="313" height="409" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/incorrect-front-squat.png 313w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/incorrect-front-squat-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t squat deep enough &#8211; until the tops of your thighs are parallel or lower, then you&#8217;re only doing half a repetition and cheating yourself!</p>
<p><strong>See the difference in depth between a half-rep and a VERY deep front squat below.</strong></p>
<p>You can go deep enough until the tops of your thighs are below parallel, and if you have the mobility and depth, until your hamstrings hit your calves:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3604526" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/correct-front-squat.png" alt="Make sure you go down low enough in your front squat, like so." width="388" height="409" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/correct-front-squat.png 388w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/correct-front-squat-285x300.png 285w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /></p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION: Take a slightly wider stance, and turn your feet out slightly more. </strong>This will help you squat deeper to start.</p>
<p>You can also do some ankle mobility drills to improve your ankle flexion!</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, spend more time sitting in a squat!</strong></p>
<p>I try to do up to 30 minutes per day sitting in the bottom of a squat (while watching TV, or while reading a book):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MISTAKE #4) Not learning to bail properly</span>. </strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re gonna get strong, you&#8217;re going to want to lift heavier and heavier things. Sometimes when you lift heavy things, you&#8217;re going to fail on that lift.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3569209" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/house-crap.gif" alt="If you lift enough you will reach a point where you have to bail out of your squat. Just know how to do it correctly!" width="378" height="212" /></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s part of lifting, so you might as well learn to bail correctly NOW!</strong> There&#8217;s nothing more scary than realizing you&#8217;re not gonna hit a lift and being trapped under a bar with no way of getting away from the weight safely!</p>
<p>Practice how to fail and bail so that you can have more confidence to try and succeed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MISTAKE #5) Pressing the weight against your throat. </strong></span></p>
<p>When you do a front squat, you have the bar resting across the tops of your shoulders, held in place by your fingers with your elbows up.</p>
<p><strong>However, the bar is also resting precariously close to your throat and your windpipe!</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3602685" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-713x383.png" alt="Doing a front squat places the bar very close to your neck" width="486" height="261" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-713x383.png 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-300x161.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-768x413.png 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location-600x323.png 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Front-Squat-Bar-Location.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></p>
<p>If you happen to get your elbows TOO high, or if you use your fingers to press the bar against your throat too much, you are in danger of restricting your air passage.</p>
<p><strong>Serious injury can occur if you manage to black out in a front squat due to the bar resting against your throat. </strong></p>
<p>If you happen to notice ANYTHING unusual with your vision, breathing, or awareness during a front squat lower the weights onto the safety bars or re-rack the weight and drop to one knee IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p><em>Get low to the ground in case you get light headed!</em></p>

<p><strong>Front squats are an AMAZING exercise, and you should now have everything you need to be able to confidently do front squats with correct form and proper technique.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m sure you have a few more questions: </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>#1) &#8220;How do I fit front squats into my workout? Where do they go?&#8221;</strong> </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If you are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-build-your-own-workout-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building your own workout</a>, feel free to alternate each squat workout with either a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-to-squat-properly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back squat</a> or a front squat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I train 4 days per week, and do higher rep back squats on Wednesdays, and then heavier, low rep front squats on Saturdays.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3604529" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/calendar.gif" alt="A solid strategy is to alternate between back and front squats!" width="397" height="215" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Depending on your situation, you might decide to ONLY do front squats moving forward, or ONLY back squats.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Check with your coach or your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-good-personal-trainer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal trainer</a> or whoever is building your program, or experiment yourself!</p>
<p><em><strong>#2) &#8220;How much weight should I lift when doing front squats?&#8221; </strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As we cover in our &#8220;<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-how-much-weight-should-i-be-lifting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how much weight should I lift?</a>&#8221; guide, always start with just the bar during your warm-up sets.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">And then slowwwwly, over many weeks, can you start to ramp up the weight.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your goal should be to <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101-where-do-i-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confidently build strength</a> each week while also improving your form each and every time too.</p>

<p><em><strong>#3) &#8220;Can you build a workout for me that has front squats, Steve?&#8221; </strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We do have a pretty killer <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-gym-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6-Level Gym Workout Program</a> that you can do front squats in.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Try to eat more organic vegetables watered by unicorn tears, farm-to-table meals served by centaurs, and kale omletes made with eggs from chickens that you raised since birth.”  </span></p>
<p><b>Okay so maybe people don’t say the last one. </b></p>
<p><b>But it’s not far from what healthy people say to people who can’t seem to get healthy.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my opinion, these positions are completely out of touch with reality and it makes me plum dog mad.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603571" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/angry.gif" alt="No one likes being told &quot;just eat better.&quot;" width="468" height="260" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, fast food is crazy delicious and dirt cheap, and often the only way that many busy parents can feed themselves and their kids<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, applying morality and guilt to food consumption (&#8220;I’m being &#8216;so bad&#8217; by eating this cookie”) creates an emotional rollercoaster &#8211; my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">least</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> favorite kind of roller coaster.</span></p>
<p><strong>I mean come on, we don’t need to be told that freshly grown fruits and veggies are better for us than junk food.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t need to be told that organic grilled chicken and kale salad is healthier than a Double Whopper with Cheese.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603598" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/obviously.gif" alt="Snape knows he should eat veggies to be healthy. But HOW DO YOU DO IT!" width="378" height="324" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know this! </span></p>
<p><b>So rather than “trying harder” to eat healthier we’re going to use things like “science” and “human psychology” and “excessive quotation marks.” </b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cool?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Here’s what you need to know: If you’re just trying to be healthier and maybe lose some weight,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s no need to start funneling kale smoothies, mainlining chicken and broccoli, and abandoning your loyalty to the Burger King.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lose weight and be healthy while still eating these foods occasionally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heck, people have lost weight by eating Twinkies<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and drinking soda and eating at McDonald’s 3 times per day<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I share this info not to promote those foods, but rather make a big point:</span></i></p>
<p><b>If you are terrified of giving up all “junk food”…</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not need to give up fast food if it brings you joy</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not need to feel shame for eating ice cream. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to use terms like “cheat meal” or “guilty pleasure” when talking about a chocolate chip cookie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food isn&#8217;t good or evil, my dear friend! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s just food! </span></p>
<p><b>Let’s bring it all together:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have certain health goals, we can give ourselves the best chance of success by getting strategic about what foods we say “YES” to, and what foods we say “SOMETIMES” to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These YES foods give us more energy and have fewer calories on average than “junk food,” which means we’re likely to eat fewer total calories without realizing it.</span></p>
<p><b>And thus, we end up with the Triforce of Awesome:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A longer lifespan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smaller waistline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A happier, healthier existence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3603605" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Triforce.gif" alt="Healthy eating can help you be awesome in multiple ways." width="500" height="212" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are these magical foods we’re talking about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought you’d never ask.</span></p>

<p><b>Removing all the morality and science of food, let’s talk about a realistic definition of “healthy food”:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Foods I can eat frequently that give me enough fuel to get through the day AND don’t make me miserable.”</span></p>
<p><b>Most doctors, websites, and books have generally the same list of “healthy foods”:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein like meat and legumes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh fruits and vegetables.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy carbohydrates like rice, quinoa.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy fats like almonds and olive oil.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasional cheese and dairy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more complete list of healthy foods is below).</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Why is it that these are the foods that happen to end up on every list on every website when it comes to “healthy eating?” </b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3604380" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pooh-thinking.gif" alt="Why do all sites advise more of less the same foods for a healthy diet?" width="350" height="189" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are full of vitamins and nutrients while also being lower in calories than the processed foods that have been designed to be overeaten<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also fill us up, making us feel satiated, and keep us under our calorie total for the day<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. </span></p>
<p><b>Now you’re starting to get it:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we can prioritize these foods on our plate even occasionally, we’ll feel full more often while eating fewer calories&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which leads to </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainable weight loss and maintenance</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603637" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/yes.gif" alt="This man is stoked he gets to lose weight sustainably through healthy eating...and punching his enemies. " width="377" height="236" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me drive this point about calories vs energy into your brain (not literally). </span></p>
<p><b>Here are 4 foods in the exact same quantity, 200 calories (courtesy of <a href="https://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-200-calories-look-like.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiseGEEK</a>):</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a huge plate of broccoli, also 200 calories:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3574949" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli.jpg" alt="A pic of 200 calories of broccoli" width="605" height="403" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli.jpg 605w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/what-200-calories-look-like-food-broccoli-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" /></p>
<p><b>In this context, the realization that we might overeat certain foods compared to others starts to become more clear:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we accidentally overeat broccoli</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we might eat an extra 20 calories. And who accidentally overeats broccoli?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we accidentally overeat spaghetti</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we might eat an extra 500-1000 calories. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If we accidentally eat a family-sized bag of Sour Patch Kids</span>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we might eat an extra 2000 calories (and have no tastebuds left on your tongue)<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-6" id="refmark-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Which brings me to the next point: </b></p>
<p><b>We humans are terrible at estimating how many calories we eat<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-7" id="refmark-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Like, really really bad at it. I bet the proportions of the above foods surprised you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We consistently eat much more than we realize, by 40%+.</span></p>
<p><b>To make matters worse, we also OVERestimate how many calories we burn through exercise.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study showed that Fitness trackers like AppleWatch or Fitbit overestimate exergy burned through exercise by 20% or more<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-8" id="refmark-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3596493" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/portlandia-fitbit.gif" alt="Our Fitbit trackers might not be super accurate when reporting calories burned. Take this into account when referencing your calorie needs." width="449" height="253" /></p>
<p><b>So when we “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/why-cant-i-lose-weight-heres-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can’t lose weight</a>,” it’s not because we have a broken metabolism. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not because we have bad genetics<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-9" id="refmark-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or that we’re not eating for our blood type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It’s because we consistently eat too much food without realizing it</span>.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603642" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/deadpool-ugh.gif" alt="Deadpool tries to match his calorie goals...when not saving the world and whatnot." width="298" height="298" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a ready supply of new energy from recently eaten food, more than we need, our body NEVER has to dip into our stored fat to burn for fuel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">think </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ve out-exercised our bad diet, we really haven’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s time to stop “trying harder” and instead “try differently”:</span></p>
<p><b>In order for us to get healthy, we need to find ways to include more foods that fill us up AND taste good.</b></p>

<p><b>There are three big macronutrients that we’re going to focus on as we build our plate like the image above:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protein:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building blocks for our muscles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Carbohydrates:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our bodies will burn as fuel. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fats:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be burned as fuel, and also helps with nutrition absorption!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>#1) </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>PROTEIN</b></span><b>: Priority Numero Uno. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein is amazing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your body uses protein to rebuild your muscles and keep you strong, especially if you are <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/25-ways-to-exercise-without-realizing-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exercising</a> or <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/strength-training-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strength training</a> regularly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein is both good for you AND satiating without being a calorie bomb. </span></p>
<p><b>Protein can come from any number of sources, including:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meat (steak, bison, pork).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fowl (chicken, turkey, duck).</span></li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>*The 4 oz serving is for an uncooked piece of meat. Cooking reduces about 25% of the weight, bringing it down to about 3 oz.</em></p>
<p><b>When building a plate, aim for the following amount of protein:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudes: 1-2 servings (6-8 oz or about 170-228 g): two palms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudettes: 1 serving (3-4 oz or about 85-114 g): 1 palm.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>If you’re curious, here’s how much protein is in a serving of food:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 oz (113 g) serving of chicken has around 30 g of protein.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 oz (113 g) serving of salmon has 23 g of protein</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 oz (113 g) of steak has 28 g of protein. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we cover in our “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how much protein should I eat per day?</a>” you can target anywhere from 80% to 100% of your bodyweight in pounds per gram of protein, with an upper limit of 250g<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-11" id="refmark-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you weigh 200 pounds (90 kg), target 160-200g of protein.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you weigh 250 pounds (113 kg), target 200-250g of protein.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, they are energy-dense but calorie-light, which means you can eat lots of them, you’ll feel full, but you’re unlikely to over-consume calories.</span></p>

<p><b>#4) </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>HEALTHY FATS</b></span><b>: No longer the enemy!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fat had a bad rep in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, but now things are swinging wayyyyy back in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some circles, fat is now considered the healthiest thing on the planet, will do your taxes for you, and is considered a superfood.</span></p>
<p><b>Let’s get to the truth:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fat is neither a superfood nor evil. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603668" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dr-evil.gif" alt="Fat can be part of a healthy diet, and is not evil, to the frustration of Dr. Evil." width="443" height="188" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s just a macronutrient that you can eat that can help you reach your goals in the right quantity, or keep you from your goals if it’s overconsumed.</span></p>
<p><b>When your doctor tells you to eat more healthy fats, she’s referring to polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-15" id="refmark-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Healthy fat can be found in foods like:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avocado </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almonds </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walnuts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macadamia nuts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olive oil</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almond butter </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peanut butter</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Now, science has recently come around on saturated fat too</b><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-16" id="refmark-16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; once completely vilified, but now cautiously considered okay for moderate consumption. </span></p>
<p><b>Saturated fats can come from things like:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whole milk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full fat dairy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coconut oil</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grass-fed butter</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lard</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatty cuts of meat</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fat can be good for you provided you’re eating the right quantity for your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, like carbs, fats can be overconsumed accidentally too. </span></p>
<p><b>To help you gauge: a serving size of fat is roughly the size of your thumb!</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, if you’re not careful &#8211; you can accidentally eat an extra 500 calories of “healthy fats” by absentmindedly eating too many “heart-healthy” fats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many folks in our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coaching Program</a> had us analyze why they weren’t losing weight, even though they “only ate grilled chicken and veggies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we dug into it, they had been preparing all of their food in an extra 500-600 calories worth of olive oil they weren’t accounting for. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603643" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/doh.gif" alt="Homer just realized he eats too much olive oil. " width="376" height="287" /></p>
<p><b>To recap fats and starchy carbs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feel free to include a starchy portion to your plate in the form of rice, potatoes, pasta, or legumes, and healthy fats can help spice up a meal too. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lentils and legumes mean your protein and your carbs are attached at the hip. Swell.</span></li>

<p><b>So, simply be aware of the calories (and carb and fiber content if you’re following a lower carb diet):</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple: 95 cal, 25g carbs, 4.4g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banana: 105 cal, 27g carbs, 3.1g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange: 45 cal, 11g carbs, 2.3g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pear: 100 cal, 28g carbs, 3g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peach: 59 cal, 14g carbs, 2.3g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strawberries (1 cup): 47 cal, 11g carbs, 3g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pineapple (1 cup): 82 cal, 22g carbs, 2.3g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grapes (1 cup): 62 cal, 16g carbs, 0.8g fiber. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raspberries (1 cup): 65 cal, 15g carbs, 8 fiber. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Fruit is a better, healthier alternative to nutrient-empty food from a vending machine.</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603648" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/homer-vending-machine.gif" alt="Fruit is healthier than what you'll find in a vending machine, plus you'll lower your chance of getting stuck in one." width="408" height="308" /></p>
<p><b>Where fruit can get you in trouble is if you start to move in the direction of “fruit-like”:</b></p>
<p><b>#1) Fruit juices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (cranberry juice, orange juice, grape juice): these are high calorie, sugar-filled beverages. </span></p>
<p><b>For example, here are the calories in one </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>8 oz</b></span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-17" id="refmark-17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></span><b> serving of: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Juice: 103 calories, 22 g of sugar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange Juice: 103 calories, 18 g of sugar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grape Juice: 136 calories, 32 g of sugar</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>#2) Dried fruit:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notoriously easy to overeat because they are so small. Since the water has been taken out, all that’s left is the sugar and fiber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s 1 serving of raisins, which is 108 calories and 21 g of sugar:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603882" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/raisins-713x475.jpg" alt="Since the water is taken out, raisins have a lot of sugar and calories. " width="501" height="334" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/raisins-713x475.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/raisins-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/raisins-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/raisins-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/raisins.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“oh man, I eat 5x that many raisins when I eat them…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” then multiply those calorie and sugar numbers by 5!</span></p>
<p><b>3) Fruit Smoothies:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just because it’s a fruit smoothie doesn’t mean it won’t make you fat! Have you seen the calorie count and sugar content of smoothies and ‘green drinks’? Yikes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Machine Naked Juice (15.2 oz or 450 ml bottle): 270 calories, 53 g of sugar.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoothie King Banana Boat (20 oz or 591 ml smoothie): 450 calories, 70 g of sugar.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3604321" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spit-up-drink.gif" alt="A man realizing how much sugar is in his drink." width="298" height="205" /></p>
<p><b>To recap: fruit is healthy, provided you stick to fresh or frozen and not fruit-like food, dried fruit, or canned fruit packed in syrup. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you enjoy a small glass of orange juice occasionally, or you pack a serving of raisins in your lunch and it makes life worth living, by all means! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just don’t chug OJ by the gallon, drink a 64 oz “real fruit smoothie,” and eat raisins by the handful and then wonder why you’re not losing weight.</span></p>
<h2><a name="dairy"></a>Are Cheese and Dairy healthy?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3603731" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lego-with-cheese-713x475.jpg" alt="Is cheese and dairy part of a healthy diet?

<p><b>We get questions about these two types of food frequently. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me start by saying I’m assuming you’re not doing <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-paleo-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleo</a> (which says “NO dairy and NO cheese”), or <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-eat-a-plant-based-diet-a-scientific-look-at-going-vegan-safely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plant-based</a> (which says NO to all animal products).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll also assume you’re not doing <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-the-keto-diet-or-ketogenic-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keto</a>, which almost requires you to load up on dairy and cheese to eat enough fat every day! </span></p>
<p><b>Let’s pretend you’re just curious if cheese and/or dairy can be consumed on a “healthy diet:”:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YES</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can still eat cheese and be healthy.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YES</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can still eat dairy and be healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there was much rejoicing:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603650" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/school-hooray.gif" alt="Yes, both dairy and cheese can be part of a healthy diet. Rejoice!" width="385" height="268" /></p>
<p><strong>Like the healthy carbs and fats listed above, it all comes down to your calories consumed in a day, and if these foods fit into your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily calorie goals:</a></strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to put cheese on top of your salad of chicken and vegetables? Great! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to eat greek yogurt, a <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scoop of protein powder</a>, and frozen berries for your breakfast? Amazing! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to eat a bowl of cereal with skim milk (or whole milk) in the morning with your kid before school? No problem.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is true for higher-fat cheeses or full-fat dairy too &#8211; the food just needs to fit into your goals! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, all dairy comes labeled, and most cheese will come with a nutrition label on it too. </span></p>
<p><b>Just make sure your portions are in line. For reference, here are four different servings of cheddar cheese (about 113 calories a serving):</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603906" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/serving-of-cheddar.jpg" alt="A serving of cheddar cheese is about 113 calories.

<p><b>And here’s a serving of greek yogurt (100 calories in 170 grams):</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603907" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greek-yogurt-713x535.jpg" alt="a cup of greek yogurt is about 100 calories," width="409" height="307" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greek-yogurt-713x535.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greek-yogurt-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greek-yogurt-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greek-yogurt-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/greek-yogurt.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></p>
<p><b>And although nobody in the history of the world has ever eaten an actual serving&#8230;here is a serving of ice cream:</b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603913" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ice-cream-713x559.jpg" alt="A serving of ice cream is about the size of a tennis ball, cleverly shown here." width="437" height="343" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ice-cream-713x559.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ice-cream-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ice-cream-768x602.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ice-cream-600x470.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></p>
<p><em><b> (A scoop of ice cream the size of a tennis ball is about 127 calories, cleverly shown above.)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, dairy and cheese are both perfectly acceptable health food options! Just make sure they fit into your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are NOT losing weight, and you consume a lot of dairy and/or cheese, consider measuring your intake and see if it’s in line with your expectations! </span></p>

<p><b><i>“Low fat diets? Low carb diets? No carb diets? I don’t know which one is the BEST diet!” </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Help me, Steve Kamb, you’re my only hope.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, you’re probably not saying that, but it’s an excuse to pay homage to Star Wars so I can use the great photo above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably do have questions though about what’s healthier, a low fat diet or a low carb diet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low carb diets are all the rage right now, but are they healthy and will they help you <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-not-suck-at-losing-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lose weight</a>? </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3603654" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maybe-1.gif" alt="Will a low carb diet help you lose weight? Maybe!" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p><b>Maybe. </b></p>
<p><b>It depends on h</b><b>ow your body regulates glucose (blood sugar)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-18" id="refmark-18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some who don’t regulate glucose well do better on a lower carb diet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others who do regulate glucose well might do better on a lower fat diet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies show that people who follow </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EITHER</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a low fat </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OR</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a low carb diet will still lose weight, as long as they are in caloric restriction and can adhere to the diet for at least a year<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-19" id="refmark-19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it comes down to: “which diet are you more likely to stick with for a year or longer?”</span></p>
<p><b>I personally lost <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/losing-the-last-20-pounds-7-lessons-learned-while-still-eating-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22 pounds over 6 months on a lower fat diet</a> (and eating plenty of carbs), but everybody is different.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you’ll need to experiment and see which is better for your lifestyle, and your day to day well-being.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><b>Let’s look at each of these diets and explain why they will help you lose weight, at least temporarily:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Truth #1:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Every diet works in the short term.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Truth #2:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nearly every diet fails in the long term.</span></p>
<p><b>Let’s address these two truths individually: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">every diet work</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short term</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3604349" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thinking-ape.gif" alt="Why DO diets work in the short term? This ape wants to know so he can eat healthy." width="353" height="282" /></p>
<p><b>All the diets above have a clever way of restricting calories without you needing to count calories, which leads to weight loss: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Paleo Diet:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eliminate everything but veggies, meat, fruit, and nuts. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Intermittent Fasting:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> skip an entire meal!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Keto Diet:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remove an entire macronutrient from your diet (carbs).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Military Diet: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only eat specific foods in certain quantities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Plant-based Diet:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Only eat vegetables and foods from plants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Carnivore Diet:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Only eat meat! Eliminate everything else. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course there are plenty of benefits from following certain diets for certain groups of people. For example, <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-larry-beat-rheumatoid-arthritis-and-got-strong-as-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry went Keto</a> and it helped him reduce inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, 99% of the reason why these diets result in short term weight loss is because they get us to eat fewer calories! </span></p>
<p><b>The problems arise when we get to Truth 2: </b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nearly every diet fails in the long term.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put another way: </span></p>
<p><b>Temporary changes create temporary results. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If somebody “goes Keto” for 60 days, they’ll most likely lose weight, and might even feel better! This is cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BUT! </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(There’s always a but…)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they spend those 60 days in misery, dreaming of carbs, counting down the meals until they can “go back to eating like normal,” they will put all of the weight back.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603657" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/luke-no.gif" alt="The weight loss you obtain through diet will only stick as long as you stay on that diet." width="423" height="238" /></p>
<p><b>In order for restrictive diets to create permanent results for somebody, they need to be adopted PERMANENTLY! </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of us mere mortals, we can’t stick with a restrictive diet for 30 days, let alone a year or a decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these reasons, I strongly advise you to change how you think about dieting.</span></p>
<p><b>You need to determine how likely you are to stick with a restrictive diet permanently:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How averse are you to change?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How likely are you to stick with your changes?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you tried a restrictive diet in the past and failed?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a healthy relationship with food?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have an “All or nothing?” mindset?</span></li>

<p><b>Like playing a video game, you need to determine what level of difficulty you are willing to attempt. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing on “Ultra Hard Difficulty” (like Keto) gives you less room for error, but it can also produce impressive results quickly &#8211; if you don’t rage quit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And 99% of people rage quit restrictive diets like Keto.</span></p>
<p><b>So what’s the best diet for you?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll give you the same answer that I give people when they ask me, “<a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-determine-your-perfect-workout-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What’s the best workout plan?</a>”: </span></p>

<p><b>Personally, I don’t follow any sort of restrictive diet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a big fan of small changes that eventually produce big results, like my boy Optimus Prime:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3568867" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/optimus-prime.gif" alt="Optimus Prime wants you to eat healthy." width="400" height="308" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why I’ve SLOWWWWLY <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/paleo-keto-slow-carb-vegan-how-to-determine-the-perfect-diet-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjusted my diet over the past decade</a>, so that no change was too drastic and I could stick with it permanently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a diet. It’s a lifestyle change. Permanently.</span></p>
<p><b>And that’s what I would recommend for you:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small, non-scary, permanent changes over a long time period! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to start thinking in terms of “days and years,” not “weeks and months:”</span></p>

<p><b>Okay! Now that you’ve determined your healthy eating strategy, it’s time to take action. </b></p>
<p><b>There are three big steps you’ll want to master if this is your path: </b></p>
<p><b>Step #1: Grocery Shopping! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read our full guide on “</span><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/cooking-101-how-to-navigate-a-grocery-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>How to grocery shop</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, and we even have a video that keeps things fun too:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Grocery Store" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLvkCoWhAI8?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.nerdfitness.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Here’s how to grocery shop like a pro:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Stick mostly to the outer rim.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This means you’re mostly buying meat, fruit, and veggies<a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-20" id="refmark-20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Read the nutrition label!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just because it says it’s healthy on the front doesn’t mean it is. <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-to-read-a-nutrition-label-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the nutrition label</a> and learn portion sizes. This can help keep you below your <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-every-day-a-look-at-total-daily-energy-expenditure-tdee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daily calorie goal</a>. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Don’t shop hungry!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Seems silly, but you end up buying way more junk food accidentally if you shop while hangry (a mix of hungry-angry, never a great emotion).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make a list.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before you go grocery shopping, write down everything you should get. You can even put “non-healthy” food items on the list. But then you can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buy what’s on your list! This means no candy in the check-out aisle. Or because Oreos are on sale! Plan ahead. Stick to the script, sister.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step #2: Learn to cook! </b></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3558839 size-full" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chef_gif-1.gif" alt="Once you get cooking you'll feel like the Swedish Chef. " width="500" height="200" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next section we share recipes for <a href="#healthy_eating_meals">basic healthy meals</a> that you can cook at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s why cooking at home is amazing: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>You know all of the ingredients.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you eat at restaurants or pick up fast food, there are often hidden calories in the cooking oils and sauces that are sabotaging your healthy efforts. Because of this, it’s really hard to have an idea of how many calories you’re consuming. When you prepare food at home, you know what you’re getting.</span></li>
<li><b>You can recreate healthier versions of your favorite foods. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Making homemade tacos or pizza with homemade dough can be a great date-night experience, makes your stomach happy, AND can help you reach your goals! </span></b></li>
<li><b>You save money.</b> If your budget is tight, grocery shopping and cooking your own meals is a great way to balance your budget and free up some cash! Our most successful <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coaching clients</a> work with their coaches on building the habit of cooking at home.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, if you’re somebody who only ever uses your kitchen to heat up microwave meals, that’s no problem. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3604350" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/microwave.gif" alt="You can get by eating healthy with just a microwave!" width="416" height="234" /></p>
<p><b>Here are the guides you should check out: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/cooking-101-your-essential-kitchen-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooking 101: Essential Kitchen Tools</a>: Not sure what kind of knives to get, or what you REALLY need? I’ve been there. Which is why we created this guide for you! </span></li>

</ul>
<p><b>Step #3 (BONUS): Meal Prep and Batch Cooking! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This step isn’t necessary, but if your goal is to make healthy eating a habit for you and your family, batch cooking can be the difference maker! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By “batch cooking,” I simply mean setting aside time to prepare larger quantities of food at the start of the week, so that throughout the week you already have meals to eat!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/losing-the-last-20-pounds-7-lessons-learned-while-still-eating-carbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">batch cooking changed my life</a>.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603676" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sheep-giving-thumbs-up.gif" alt="Batch cooking can change your life, as this sheep knows!" width="309" height="243" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And every single success story we’ve featured on Nerd Fitness (</span><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/how-mark-adjusted-his-mindset-learned-to-meal-prep-and-lost-65-pounds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) involved some sort of batch cooking (planning your meals for the week ahead). </span></p>

<h2><a name="commit_to_healthy_eating"></a>Will You Commit to Healthy Eating?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3568874" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Batman-knows-his-big-why-713x400.jpg" alt="When not fighting crime, Batman eats healthy." width="713" height="400" srcset="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Batman-knows-his-big-why-713x400.jpg 713w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Batman-knows-his-big-why-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Batman-knows-his-big-why-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Batman-knows-his-big-why-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<p><b>As we start to wrap up this guide, I have one BIG final question for you:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why the hell are you reading this?” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry to be so blunt, but your answer matters! </span></p>
<p><b>If you are trying to eat better because somebody </b><b><i>told you to</i></b><b>, or because you think you </b><b><i>should</i></b><b>, you’re setting yourself up to fail.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be excited and motivated to eat healthy today, and that’s great! </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3604351" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/apes-dancing.gif" alt="The start of a new activity, even a diet, can be very exciting as these apes know!" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But next week, Oscar in Accounting will put cake in front of you at work, and ask you to “live a little” and eat some cake “just this once.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then you’ll discover apps are half-priced at Chatchki’s during happy hour, and you figure “well I already had cake, might as well split some shrimp poppers and extreme fajitas with Meredith.”</span></p>
<p><b>This is how it always happens: <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/motivation-youre-doing-it-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motivation abandons us</a> when we need it most. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then one “ehh” choice becomes three bad choices which becomes “crap, I failed at my diet! I’m a loser. Okay I’ll just try harder next month&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are committed to this goal of eating healthier, you need a DAMN good reason to start eating healthier in the first place!</span></i></p>
<p><b>Here are some examples you can build off of:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to look better naked and start dating again.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to do epic stuff like running my first 5K.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to die early like my dad did.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to find out what I’m capable of.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to feel pride, not shame, when I look in the mirror.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>There are many tough days ahead, many happy hours, and sabotaging coworkers. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a great reason WHY can be the light in the darkness that helps you navigate the maze of temptation.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603785" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Frodo.gif" alt="Frodo isn't afraid of the dark...or eating unhealthy." width="364" height="238" /></p>
<p><b>In our <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/coaching-overview-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nerd Fitness Coaching program</a>, we call this “The Big Why,” and <a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-10-key-differences-between-weight-loss-success-and-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having a reason can be the difference</a> between success and failure:</b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our Big Why</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that stops us from living emotionally and chasing instant gratification from a donut or six slices of pizza when we’re sad or stressed.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our Big Why</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows us to say “Yes, I can have a slice of pizza, because I planned for it in my ‘calorie budget’ today. I’m not gonna feel bad about it either, because my breakfast tomorrow is gonna be great.”</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our Big Why</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows us to get back on track after a vacation or after just one day of poor eating, instead of letting things slide for a week or a month.  </span></p>
<p><b>Have your Big Why, and remind yourself of it constantly!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write it down, put it on a post-it note on your bathroom mirror, staple it to your forehead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But have a REASON you’re committing to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be crucial when life starts to get busy next week and you want to give up. So let’s talk about next week (and beyond!)</span></p>

<p><b>Healthy eating will change your life. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it needs to fit INTO your life too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small changes, not dramatic shifts!</span></p>
<p><b>You don’t have to give up the foods you love, you just need to PLAN for them.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to make a plate like we <a href="#healthy_food_list">lay out in this guide</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritize protein, and always put a fruit or vegetable on your plate before filling the rest of it up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will get you 90% of the way towards a great healthy eating strategy.</span></p>
<p><strong>And when in doubt, whenever you’re not sure if you should eat a particular food, ask yourself “What would Batman do?”</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3603663" src="https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/batman.gif" alt="Ask yourself &quot;What would Batman eat?&quot;" width="412" height="270" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously, this has been studied with children, and it helped them make healthier food choices by giving the decision making over to somebody they looked up to <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-22" id="refmark-22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>. It&#8217;s called &#8220;self-distancing,&#8221; and there&#8217;s no reason it can&#8217;t work for you too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and when you eat a bad meal &#8211; who cares?! “Never two in a row,” right? Make the next meal healthy. </span></p>
<p><b>YOUR MISSION, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT: </b></p>
<p><b>Start eating healthy today with literally one change:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try a new vegetable.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cut one soda out of your day. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritize protein in your next meal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap out one high calorie drink for a zero calorie drink.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t care what the change is, just as long as you make one!</span></p>
<p><b>Okay enough about me, let’s talk about you: </b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the ONE change you’re going to make today?</span></i></p>
