Particularly when it comes to breast-feeding, we hear more about the “don’ts” than the “dos.” <em>Don’t take allergy medicine! Don’t touch that sushi!</em> But how much science is backing these rules? What should you avoid, what’s okay to have in moderation, and what rules are flat-out myths? <a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/colorado-denver-boulder-mountain-northern/clinicians/sharman-reed-5368296">Sharman L. Reed</a>, MD, an OB/GYN at Kaiser Permanente, says that there are fewer things to avoid when breastfeeding than when pregnant. “While you’re pregnant, you’re sharing a blood supply with your baby,” Reed says. But in breastfeeding, you’re effectively just making a smoothie for your baby. Less is being converted over that goes in the baby’s gut.” The World Health Organization recommends new moms <a href="https://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/">breastfeed for up to six months, but when to stop is ultimately a personal choice.</a></p><p>Pediatrician Natasha Burgert, MD, FAAP, National Spokesperson for the<a href="https://healthychildren.org/"> American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and an expert for <a href="https://www.usa.philips.com/c-m-mo/baby-bottles-nipples">Philips Avent</a>, explains that when doctors advise mothers to avoid certain foods, medicines, or activities during breastfeeding, there are two reasons <strong>:</strong> They either make milk production hard or they affect the quality of the milk. When it comes to quality, she says most moms think that if they indulge in something on the “avoid when breastfeeding” list, such as a glass of wine or roll of sushi, they’ll need to “dump and pump” to get any toxins from the mercury or alcohol out of the milk. But that’s not exactly true.</p><p>“There’s a common misconception there,” she says. “When they think about breast milk production, people assume that the milk is made and it just stays there until it comes out, and then more is made. But it’s not like a Coke machine. Breast milk is a living dynamic organ in itself when it’s still in the breast, and it’s impacted by hormone fluctuations.”</p><p>Basically, just because you eat or do something on the “avoid” list, it generally doesn’t mean you need to totally drain your breasts and start anew with your breast milk making. Ultimately, breastfeeding is complicated. There are rules, yes, but there’s more gray area than you might think.</p><p>That’s why we asked experts to help us create the ultimate guide to answer your “can I have…” questions about breastfeeding.</p><p><h3>Alcohol</h3></p><p>You can have it in moderation, but realize that if you feel drunk, your milk might have alcohol in it.</p><p>“When you have a glass of wine, your blood alcohol level goes up, and then it goes back down after an hour or so” Burgert says. “The same happens in the content in the breast milk.” The milk isn’t stationary. “It’s not like: You have a beer, and the alcohol is going to stay in the milk until you pump and dump it,” Burgert says. “It’s a dynamic process.” So, it’s okay to drink alcohol, but if you feel drunk, you shouldn’t feed your baby. Try feeding your baby before you drink, and having a supply of already pumped milk on hand so you won’t have to feed your baby after a glass or two of wine.</p><p><h3><strong>Allergy medicine</strong></h3></p><p>When it comes to medicine, Burgert says most moms have issues with antihistamines. “What dries up your nose is going to dry up your boobs,” she says. As such, allergy season can be rough on moms. She says you can still do nasal sprays.</p><p><h3>Birth control pills</h3></p><p>Reed says it’s true that some oral contraceptives, especially ones with <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/estrogen-levels-change">progesterone and estrogen,</a> can decrease milk production. “But looking at studies for moms on oral contraception, those babies gain the same amount of weight in the same amount of time,” Reed says. “They think those babies maybe drink more deeply during nursing sessions. So, while production may decrease, the babies growing just as well.” If you struggle with milk supply, you may want to talk to your doctor about alternative kinds of contraception.</p><p><h3><strong>Botox</strong></h3></p><p>There isn’t a lot of research out there, about botox and breastfeeding, Reed says. “The amounts they use are probably small, but botox hangs out for three to four months in your tissues, and could potentially go to the breast milk,” she says. “If you have a choice to delay using it and can look for topical alternatives, it’s something we’d likely recommend waiting on.”</p><p><h3><strong>Caffeine</strong></h3></p><p>Burgert says this one is up to the mom. Caffeine won’t hurt your child, but it may have effects on them. “I have moms who will have a latte, and they swear their baby will get jittery,” Burgert says. “But then there are moms who drink five Starbucks a day and they say their kids is fine. It all depends on how the baby metabolizes it. Babies can metabolize caffeine.” You basically just need to watch and see if it makes your baby uncomfortable.</p><p><h3><strong>Cigarettes</strong></h3></p><p>“I have mothers who say they’re not going to nurse because they smoke cigarettes,” Reed says. However, she says that she encourages mothers who smoke to still nurse, while trying to quit. There’s no contraindication, and breastfeeding has been shown to protect your baby from other issues along they way.</p><p><h3><strong>Dairy</strong></h3></p><p>Go forth and enjoy your yogurt. Burgert says this is fine to have, and it’s even good for the baby to eat foods that people can develop allergies to “The more diverse that moms keep their diet, the more their babies will transition to eating their first foods without issues,” Burgert says. “They’re getting proteins and food particles from the milk. So, if you want to prevent peanut, dairy, or soy allergies, this is a good way. You want them to get exposed to all of those foods throughout the first six months of their life.”</p><p><h3><strong>Eating your placenta</strong></h3></p><p>You’ve heard of celebrities such as <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/09/14/chrissy-teigen-ate-her-placenta-after-birth-son-miles/1302840002/">Chrissy Teigen</a> and <a href="https://www.eonline.com/de/news/723850/kim-kardashian-reveals-plans-to-eat-her-placenta">Kim Kardashian</a> who ate their placentas. But just because someone famous does it, it doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. For one thing, Reed says it slow your milk production because it has progesterone and other hormones in it. Meanwhile, the CDC did a study that linked one <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6625a4.htm?s_cid=mm6625a4_e#contribAff">baby’s bacterial infection</a> with capsules the mother was taking that contained her dehydrated placenta.</p><p><h3><strong>Exposure to sun</strong></h3></p><p>When it comes to breastfeeding, Reed says hydration is a major factor. Being in the sun for too long can <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/feeling-fatigue-tired-after-sun">dehydrate you</a>, so you just need to make sure that you’re rehydrating afterwards. (And make sure your conscientious about sun exposure for you and your baby, for general reasons).</p><p><h3><strong>Fish and Sushi</strong></h3></p><p>This one is similar to alcohol. Avoid it if you can, and if you are going to have a bit of fish, feed your baby first so it can get out of your system by the next feeding. Just as potentially harmful mercury found in fish can be passed from the mother to the baby during pregnancy via the placenta, the same is true with breast milk, though in smaller amounts, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/environmental-exposures/mercury.html">according to the CDC</a>. The exposure could impact a baby’s brain and nervous system. Reed notes that some fish are okay, but fish that eat other fish (like mackerel) should be avoided.</p><p><h3><strong>Garlic</strong></h3></p><p>Although some outlets report that garlic makes your <a href="https://www.babygaga.com/15-things-that-will-influence-moms-breastmilk/">breast milk taste bad</a>, Reed says that it’s not harmful to your baby, and they’ll usually adjust. “That’s just what your diet is,” she says “Newborns like to be fed. And if you’ve ever tasted commercial formula, that tastes fouler than any amount of garlic in milk could.”</p><p><h3><strong>Gluten</strong></h3></p><p>Similarly to soy, this is okay for moms to have — unless they have Celiac disease, or a gluten allergy that causes gastrointestinal inflammation and issues. Then you can avoid for your own health reasons.</p><p><h3><strong>Hair Dye</strong></h3></p><p>There isn’t tons of research out there, but the American Pregnancy Association says it’s okay to dye and highlight your hair while breastfeeding. Dyes aren’t highly toxic, so while some might be absorbed into your skin, it’s unlikely it will make its way to the milk.</p><p><h3><strong>Hot yoga</strong></h3></p><p>Similarly to sun exposure, you should be okay to indulge in this relaxing and sweaty activity — as long as you rehydrate.</p><p><h3><strong>Isotretinoin (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-6661/accutane-oral/details">Accutane)</a></strong></h3></p><p>When it comes to this acne medication, the medical community says there’s a link between the high levels of vitamin A in the medicine and how babies form early on. “We don’t want you to get pregnant taking Accutane, which is why women need to be on effective contraceptives when taking it,” Reed says. There’s not much data regarding taking it during breastfeeding, Reed says, but topical treatments for acne are preferable.</p><p><h3><strong>Pain medicine</strong></h3></p><p>“Having a baby is uncomfortable, no matter how you do it,” Reed says. Most moms need some kind of pain medication, and Ibuprofen or Tylenol sometimes do the trick. Reed says these are fine to take when breastfeeding.</p><p>She also notes that you can take narcotic while breastfeeding. It depends on your baby, and you should consult your doctor, but usually you can also take narcotics or opioids when breastfeeding. “Even moms who are on high levels of opioids or who are on monitor programs who are recovering from a problem, we want them to be breastfeeding, there’s no contraindication at all. Breastfeeding is for everybody, even with complicated things going on.”</p><p><h3><strong>Marathon training or other intense workouts</strong></h3></p><p>Reed is based in Colorado, so a fair amount of her patients are serious athletes. She says that as long as you’re replacing you’re getting proper nutrition to make up for the energy you’re burning during training, and staying super hydrated, you should still be able to do intense workouts.</p><p>However, it’s important to listen to your body, and know when you need to switch something up if you’re having issues with milk production.</p><p><h3><strong>Retinol</strong></h3></p><p>Usually topical treatments don’t get into your tissue, so Reed and Burgert say it’s usually okay to use those while breastfeeding. However, you may want to talk with your doctor before you use <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tog.12075">prescription Retinoid</a>.</p><p><h3><strong>Soy</strong></h3></p><p>You can have it. Mayo Clinic says it’s a good way to get in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/breastfeeding-nutrition/art-20046912">protein via a plant source.</a> </p><p><h3><strong>Spicy Foods</strong></h3></p><p>“There are some myths about spicy foods and peppers and breastfeeding,” Reed says. “The truth is most women in other parts of the world are living on a spicier, garlic-ier, more exciting and aromatic diet, and those women are still breastfeeding their babies, there are few types of foods not to eat, other than some fish.”</p><p><h3><strong>Weed</strong></h3></p><p>This is one of the few things on the list that Reed says you shouldn’t do. Because of the way marijuana is processed in the body, it stays in your system for a long time — and in the breast milk. Research is still limited, but <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/bfm.2017.0020">some studies</a> suggest that it can be passed along to the baby in the milk, and cause developmental or <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/clac/2012/00000003/00000003/art00004">learning</a> difficulties. Although there could be more research on the topic, it’s better to avoid toking up while you’re breastfeeding. “We don’t want you to do that,” Reed says. “Ever.”</p><p><strong>Like what you see?

And while you hopefully recycle regularly and have given up disposable plastic grocery bags for a cute <a href="https://baggu.com/">Baggu</a>, you would probably be shook at how much plastic has quietly infiltrated almost every product in our beauty routines. (I would know, because I was.)</p><p>Last <a href="https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/">month</a>, I challenged myself to swap my entire beauty routine — hair, skin, makeup – for packaging- and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/plastic-free-beauty-products">plastic-free products</a>. And mind you, as an oily-skinned, extremely acne-prone beauty writer, I tend to cling to my routine like it's a life raft in the middle of a tidal wave. Sure, my job involves testing new stuff all the time, but a total top-to-bottom overhaul? I prepared for my skin to be very unhappy, to put it mildly.</p><p>That said, if we <em>know</em> that plastic is no bueno, why aren't more people weeding it out of their routine? Well, if you're like me, there's an emotional attachment to the products we put on our skin every day, and changing things up can be scary in a small-scale way. "There are hygienic and regulatory reasons for packaging in the personal care and beauty space, [but] I also know many of us look at package-free beauty products the same way some look at shopping for food from the bulk bins," <a href="http://www.ashleepiper.com/">Ashlee Piper</a>, sustainability expert and author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Give-Sh-Good-Better-Planet/dp/0762464488/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=give+a+shit&qid=1548180543&sr=8-1#customerReviews">Give a Sh*t: Do Good. Live Better. Save the Planet</a></em> tells Refinery29. "There's a concern that naked products are going to be germy or somehow not the same if they're not swaddled in billions of layers of plastic."</p><p>Luckily, there are more products than ever to get your plastic-free fix, and as Piper says, it can actually be a fun process. "Nearly any product you love has a more eco-compatible dupe that you'll equally love," Piper says.

A <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uti-treatment">UTI occurs</a> when bacteria enters the urinary tract through the urethra, causing an infection. While anyone can <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uti-bladder-infection-summer-prevention">get a UTI</a>, people with vaginas are more at risk because their urethras are shorter, so bacteria has a quicker and easier path to the bladder.</p><p>UTIs are easily treatable with medication (though if you don't treat them, they can lead to <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/untreated-uti-bladder-infection-complications">a more serious infection</a>). “UTIs are treated by antibiotic therapy,” says <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/leah-millheiser">Leah Millheiser</a>, MD, OB/GYN, Director of the Female Sexual Medicine Program at Stanford University School of Medicine. “Clinicians will choose the right one for their patients based on medication allergies and tolerability, local antibiotic resistance, and cost.”</p><p>But even though UTIs aren’t a cause for major concern, let’s face it, they’re a pain — literally, they make it <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-prevent-uti-in-women">painful to pee</a>. So let’s talk about how to prevent them in the first place. Yes, they often happen after sex (as the <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em> song “I Gave You A UTI” explains, “It's not really a comment on the quality of the sex / As much as a lot of sex has been happening / And there's just a very natural transfer of bacteria”). But it’s totally possible to <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uti-causes">get a UTI</a> without ever having sex.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ytnBRjmDXs"></iframe><p>Here are a few ways to prevent a UTI, courtesy of Dr. Millheiser:</p><p><h3>Wipe from front to back</h3></p><p>“Just like we were taught as children, always <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/switching-from-anal-to-vaginal-sex">wipe from front to back</a> after a bowel movement," says Dr. Millheiser. This reduces the risk of transferring bacteria from the anus to the urethra.</p><p><h3>Pee before and after sex</h3></p><p>This advice is right: <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pee-after-masturbating-women">peeing after sex</a> (or masturbation) helps reduce your UTI sex. <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/peeing-after-sex-awkward-moment-tips">Peeing <em>before</em> sex</a> helps too, says Dr. Millheiser. And if you <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/peeing-after-sex-uti-women">can’t pee <em>immediately</em> after sex</a>, drink some water and pee when you can.</p><p><h3>Shower before sex</h3></p><p>“Showering or bathing immediately before intercourse reduces the amount of bacteria present around the vaginal opening,” says Dr. Millheiser. It’s also a great opportunity for <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-have-shower-sex">shower sex</a> (or <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sex-in-water-guide">shower foreplay</a>, if you’re worried about falling over).</p><p><h3>Stay hydrated</h3></p><p><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dehydration">Hydration</a> has so many benefits, and helping prevent UTIs is one of them. Another reason to make sure you’re getting <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dehydration-drink-more-water-challenge-lucie-fink">eight glasses a day</a>.</p><p><h3>Pee frequently</h3></p><p>“A bladder full of urine is a great place for bacteria to grow,” says Dr. Millheiser. So <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/frequent-urination-nervous-bladder">empty your bladder</a> when you need to.</p><p><h3>Avoid irritating products</h3></p><p>Douches, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/itchy-vagina-causes">scented vaginal products</a>, spermicidal jelly, and even bubble bath or body wash can irritate the vulva and give you a UTI. Avoid them — <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-clean-vagina-and-vulva">you don’t need them, anyway</a>.</p><p><h3>Try a supplement</h3></p><p>Although it won’t replace antibiotics, research has indicated that taking a daily <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306498.php">cranberry supplement</a> slightly reduces the rate of UTI recurrences. Dr. Millheiser also suggests Pro-B, a daily <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/probiotics-food-source">probiotic</a> supplement containing two vaginal strains of lactobacilli.</p><p><h3>Balance your pH</h3></p><p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322537.php">Research</a> indicates that having a higher vaginal pH balance increases your risk of UTIs. Dr. Millheiser says she recommends the product RepHresh Vaginal Gel to her patients. Consult with your doctor to see if a pH balancing product could be right for you.</p><p><h3>Try suppressive therapy</h3></p><p>If you have recurrent UTIs — meaning you have <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/09/123633/recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-chronic-uti-treatment">more than three UTIs a year</a> — your doctor may suggest you take a daily antibiotic pill, or take an antibiotic after each time you have vaginal sex.</p><p><strong>Like what you see?

Since then the big box retailer has introduced partnerships with designers like <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229325/rodarte-universal-standard-plus-size-collection-2019">Rodarte</a>, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/201226/alexander-mcqueen-film">Alexander McQueen</a>, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/08/167426/margherita-missoni-daisy-collection">Missoni</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/225618/target-vineyard-vines-collaboration-may-2019">Vineyard Vines </a> for a taste of luxury at a fraction of the price.</p><p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of its first design partnership and the 175 that followed, Target is opening up the archives for a limited-edition collection with 300 pieces from 20 of its past designers. The limited-edition collection spans apparel, accessories, home décor and kitchen necessities. The anniversary collection will be available, while supplies last, September 14 at all Target stores and Target.com, with prices ranging from $7 to $160.</p><p>The participating designers include Michael Graves (1999-2013), Philippe Starck (2002), Stephen Sprouse (2002), Isaac Mizrahi (2003-2009), Erin Fetherston (2007), Proenza Schouler (2007), Thakoon (2008), John Derian (2008, 2010), Anna Sui (2009), Rodarte (2009), Stephen Burrows (2010), Zac Posen (2010), Harajuku Mini (2011-2012), Missoni (2011), Jason Wu (2012), Phillip Lim (2013), Altuzarra (2014), Lilly Pulitzer (2015), Marimekko (2016), and Hunter (2018).</p><p>“Target has forever changed the retail landscape by doing what once was considered impossible – offering great design at an incredible price. This anniversary celebrates our rich design history and the diverse range of partnerships we’ve offered our guests for the last 20 years,” Mark Tritton, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, Target said in a press release. “Each partnership brought something special and exciting to our guests, and with 20 years behind us, we’re only getting started. We look forward to bringing our guests more incredible, inspiring and affordable design, creating preference for Target each and every day.”</p><p>We might be just one day out of retrograde but this news is making us nostalgic for the frenzy that surrounded Target's designer collaborations in the early aughts. As soon as the lookbooks leaked, we'd use the intel to plot our in-store attack. Remember that <a href="https://www.collegefashion.net/shopping/alexander-mcqueen-for-target/">Alexander McQueen for Target zig zag dress</a> that was everywhere? What about the <a href="http://www.channinginthecity.nyc/2010/05/01/wearing-zac-posen-for-target-snap-tape-dress/">Zac Posen snap dress that everyone had to have</a>? While none of McQueen's limited-edition pieces will be in the new offering, the latter will and we're hoping for a second chance at the snap dress. But mostly, we are eager to see if designer collaborations will be relevant 20 years from now in a rapidly changing retail market.</p><p><strong>Like what you see?

Kamala Harris</a> over her <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/237134/kamala-harris-prosecutor-record-criminal-justice">criminal justice record</a> during her time serving as California’s attorney general and San Francisco’s district attorney. Gabbard came out swinging with examples of the former prosecutor’s past record on the death penalty, marijuana, and cash bail.</p><p>“There are too many examples to cite,” Gabbard said, “but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California. And she fought to keep a bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.”</p><p>Harris, who has branded herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” defended herself by saying that she “significantly” reformed the California criminal justice system as attorney general. “I’m proud of that work,” she said, then cited her <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism">reentry program</a> for former offenders. In an interview with Anderson Cooper after the debate, Harris said she expected to “take hits” on stage from others as a “top-tier candidate,” then took a dig at Gabbard — “especially when people are at 0% or 1% or whatever she might be at.” (The <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/democratic_nomination_polls/">latest 2020 presidential primary polls</a> have Harris coming in fourth place, while Gabbard has between 0% to 2% support.)</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sen.

<p>While Gabbard’s attack on Harris’ prosecutorial record was a strong knock against the California senator, it is worth dissecting how truthful the claims were in actuality.</p><p><h3><strong>“She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when...asked if she ever smoked marijuana.”</strong></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/224101/kamala-harris-marijuana-legalization">Harris’ stance on marijuana legalization</a> has changed throughout her career, and on stage Wednesday night she said that she wants to “not only decriminalize, but <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196771/where-is-weed-legal-state-marijuana-laws">legalize marijuana in the United States</a>.” She expressed opposition to legalizing weed in 2010 as the district attorney of San Francisco, saying that “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/politics/kamala-harris-record-on-marijuana-legalization/index.html">drug-selling harms communities</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/jul/31/fact-checking-democratic-debate-detroit-night-two/">According to PolitiFact</a>, the claim that Harris put “over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations” comes from an <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/kamala-harris-packed-california-prisons-for-peddling-pot/">article in <em>The Free Beacon</em></a>, a conservative news outlet, which says that “at least 1,560 people were sent to state prisons for marijuana-related offenses between 2011 and 2016,” while Harris was attorney general. However, the fact-checker clarified that as attorney general, Harris wouldn’t have been in charge of prosecuting marijuana cases, which are handled by lower-level state attorneys.</p><p>Gabbard's assertion that Harris laughed when asked whether she had ever smoked weed is likely a reference to <em>The Breakfast Club</em> interview Harris gave in February, in which she <a href="https://twitter.com/breakfastclubam/status/1094953059334176770">admitted</a> she has smoked weed before. “I did inhale,” the presidential candidate laughed as she clarified that “it was a long time ago.”</p><p><h3><strong>“She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row.”</strong></h3></p><p>The charge that Harris blocked evidence that would have freed a death-row inmate is, in fact, true. She has since changed her stance and encouraged California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-governor-orders-new-dna-tests-case-kevin-cooper-convicted-n974781">decision to order new DNA testing</a> in the 1983 murder case against Kevin Cooper, which could <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-zacchino-cooper-murder-20190130-story.html">prove whether he was wrongly convicted</a>, but Harris originally opposed the testing during her time as attorney general, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article233375207.html"><em>The Sacramento Bee</em> reported</a>. “I feel awful about this,” Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/17/opinion/sunday/kevin-cooper-california-death-row.html">told the <em>New York Times</em></a> about her regret over the decision. The testing hasn't been completed, so whether it would exonerate Cooper remains a question.</p><p><h3><strong>“She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor.”</strong></h3></p><p>Gabbard seemed to be referring to an incident in 2014, when Harris was California attorney general, when the state was accused of delaying the process of releasing non-violent offenders, who under the Supreme Court <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-1233.pdf">Brown v. Plata</a></em> ruling were eligible for parole after serving half of their sentences, due to prison overcrowding. According to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-ag-office-tried-to-keep-inmates-locked-up-for-cheap-labor">The Daily Beast</a>, lawyers from Harris’ office denied the accusation made by the class action lawsuit, but also wrote in their response that “extending 2-for-1 credits to all minimum custody inmates at this time would severely impact fire camp participation — a dangerous outcome while California is in the middle of a difficult fire season and severe drought.” (As part of a prison labor program, inmates were commissioned to fight wildfires for roughly $2 a day.)</p><p>Later that year, Harris <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adamserwer/some-lawyers-just-want-to-see-the-world-burn">said to BuzzFeed News</a> she had no knowledge of the argument made by the lawyers from her office. "I will be very candid with you, because I saw that article this morning, and I was shocked, and I'm looking into it to see if the way it was characterized in the paper is actually how it occurred in court," Harris said. "I was very troubled by what I read. I just need to find out what did we actually say in court."</p><p><h3><strong>“She fought to keep a bail system in place that impacts poor people.”</strong></h3></p><p>As San Francisco district attorney, Harris did advocate for higher bail amounts for gun-related crimes, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/fact-check-democratic-debate-night-2/index.html">according to a CNN fact-check</a>. Shortly after she was elected for the position in 2004, Harris <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/kamala-harris-made-increasing-bail-costs-a-priority-as-san-francisco-da/">spoke at an event</a> and argued that San Francisco’s low bail amounts encouraged people to come to the city "to commit crimes because it's cheaper to do it." By the next month, San Francisco's Superior Court <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Bail-costs-to-shoot-up-for-arrest-with-a-gun-3313532.php">exponentially raised cash bail</a> costs for gun-related arrests.</p><p>However, as senator, Harris has <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1097588817610096640">addressed</a> the need for bail reform across the country, and <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-paul-introduce-bill-to-encourage-states-to-reform-or-replace-unjust-costly-money-bail-system">introduced legislation</a> to encourage states to reform or replace the practice of cash bail. "Too often, poor people sit in jail because they don’t have the money to pay bail, while someone with the same offense but money in their back pocket gets out. This is a serious injustice," she tweeted in February.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rep.

And then I saw it again...and again, and again. Seemingly overnight, the multi-colored swimsuit was everywhere. I finally went on the brand’s website to check out the suits, only to be disappointed that they didn’t quite make my size. Now, a year later, the brand has more inclusive sizing, with some suits going up to size 24. Not <em>all</em> of Summersalt’s pieces are available up to a size 24 (admittedly a bummer), though 18 of their pieces from <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/swimsuits">swimsuits</a> to<a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/travel-clothes"> travelwear</a> do extend past size 14. However, the cult favorite, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summersalt-best-selling-sidestroke-bathing-suit">one-shoulder "Sidestroke" suit</a> is luckily now available up to a size 24. Wanting to see if the one piece really did live up to the hype, I recently ordered my own Summersalt suit in a size 16 and put it to the test.</p><p>Talk to anyone who’s taken the Summersalt Sidestroke suit for a test run, and the most common compliment you’ll hear is that it’s supportive. If you’re looking for thin material or a barely-there silhouette, this swimsuit probably isn’t for you. But if you’re looking for something comfortable enough to lounge in all day while still feeling like all your bits and bobs are supported, then I suggest you add one of these bad boys to your cart right now. Personally, I was worried that the suit would be too short for my long torso and frame, but was pleasantly surprised at how it fit my body. I put it on and almost immediately felt confident — an experience that’s maybe only happened twice in my life <em>ever</em> when it comes to bathing suits. The cut-out back detail was a pleasant surprise, and the impeccable fit and sturdy material was even better than all the reviews I had read.</p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0cAkFCnQOh/" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF;

The one note is that I could see how the left, strapless side of this suit may lack a tiny bit of support or structure for someone with a larger chest, but for me it worked well. I wore the suit under denim shorts for lunch and felt completely comfortable wearing the swimsuit both in the pool and on a lounge chair in the sun. Most importantly, I felt great the entire day. In fact, I got so many compliments that I’m now tempted to go back and buy the blue gradient and black versions of the suit, too.</p><p>I can’t say that the Sidestroke this is my typical, go-to style of swimsuit, but now that I’ve tried it I understand the reason why <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summersalt-best-selling-sidestroke-bathing-suit">it keeps selling out again and again</a> — something about it just looks good on everyone. And while it would be great to see Summersalt extend its <em>full</em> range of suits to 24 (and then beyond a 24), it makes me happy to think more people get the chance to look great in the swimsuit, too.</p><p><em>Olivia Muenter is a freelance writer, editor, and digital content creator who is passionate about creating things that inspire others to love themselves more.

But don’t think for one second that supplies are dwindling just because the sale is getting on — <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/238807/nordstrom-best-sellers-anniversary-sale-picks-2019">Nordy has faithfully re-stocked</a> all of the Hanky Panky thongs, Supergoop starter kits, and Vans sneakers that we shoppers could buy, and there’s still plenty of buy-now-wear-now (and wear-later) goods to be had.</p><p>This, however, is a PSA that the sale is ending this week — Sunday, August 4, to be exact. And if you’ve already done some fall shopping in the makeup and footwear categories, there’s one section of the sale that we’d encourage you to hit — the one will help you the most as you cavort your way through the remaining warm months. We’re talking about that one-and-done outfit maker: the dress. (And its cousin, the jumpsuit.) Luckily, the <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/c/anniversary-sale-womens-dresses">Anniversary Sale page</a> is full of ’em, so take a look at the one we’ve rustled up — with brands like <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/brands/madewell--11669">Madewell</a>, <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/brands/topshop--8502">Topshop</a>, and <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/brands/astr-the-label--8653">ASTR the Label</a> in the mix, you’re sure to find one or two that will stay by your side for a while.</p><p><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

But there are a handful of design teams keeping fashion ingenuity alive, including the talented sisters behind <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/10/174926/rodarte-designers-film-woodshock-unstyled-podcast">Rodarte</a>. Los Angeles natives, Kate and Laura Mulleavy, are known for their ability to inspire and thrill shoppers, with only a beautiful dress at their disposal. Thanks to their talent and creativity, Rodarte designs are featured in museums around the world, including the Costume Institute at the Met and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/216515/rodarte-fashion-museum-exhibition">the National Museum for Women in the Arts</a>. They even won one of the industry's most sought after awards, the <a href="https://cfda.com/cfda-fashion-awards/2009">CFDA Award for Womenswear Designer(s) of the Year</a>. But like most great art, Rodarte pieces aren't always the most accessible — and the design duo sought out to change that.</p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0JXIKanUgn/" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF;

It will be sold exclusively at Fred Segal Sunset from tomorrow until August 14th. "We have always been fans of Mari and love her artwork," Kate and Laura told Refinery29. "We love her paintings of animals and really wanted to highlight them."</p><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/27c/1200x900,80/2235700/image.jpg" width="1200" height="900"/><figcaption><span class="copyright">Photo: Rodarte.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/a82/1200x900,80/2235701/image.jpg" width="1200" height="900"/><figcaption><span class="copyright">Photo: Rodarte.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of the four pieces, Laura calls out the yellow sweatshirt as her favorite, telling us that she'd pair it with her favorite high-waisted jeans from AGOLDE (also an LA-based brand). As for Kate, she plans to style the white tee with one of the collection's sweatshirts tied around her neck.</p><p>To celebrate the launch, MADE, in partnership with Mastercard, will host an event like no other, featuring a Fred Segal Sunset pop-up in Los Angeles today. "It will be a fun 80s-themed party with Susanna Hoffs (of the Bangles) performing and roller skaters," the duo hinted. At the storefront, shoppers can experience the design process firsthand and take home a piece (or all four) from the capsule.</p><p><strong>Like what you see?

That’s not to say that healthcare, immigration, and climate change aren’t wildly important issues, but the fact that women (and the LGBTQ+ community, for that matter) got practically no air time was downright depressing.</p><p>Thankfully, we didn’t go an <em>entire</em> debate without mentioning gender equality. One of the few standout moments was when <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/kamala-harris-kirsten-gillibrand-democratic-debate/">Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris worked together</a> to poke holes in Joe Biden’s record on issues that primarily affect women like abortion and women’s role in the workplace.</p><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/f89/1200x900,80/2236321/image.jpg" width="1200" height="900"/><figcaption><span class="copyright">Photo: Anthony Lanzilote/Bloomberg/Getty Images.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The exchange started with CNN moderator Dana Bash asking Gillibrand about fining companies that don’t pay women equally. Gillibrand pivoted to <a href="https://twitter.com/meredithk27/status/1156749744309440513">an op-ed Biden wrote in the 1980s</a>. “I think we have to have a broader conversation about whether we value women and whether we want to make sure women have every opportunity in the workplace,” she said. “When the Senate was debating middle-class affordability for child care...[Joe Biden] voted against it, the only vote, but what he wrote in an op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, quote, ‘create the deterioration of family.’ He also said that women who were working outside the home were, quote, ‘avoiding responsibility.’”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoeBiden</a> op-ed in 1981: Expanding the childcare tax credit and allowing more women to work would subsidize "the deterioration of the family."<br><br>Those are his words. He should explain to America: How does a mom working lead to the deterioration of the family? <a href="https://t.co/RADnzTbofx">pic.twitter.com/RADnzTbofx</a></p>— Meredith Kelly (@meredithk27) <a href="https://twitter.com/meredithk27/status/1156749744309440513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Biden responded by listing his involvement in legislation like the Violence Against Women Act and Lilly Ledbetter equal pay legislation, ending with the quip, “I don’t know what’s happened except that you’re now running for president.” Of course, the messy debate format also meant that we didn’t get to expand on that op-ed, which was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/01/747122903/fact-check-gillibrand-attacks-biden-on-1981-deterioration-of-family-op-ed">a little more complex</a> (and, quite frankly, confusing) than either candidate had time to unpack. It was about Biden’s opposition to high-earning couples taking advantage of a child-care tax credit made for lower-income families — but Biden vaguely argued that wealthy couples would use the tax credit to “forsake responsibility” for their own children and instead use it to chase their own selfish material desires.</p><p>After the initial skirmish between Gillibrand and Biden, Harris interjected — and Bash gave her the floor — to question the former vice president’s record on the <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/06/234837/joe-biden-hyde-amendment-repeal-reverse-position">Hyde Amendment</a>, which prohibits federal funds from being used for abortions. “Listen, I mean talk about now running for president, you change your position on the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare, including women who were the victims of rape and incest,” she said.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.r29static.com//bin/entry/41e/1200x900,80/2236319/image.jpg" width="1200" height="900"/><figcaption><span class="copyright">Photo: Matt Baron/Shutterstock.</span></figcaption></figure><p>And just as quickly as the opportunity to talk about women’s rights appeared, it evaporated in an instant, with the conversation turning to unions and then foreign policy in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Largely because of the format, Gillibrand and Harris' fleeting mentions of women’s inequality could’ve gone a lot further. Gillibrand didn't really answer the initial question about fining companies who don’t promote equal pay for employees, an issue that seems like it should be in her repertoire. While she's made many <a href="https://time.com/5562209/equal-pay-day-2020-candidates/">statements on equal pay</a> and co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, her campaign has yet to put out an equal pay plan. And despite the <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/06/234750/elizabeth-warren-hyde-amendment-abortion-access-town-hall">Hyde Amendment</a> being about abortion funding, no candidate on the stage actually said the word "abortion."</p><p>Of course, we also have to look at the reason the exchange even came up: It only happened because the candidates were asked the single women-centric question of the night — about equal pay — by the only female moderator. This speaks to the importance of <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/234148/democratic-presidential-debate-info-2020-dnc-female-moderator">diversifying the moderator field</a>, which the Democratic National Committee (DNC) recently vowed to do.</p><p>Imperfections aside, I’d like to see <em>more</em> moments where female candidates come together — especially to further discussions around undercovered issues that impact women every day.</p><p>During previous debates, female candidates have by and large focused their energies on individually taking on male opponents. But imagine what they could do and what we’d be talking about as a nation if they were able to combine those efforts and amplify their power. Even if Gillibrand and Harris weren't necessarily trying to make the exchange into a larger feminist moment, the optics were still the same: Biden continued to fumble on women’s rights while two female candidates brought up several salient points on the subject in a debate that was sorely lacking it.</p><p>The strategy was a needed boost for Gillibrand: Her communications director Emmy Bengtson <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmyA2/status/1156762046941278208">reported</a> that during the debate, she received more than twice as many donations as she did during the first debate, and 75% of these donors were new. In contrast, Joe Biden’s debate performance has been deemed generally lackluster, with the biggest day-after talking point being that he misspoke in his closing statement and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/go-to-joe-30330-bidens-closing-statement-leaves-people-scratching-their-heads/">told people to “go to” his text line “Joe 30330”</a> instead of his campaign website.</p><p>This is not to say that female politicians should never criticize each other and should only go after male candidates forever. (In fact, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard got a lot of attention last night by going after Harris' prosecutorial record.) But at this point in the race, with the first primary still six months away and 10 more presidential primary debates on the calendar through April 2020, it makes sense for women to team up and have the uncomfortable conversations that many of the male politicians have gotten to avoid for decades.</p><p>It’d be an understatement to say last night’s debate left much to be desired. The setup was chaotic, the answers were confusing, and the entire affair lacked energy. But Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand’s brief partnership onstage showed what can happen if women stick together. On a night that’ll go down as wildly unmemorable, it was one of the few highlights that gave me hope for what’s to come. What if, instead of fighting, the focus was on coming together and highlighting issues that many of these men aren’t — and making marginalized groups feel seen?</p><p>Why not let the men take each other down, all while helping ourselves rise?</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NationalGirlfriendsDay?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NationalGirlfriendsDay</a>!

Yes, we’re talking about <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/when-does-morning-sickness-start">morning sickness</a>. The term “morning sickness” is something of a misnomer, because the need to puke can hit <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/01/101305/strange-pregnancy-health-effects">pregnant people</a> at any time of day. According to the <a href="https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Morning-Sickness-Nausea-and-Vomiting-of-Pregnancy">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, generally, nausea and vomiting will begin before the nine-week mark. For some people, nausea is the first sign that they're pregnant. Generally, morning sickness will be over by the <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/185295/second-pregnancy-expectations">second trimester</a>, though it’s not unusual for it to continue for longer.</p><p><a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/219668/what-does-morning-sickness-feel-like">Morning sickness</a> may be mild (defined as nausea lasting for a short time each day and infrequent vomiting) or severe (nausea lasting for several hours each day and vomiting more than twice a day). Along with nausea, people may develop an intolerance to certain foods, drinks and smells (coffee is a common culprit). People who are carrying multiples, have a history of motion sickness or migraines, or have a parent or sibling who experienced severe morning sickness are more at risk.</p><p>Nausea and vomiting is usually not harmful to the fetus, and some research indicates that more severe morning sickness may be linked to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2553283">lower risk of miscarriage</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/health/19real.html">carrying a female fetus</a>. But of course, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/06/156785/first-trimester-pregnancy-blues-loneliness">morning sickness</a> is not pleasant for you! If you’re concerned by how much you’re vomiting, check in with your doctor. If you’re experiencing pain, a fever, a headache, or a swollen thyroid gland, another medical condition may be contributing to your nausea.</p><p>So, what can you do about <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/11/97881/morning-sickness-myths-realities">morning sickness</a>? While time and the progression of your pregnancy is the main factor, you can alleviate symptoms by taking a multivitamin; eating dry toast or crackers before you get out of bed; drinking fluids; eating smaller, more frequent meals; eating <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pregnancy-cravings-morning-sickness">bland, low-fat foods</a> such as toast, rice, and bananas; and sipping ginger ale or ginger tea made with real ginger. Your doctor might also recommend you take Vitamin B6 or doxylamine, or prescribe medication to prevent vomiting.</p><p>Very severe morning sickness is called <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2012/12/40379/hyperemesis-gravidarum">hyperemesis gravidarum</a>. This condition affects up to 3% of pregnancies — it’s gained a lot of attention in recent years, thanks to <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/10/176574/kate-middleton-pregnant-body-shame">Kate Middleton</a> and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/225175/amy-schumer-cancels-tour-pregnancy-hyperemesis">Amy Schumer</a> going public with their experiences. Hyperemesis gravidarum is diagnosed when the pregnant person has lost 5% of their pre-pregnancy weight and is experiencing symptoms of dehydration. Treatment and sometimes a stay in the hospital is needed. While hyperemesis gravidarum may fade after the first trimester, in many cases, it persists throughout the pregnancy.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-concerns/vomiting-during-pregnancy/">American Pregnancy Association</a>, up to 85% of pregnant people experience some form of morning sickness. But though it’s normal, it’s definitely unpleasant, so feel free to complain all you want. As <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/217110/amy-schumer-hospitalized-hyperemesis-gravidarum-pregnancy">Amy Schumer put it</a>, “Very lucky to be pregnant but this is some bullsh**!"</p><p><strong>Like what you see?

We want to know who YOUR Force for Change is.... Each month, we change the accounts we follow to highlight various causes, people or organisations doing amazing things for their communities and the world at large. Over the next few days please add your suggestions into the comments section: someone you look up to, the organisation doing amazing work that we should all be following, an account that inspires you to be and do better (or that simply makes you feel good), or the handle that brims with optimism for a brighter tomorrow. We will choose 15 accounts and follow them next Monday, as we spend the month of August acknowledging the Forces for Change in all of our lives.</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> The Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> (@sussexroyal) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2019-07-31T23:00:08+00:00">Jul 31, 2019 at 4:00pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script><p>This announcement comes just as the September issue of British <em>Vogue,</em> for which Markle served as <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/07/239138/meghan-markle-british-vogue-september-2019">the guest editor</a>, is about to hit newsstands.

For the past few months, the Duchess and I have been working together on this shared passion project: to dedicate British Vogue’s biggest issue of the year to all the remarkable women who are redefining our world for the better. We have called it – and them – our #ForcesForChange. The story begins with this cover, starring 15 changemakers, all titans in their respective fields, who have been personally selected by the Duchess and myself for the powerful and positive differences they are making in our world. The 16th slot will appear as a mirror on the printed cover, and was included at the special request of the Duchess to show that you – that all of us, in fact – are part of this moment too. It’s been a real labour of love and I feel very humbled today to be able to finally unveil it to the world. Read about how the Duchess became the first guest editor of the September issue in the magazine’s 103-year history at Vogue.co.uk now, and discover the full cover story in the new issue, on newsstands Friday 2 August.

No matter how the increased moisture levels mess with your hair — creating a fuzzy halo around your <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/air-dry-hair-by-texture">air-dried</a> curls or instantly unpinning the flyaways you spent twelve minutes <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anti-frizz-humidity-spray">smoothing</a> — it's a struggle that often ends with a heavy sigh and a <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sephora">Sephora</a> search for "<a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/frizzy-hair">anti-frizz</a> treatment."</p><p>If you're prone to the perennial fight against the muggy air, the quickest fix may just be to switch up your <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shampoo">shampoo</a>. Celebrity stylist Justine Marjan tells us that your in-shower routine can actually make a big impact in how your hair responds — or doesn't respond — to the dew point. "You want to find a shampoo that pushes moisture into the hair," she says. "When your hair is well-hydrated, it's <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chlorine-removal-shampoo">soft, silky, and more manageable</a> when the moisture in the air increases."</p><p>With that three-pronged goal in mind — softness, smoothness, and manageability — we asked five celebrity hairstylists to share their arsenal of humidity-blocking shampoos. Ahead, their favorite bottles, and a foolproof guide to making <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-anti-frizz-serum">stubborn frizz</a> a non-issue this summer.</p><p><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

We acknowledge that the OP’s living expenses are subsidized by her partner’s income, while her day-to-day expenses are largely her own.</em></p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Social Worker<br/><strong>Industry:</strong> Mental Health<br/><strong>Age:</strong> 30<br/><strong>Location:</strong> San Jose, CA<br/><strong>Salary:</strong> $52,827 (My partner's income is $605,000 and he pays for a lot, but we don't have a joint account right now. He is a lead designer working in tech.)<br/><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $1,572 (It can be $300-$500 more if I remember to calculate my mileage, because I drive a lot for work and they reimburse that cost.)<br/><strong>Gender Identity:</strong> Woman</p><p><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br/><strong>Mortgage:</strong> $400 (Due to my boyfriend making a lot more than me, we came up with this amount that we felt was fair. It's important for me to contribute something financially to our household expenses. Household expenses include the house cleaner, parking-spot rental, our utilities, and a fraction of the mortgage.)<br/><strong>Student Loans:</strong> $170 (I have $5,000 left.) <br/><strong>403(b):</strong> My agency matches 4%. I have around $2,000 built up. <br/><strong>Car Insurance:</strong> $100<br/><strong>Cell Phone:</strong> $50 (I am on a very old family plan with my mom and my brother. I Venmo her this amount monthly.)<br/><strong>Health Insurance:</strong> $0 (My work pays for my health insurance.)<br/><strong>Amazon Prime:</strong> $14.16<br/><strong>Hulu:</strong> $5.99<br/><strong><em>New York Times</em> Subscription:</strong> $4<br/><strong>Apple Music</strong>: $0 (My brother has a family plan and has me and my mom on it.)</p><p><h3>Day One</h3></p><p>8:30 a.m. — My alarm wakes me up way too early on a Sunday morning, but I remember my boyfriend, K., and I are picking up my mom and her dog to meet my brother in San Francisco. I browse through Instagram and the RealReal quietly as K. sleeps a little more. Even the dog is still asleep! Finally, I roll over and start fluttering my eyelashes on K.'s cheeks to wake him up. He acts fake grumpy but pulls me in to cuddle.</p><p>9:30 a.m. — We spend some time talking about the dreams each of us had (mine are always stressful, realistic, and dramatic, and K.'s are always similar to an action-movie plot), and somehow we stumble into a very random relationship health check-in. K. is 12 years older than me, and thankfully, he is very indulgent with my emotional side. I get into the shower while K. takes out the dog and feeds the cat. I do my easy skin-care/makeup routine of Low PH Good Morning CosRX cleanser, Dr. Jart+ Water Drop moisturizer, Erborian BB Ginseng cream, brush out my eyelashes, and do my eyebrows with my favorite drugstore L'Oréal compact. I used to have a ten-step skin-care routine (literally) but found that after a while, it made my sensitive, acne-prone skin more irritable in the long run. Now I stick to two different cleansers, an exfoliant, and moisturizer.</p><p>10:45 a.m. — Say goodbye to the dog and meet K. downstairs in the parking garage. Since my mom will be bringing our family dog and his crate, I don't think K.'s sports car will be a comfortable fit. Before we drive to my mom's, I stop by the gas station to fill up. I love my Prius, even though it makes me look like an Uber driver — a tank of gas lasts so long! <strong>$34.50</strong></p><p>12:45 p.m. — We pick up my mom and then meet my brother at the Ferry Marketplace. My brother is two years younger than me, and we are best friends. It's harder to see each other since he moved to Berkeley, so I am always super excited to see him. K. wants a BBQ pork bun, and my mom and I want empanadas. K. sheepishly asks me if I can pick one up for him, too. We order two of the mushroom empanadas for K. and my mom and the beef empanada for me, as it is the only one with no dairy in it (I'm lactose intolerant). They are pricey but worth it. I treat! <strong>$27.05</strong></p><p>2 p.m. — We decide to eat at Gott's Roadside Burgers, because K. has never tried it and it has a relaxed outdoor patio, which works with the little puff. My mom and brother order a cheeseburger, K. orders a hotdog, and I order a hamburger and fries to share. I treat. <strong>$75.29</strong></p><p>7 p.m. — We drop my mom at home and then stop at Whole Foods. I pick up cherry tomatoes, raspberries, blackberries, and a chocolate cheesecake. I also pick up a bundle of bright red gladiolas, since my mom inspired me as she had these red gladiolas in her house and they looked STUNNING. <strong>$23.02</strong></p><p>7:30 p.m. — K. and I sit and talk a little bit about the afternoon and his business trip tomorrow. Thankfully, it's only 24 hours! We have our own hobbies, interests, and friends, but it's really hard for us to be apart from each other. He helps me do the dishes, and we do our own separate decompression activities for the night. I head to bed at around 11 p.m.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $159.86</strong></p><p><h3>Day Two</h3></p><p>7:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off, and I am definitely not ready to wake up yet. I quite literally roll out of bed and stumble into the bathroom. I take a quick shower and get dressed. I kiss K. goodbye and then head to work.</p><p>11 a.m. — I have a busy morning catching up with emails and voicemails and checking in with my clients. K. sends me a sweet text, and we text for a little. We're planning on taking a trip to Italy and Corsica in September, but I just realized my yoga teacher training starts the first weekend of September. We discuss tweaking the dates. We're also planning on doing a bathroom and kitchen renovation while we're traveling, so it's another thing to coordinate. I'm bad at coordinating things like this (my job makes me coordinate enough, so any more than that and my brain explodes), so K. will arrange dates and times.</p><p>12:45 p.m. — I haven't eaten all day, and I know I should eat something soon. I decide to drive down the street to Japantown and pick up some mini sandwiches from the Japanese market. I also buy some Noir Black Cocoa Sticks (they taste like Oreos!) and a bottle of water, which I feel so guilty about. That plastic waste, ugh. <strong>$8.63</strong></p><p>4:40 p.m. — Finally home! The dog is twirling around me, and I am equally excited to see him. I boil some Trader Joe's gyoza and make a quick dipping sauce of sesame oil, rice-wine vinegar, and low-sodium soy sauce. It's mediocre, but it's something. I start watching <em>Euphoria</em> and text my brother about how this is literally every parent's worst nightmare, rolled into a show.</p><p>8 p.m. — K. texts to let me know he set up a shared calendar for us to schedule our social events, as there have been many times where we've looked at each other like, “Oh shit,” when we forget one of us made plans for us. Our weekend already looks booked, and I make sure to carve out some time on Saturday for some quiet "me" time. K. is a lot more social than me, but I've become better at balancing as I've gotten older.</p><p>9:30 p.m. — I watch the second episode of <em>Big Little Lies</em> (Zoe is my biggest crush, and I am also LIVING for Renata) before falling asleep at 10:45.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $8.63</strong></p><p><h3>Day Three</h3></p><p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up way later than I should have.  I scramble out of bed, take a shower, usual skin-care and makeup routine. I light some sage, make the bed, take the dog out, and feed the cat.</p><p>10:45 a.m. — After a few stressful client appointments, I decide I need an iced coffee from Starbucks, ASAP. I get one with soy and one pump of sugar-free vanilla. I also get a plain toasted bagel because I should eat something. <strong>$5.40</strong></p><p>2:30 p.m. — I decide to finish my day working at home. Our agency is small, and when it's loud, it's nearly impossible to get anything done. I get home, take the dog out, and then settle at the kitchen table to write some more treatment plans and progress notes. I make a lunch plate of salami, Milton's whole-wheat crackers, a big handful of cherry tomatoes, and blackberries. The house is so quiet! I love it.</p><p>4:45 p.m. — Break time. I need to run two errands — one of which is Sephora, since I ran out of my Hourglass No.28 primer ($21). On my way home, I stop by Whole Foods. I make a salad for dinner from the salad bar and pick up a half pound of fresh lychee, two yellow mangoes, two ears of corn, a clamshell of blackberries, and a bottle of Tejava ($23.76). <strong>$44.76</strong></p><p>7:30 p.m. — K. texts me to tell me he's stressed about making his flight, so I offer to Doordash him dinner, to be waiting for him when he gets home. I have some credit, so with tax and tip it only comes out to $10. <strong>$10</strong></p><p>10:15 p.m. — Once K. gets home and I give him some love, I take a shower (I take a lot of showers), moisturize, brush my teeth, and do my skin-care routine. Light sage and palo santo. I remember to make a dinner reservation for tomorrow, as my best friend and I want to catch up over dinner. We get into bed, have sex, and pillow talk a little bit until we both pass out mid-conversation.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $60.16</strong></p><p><h3>Day Four</h3></p><p>7:30 a.m. — I REALLY do not want to get out of bed. I roll over and stretch and stare at K. while he's sleeping. I know that is creepy, but I just really love him a lot and think he's so damn handsome. I finally get out of bed, take a shower (except I skip the hair wash), moisturize, skin-care and usual makeup routine. Kiss and hug K. goodbye as I head into work.</p><p>10:30 a.m. — I'm drinking Folger's coffee and eating a slice of stale baguette from my coworker as I do progress notes.</p><p>1:30 p.m. — I need to meet with a client in the field, which means no time for an actual lunch, so I grab a stupid expensive smoothie from SunLife Organics to hold me over. <strong>$10.02</strong></p><p>4:45 p.m. — I start packing up my things so I can head home. I am feeling a little tired and overwhelmed by the amount of never-ending paperwork. I usually do a 90-minute yoga class at a local community studio on Wednesday evenings, but I won't be able to tonight since I'm going to dinner with my best friend, M., at a hookah bar.</p><p>7:05 p.m. — We picked the WORST possible day to go to this hookah bar/restaurant, as there is a damn jazz festival and there is literally no parking. I circle around 12 times and get a text from my best friend saying she's parked and is inside the patio part of the restaurant. I end up getting stressed out and parking at the train station directly across the street. I read a sign that says parking is free after 6, but for some reason I don't trust that and pay the parking fee anyway. <strong>$5.50</strong></p><p>7:25 p.m. — We're finally reunited! Even though a year and a couple months have passed, we slip right into our normal banter and conversation. It's like no time has passed at all. I order a glass of Pinot Noir, and M. orders a chilled vodka with lemon. When our drinks arrive, I take a sip of my wine and instantly know it's gone bad. I have M. taste it to confirm. I get a Stella instead.</p><p>10:50 p.m. — Four vodkas for M., half of that one Stella for me, and two hookahs later, I tell M. that these fumes are getting to me and I feel a bad headache coming on. I'm also tired as I rarely stay up this late during the weekdays. We request the check, and I insist on treating her, since it was her birthday a couple days prior. She refuses to let me get the bill, as she drank a lot more than me. We fight about it like POC often do (have you seen two POC fight over a check? It gets crazy), but she finally wins. I thank her, and I make a mental note to plan a dinner for us soon. We hug and kiss, and I tell her I was so happy to see her. She catches a ride, and I walk back to my car.</p><p>11:20 p.m. — I text M. to make sure she got home safely and get into bed after doing my skin-care routine. K. gets ready for bed and joins me. We end up talking for 30 minutes and fall asleep way later than normal.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $15.52</strong></p><p><h3>Day Five</h3></p><p>7:20 a.m. — I wake up cranky. I groan as I get out of bed and head into the shower. I know it seems like I take a lot of showers, and it's because I do — I just love them! I hang with K. for a bit and then head out.</p><p>8:30 a.m. — I drink Folger's coffee before my team meeting. I have no voicemails and no emails, which should be exciting but leaves me feeling unsettled. It's very unusual for a social worker to have zero emails and zero voicemails. I take it as a bad omen that shit may hit the fan in a few days.</p><p>11:30 a.m. — After working at my computer for a couple hours, I decide that I need to do a snack run. I drive to Whole Foods and pick up their brown-butter chocolate-chip cookies, two-bite brownies, Boom Chicka Pop Kettle Corn, cotton-candy grapes, and a small box of brown rice and garlic broccoli from the hot bar for lunch. I get back in the office and coordinate dates for K. to go visit his family for his grandfather's funeral. He asks me how I feel about attending with him, and we ultimately decide that I'll stay back this time and take care of the animals. It's a decision that feels right for the both of us. <strong>$30.28</strong></p><p>4 p.m. —I leave work early to head to the dentist. It is my first time with this new dentist, and I'm so glad I like him so much. Everything was painless and no cavities! I've never had a cavity, and I'm still always nervous that day will happen. I stop by my mom's to say goodbye to her, since she's going on a trip for the weekend. I'm also watching her dog, so she gives me very strict instructions, as she thinks I'm going to just throw endless treats at the puff and have a party.</p><p>6:30 p.m. — Finally get home and walk into a sparkling clean kitchen, thanks to K. Dishes are done, dish rack is cleared, and so is the dishwasher. He even cleaned the clumps of cat hair and my hair out of the Roomba, since we're giving it to my best friend at work. I make a quick pasta dish of rigatoni, olive oil, red chili flakes, cherry tomatoes, and peas.</p><p>8 p.m. — I settle in to do some work while K. plays some computer game with a couple of his coworkers. Men grow into teenagers when they play video games — it's fascinating. I end up watching the Theranos/Elizabeth Holmes documentary on HBO, because I find her incredibly interesting.</p><p>9:55 p.m. — I start getting ready for bed by taking a shower, doing my skin-care and body moisturizing routine with Aesop Breathless oil, Nécessaire lotion, and Aquaphor for my tattoos. I get into bed and turn on <em>Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce</em> on Netflix to zone out. I take three melatonin, and we fall asleep linking pinkies.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $30.28</strong></p><p><h3>Day Six</h3></p><p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up and feel surprisingly refreshed. Everyone wakes up, and we all do our normal morning routines. I want to get into the office early because I have a few client appointments today. I remember I'm staying the nights at my mom's house to dog-sit, so I pack a bag with my makeup, skin care, and some workout clothes for Saturday.</p><p>8:15 a.m. — I grab a cup of coffee from the community kitchen and settle at my desk. I do the usual drill of phone calls to clients (sometimes we do phone appointments), treatment plans, and progress notes. My 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. client appointments call me to cancel. It sucks, but I appreciate the notice from both clients! That clears up my day a little bit more.</p><p>10 a.m. — K. texts that he made a reservation for a date tonight. We go out once or twice a week for dates, and we alternate planning them. We get a little competitive with each other on who can plan the best date nights. I won for the month of June, but he's still trying!</p><p>4:45 p.m. — I finish an appointment with my client at Starbucks. It is our usual meeting place, and we discuss some things that we are working on together. I buy myself an iced coffee and buy her one, too. I am so ready for the week to be over and happily drive over to my mom's house. The little puff is so excited to see me, and I feed him, let him out, and then spend some time snuggling with him on the floor. K. is picking me up at 7, so I decide to take a shower and get all "Who is she?" for date night. During the week, I hardly ever do my makeup or get dressed up, so it's nice to do my thing and feel sexy during the weekends. <strong>$10.03</strong></p><p>6:30 p.m. — Makeup is done and hair is done. I feel like K. and I just started dating all over again, with him picking me up for a date and me trying to figure out what to wear. I change two or three times and feel butterflies in my stomach! I finally settle on a simple black thin-strapped dress and Gucci slip-on loafers.</p><p>7:15 p.m. — K. knocks on my mom's door, and I feel like I'm seeing him for the first time. We go to dinner, and I order a glass of wine and K. orders a margarita. We split a Caesar salad and croquettes, and I order the arrabbiata pasta and K. gets their Argentine steak. Everything is really delicious. I really value our dinner conversations, because it's a time for us to really connect, flirt a lot, and talk about what we want to work toward together. K. and I are at the point where we know we want to get married, but are still figuring out how we each feel about having kids. Tonight, we're able to have a really honest conversation about us potentially having kids (or not), without it being too emotionally charged. It feels so good.</p><p>10 p.m. — After we share tiramisu, K. picks up the check ($195) and he drives me to my mom's house. I ask him if he would like to come in, and he says only for a glass of water. We know what that means. We let the puff out, and I give him a glass of water to be cheeky. One thing leads to another, and we have sex. After some brief post-sex cuddle time, I kick him out and tell him that MAYBE I'll text him tomorrow (he had to get home to our dog, who was barking like crazy. Thanks for the alerts, Furbo).</p><p>11:45 p.m. — Staying at my mom's is fun because she has cable and I can binge watch all the <em>90 Day Fiancé</em> I want with ZERO interruptions. Even my mom's dog loves it. I let him out one more time and give him a little late-night snack. I text K. good night and turn on an ASMR playlist as I pass out.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $10.03</strong></p><p><h3>Day Seven</h3></p><p>8:45 a.m. — The puff wakes me up way too early for a Saturday. I let him out and feed him his breakfast. I am going to my friend's workout class in an hour, so I hurry and get ready by fixing my hair, brushing my teeth, and getting dressed in yoga leggings and my friend's workout company's shirt to show support.</p><p>10 a.m. — My friend co-owns an amazing, empowering fitness company that puts on extremely fun but ass-destroying workouts. My legs are shaking, and I feel like I'm going to throw up mid-workout. I flip off my friend numerous times as she films us for her company's IG. Afterward, they open bottles of Champagne for mimosas (I skip out), and I hang out for a little bit to chat and take Polaroids with my friends. I give everyone sweaty hugs goodbye, because I am meeting K. at our friend's house for brunch so we can meet his new girlfriend.</p><p>11:45 a.m. — I walk into our friend's home that smells like French toast and bacon. Our friend D. is an amazing cook, and he spoils us by making French-style scrambled eggs, cinnamon French toast with fresh whipped cream and berries, and bacon. K. brought over stuff for grapefruit and orange juice mimosas. We spend brunch getting to know his new girlfriend and catching up on what we've all been up to. The girlfriend seems nice. Our friend is such a good guy that we only want the best for him.</p><p>1:15 p.m. — A week ago, my mom booked me a nail appointment at our mutual nail salon. My appointment is in 15 minutes, so I thank D. for brunch and give sweaty hugs to everyone. K. and I walk out, and he heads home while I head to my appointment.</p><p>3 p.m. — My mom booked me a pedicure and a gel manicure! I haven't had a pedicure in forever, so it was really nice to relax. I usually go for neutral colors, but I get bright red with two little white dots. I go to pay, but she tells me that my mom paid for it last week, and she included tip. I am so shocked and grateful for my mom! I give her an additional $25 tip anyway, because she did a great job. I send a text to my mom as I leave the salon, thanking her profusely. She sends me a bunch of heart emojis in response. <strong>$25</strong></p><p>5:00 p.m. — I start getting ready for dinner by doing my makeup. My hair is air-dried, so it's wavy and messy, just the way I like it. I try on three different outfits again, because hello, butterflies.</p><p>6 p.m. — K. picks me up, and when I get in the car, he tells me to check the side pocket of the door. He wrote me a little note, and I smile. K. is not the most romantic man, but he really tries and I really appreciate the small gestures he makes.</p><p>7 p.m. — The food is seriously amazing. I order a glass of wine, and K. orders a sour beer. We share beet tartare, octo-pie flatbread, artichoke hearts, focaccia bread, grilled octopus, and their massive roasted chicken dish that's meant for two. Each dish is really unique but really, really good. I'm pleasantly surprised! K. and I spend the majority of dinner bantering with each other and laughing. Until, <em>dun dun dun</em>, we talk about our timeline for marriage. We decide we are both about 98% there, but we both agree there are issues we still want to work on before we decide to get engaged. Whew.</p><p>9:45 p.m. — We share a rosette tart for dessert, and K. picks up the check ($250). I thank him for dinner, and we walk back to the car.</p><p>11 p.m. — K. drops me off at my mom's house. I invite him in for some "more water," and he spends some time with me before he has to head home, since the dog is barking like crazy. I let the puff out, take a shower, and crawl into bed to watch more <em>90 Day Fiancé</em>. It's weird falling asleep without K., but I fall asleep feeling so content and happy about this week.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $25</strong></p><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/df7/1200x900/2235378/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/></figure><p><em>Money Diaries are meant to reflect individual women's experiences and do not necessarily reflect Refinery29's point of view.

But after <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chunky-ugly-sneakers-trend">chunky sneakers</a> and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fanny-pack-belt-bag">fanny packs</a> experienced a renaissance, we weren't at all surprised to see yet another <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dad-style-fashion-trends">dad-inspired trend</a> make its way into the spotlight — and we're kind of into it. This summer, we’re making a case for — wait for it — Hawaiian shirts. And even Malia Obama is loving the trend: she was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7307705/Malia-Obama-British-boyfriend-Rory-Farquharson-seen-enjoying-brunch-Ojai-resort.html">spotted wearing a blue version</a> at brunch with her rumored boyfriend Rory Farquharson and his family.

This trend has gotten a major overhaul, and we’re falling for it — hard. Added details like piped seams and belted waists make all the difference. Plus, you can play around with buttons for added interest. Just fasten a few up top while leaving the bottom open for a breezy transition out of the dad-zone.</p><p>Ahead, we've rounded up 20 Hawaiian shirts that'll have you feeling like you're on vacation — even when you're not.</p><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/shop/52b/x,80/1981296/image.jpg" width="920" height="1380"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/shop/c12/x,80/1981338/image.jpg" width="336" height="596"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s3.r29static.com//bin/shop/68d/x,80/1981415/image.jpg" width="600" height="900"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/shop/4a6/x,80/1981441/image.jpg" width="1025" height="1435"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/shop/250/x,80/1981302/image.jpg" width="880" height="1130"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s3.r29static.com//bin/entry/6af/x,80/1981450/image.jpg" width="747" height="1024"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/45c/x/1981537/image.png" width="1600" height="2133"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/f38/x/1981351/image.png" width="1920" height="2623"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/a33/x/1981330/image.png" width="1044" height="1392"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s3.r29static.com//bin/shop/ddf/x,80/1981430/image.jpg" width="880" height="1130"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s3.r29static.com//bin/entry/5f0/x/1981434/image.png" width="1000" height="1334"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/528/x,80/1981428/image.jpg" width="1500" height="2098"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/shop/d7e/x,80/1981339/image.jpg" width="336" height="596"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/e38/x/1981337/image.png" width="1044" height="1392"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/885/x,80/1981411/image.jpg" width="513" height="655"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/b00/x/1981439/image.png" width="2848" height="4288"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/shop/180/x,80/1981435/image.jpg" width="1024" height="1313"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/shop/265/x,80/1981413/image.jpg" width="528" height="702"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/70f/x/1981323/image.png" width="1920" height="2379"/></figure><figure><img src="https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/fa3/x/1981409/image.png" width="1200" height="1800"/></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

Her case gained national attention after the Tennessee Supreme Court <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/07/us/cyntoia-brown-prison-release/index.html">ruled</a> last December that she would <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/12/218964/cynyoita-brown-murder-case-lawsuit-denied">have to serve 51 years in prison</a> before being eligible for parole.</p><p>As part of the terms of her commuted sentence, Brown will have to report to a parole officer regularly for the next decade. She is also required to stay employed, participate in counseling, and perform community service with at-risk youth.</p><p>The prosecution of minors has changed significantly in Tennessee and across the U.S. since Brown’s first trial in 2006. Back then, she was charged as an adult in the 2004 murder of real estate agent Johnny Allen. Allen purchased her for $150 in exchange for sex. At the time, Brown was only 16 and living with a 24-year-old pimp known as "Cut Throat." She has said her relationship with Cut Throat was sexually, physically, and emotionally abusive, and eventually, he forced her into prostitution.</p><p>Brown has since then said she shot Allen in self-defense. She was not allowed to testify at her original trial, which meant that evidence of her traumatic childhood history, such as her time under the care of the state Department of Children's Services, and her severe neurodevelopmental disorder wasn't presented. The then-teenager was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences.</p><p>Over her 15 years in prison, Brown received her associate's degree and has mentored other female inmates. Now, she'll have a second chance at life.</p><p>"With God's help, I am committed to live the rest of my life helping others, especially young people," <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cyntoia-brown-clemency-news-dance-reaction">Brown said in a statement</a> shortly after her sentence was commuted. "My hope is to help other young girls avoid ending up where I have been."</p><p><strong>Like what you see?

Some people like a short and rounded shape, others prefer a <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/almond-nails-designs">skinny almond</a>, some ask for their tips square. There's no wrong answer — but now, there's a new shape manicurists are bringing to the table, and it has a name that would make any beauty lover want to give it a try. Enter: the lipstick nail.</p><p>As the name would suggest, a lipstick-shaped nail is filed at an asymmetrical angle, giving it a diagonal slant reminiscent of a fresh, never-been-used lip-color bullet. The shape was originally coined by celebrity and editorial nail artist Park Eunkyung of Unistella Nails, who has since been promoting the creative style on her Instagram.</p><p>Here, she tells us the funny inspiration behind her lipstick-shaped nails, plus why she loves them and expects the trend to take off this fall. Scroll through to get acquainted.</p><figure><figcaption><p>"I was working on a shoot for a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/By9dwYxFXBi/">YSL sunglasses campaign</a> and I was really drawn to the cat-eye frames, and thought it would be interesting to try and shape my nails like cat-eye sunglasses," Eunkyung tells us of her OG fashion inspiration. "It turned out more like a lipstick shape — but I actually loved the detail it gave to my manicure."</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>If you're worried about the issue of comfort, Eunkyung says it's one of the reasons why she loves the lipstick shape. "I've recently been loving the look of long nails, but they've never felt comfortable to me," she explains. "Since I've tried the lipstick shape, I can't stop wearing it because it has a unique look that I like, but also because it's surprisingly comfortable — like a short nail and long nail in one."</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>Though the trend is on the rise thanks to Eunkyung's influence, she understands the initial hesitation to give the out-of-the-box shape a try. "I haven't seen lipstick-shaped nails on too many other people yet," she says. "I think the look is so pretty and unique, but I was definitely a bit afraid to try it at first. If other people feel the same, I think they'll also love it once they see how it looks and feels on their nails."</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>Eunkyung often pairs her lipstick-shaped nails with bright pops of color and art, but she says a muted nude or <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/light-pink-nail-polish">light-pink polish</a> lets the angular design have its moment.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>Other artists who've tried the lipstick shape have added extra pizazz with silver foils.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>...or <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glitter-nail-polish">glitter</a> over a royal-purple base tone.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>We've also seen softer approaches to the dramatic lipstick shape. Here, the angling is gentle, and only on two nails.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><p>Again, blink and you'll miss it, but if you look closely, you can tell that the tips of both the left ring finger and middle finger show a slight lipstick slant. <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/06/235833/orange-nail-polish">The orange color</a> is perfectly on-trend, too.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/69c/x/2146234/image.png" width="1068" height="1600"/><figcaption><p>Like this post?
