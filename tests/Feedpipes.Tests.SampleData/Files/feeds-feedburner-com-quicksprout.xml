								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FAQ pages represent a crucial component of the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/conversion-funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer conversion funnel</a>. Anyone who lands on this page has already identified the need for whatever you’re selling and is now entering the consideration phase of the purchase process.</p>
<p>Your FAQ page can provide them with the information required to finalize their buying decision.</p>
<p>However, I see so many websites that overlook the importance of this landing page. I read lots of FAQ pages that sound more like an afterthought, as opposed to a page that’s been designed to drive conversions.</p>
<p>FAQ pages must have a purpose. Don’t just add one to your website because you feel like it’s a requirement and you want to fill up space.</p>
<p><span id="more-43910"></span></p>
<p>While most websites should have a FAQ page, yours could be doing more harm than good if it doesn’t have any clear intentions. It’s possible that your FAQ page is driving people away from buying, as opposed to drawing them in. Obviously, you don’t want that.</p>
<p>For those of you who are currently neglecting your FAQ page, it’s time to make changes. The rest of you might not have an existing FAQ page and want to add one from scratch.</p>
<p>Regardless of your situation, you’ve come to the right place. I’ll show you how to address common problems with FAQ pages and learn how to optimize them for conversions.</p>
<h3>Ask the “right” questions</h3>
<p>I’ve seen plenty of FAQ pages that have a great design, layout, and optimal user experience. But to be blunt, the questions are awful.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, so many sites have lost the meaning behind frequently asked questions.</p>
<p>Anything related to where your company was founded, how many employees you have, or where your CEO was born does not belong here. You can include details about the history of your company on your about us page. I have a separate guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-create-about-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to create an impactful about us page on your website</a>.</p>
<p>But adding irrelevant or useless questions and answers to your FAQ page is just going to confuse your visitors.</p>
<p>They’ll end up having a more difficult time finding information that will answer their actual question. So you need to have questions that are more related to conversions.</p>
<p>Check out some of the questions on the <a href="https://help.allbirds.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allbirds</a> FAQ page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43911" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/All-Birds-FAQ.png" alt="All Birds FAQ" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/All-Birds-FAQ.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/All-Birds-FAQ-300x196.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/All-Birds-FAQ-768x501.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/All-Birds-FAQ-1024x668.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>This company has an ecommerce platform for selling shoes direct to consumer. So all of the questions are intended to drive sales.</p>
<p>They have questions related to how the shoes fit, sizing, returns, exchanges, refunds, and shipping. All of these are important to the consumer buying decision.</p>
<p>Allbirds does not offer half sizes in their shoes, which is definitely something that might throw some of their shoppers off. But they have questions directly made to address this potential concern.</p>
<p>Do you offer half sizes? Will the shoes stretch? Do the shoes fit a wide foot?</p>
<p>These are all logical questions that someone would ask before buying. You want your customers to feel confident when they’re shopping.</p>
<p>Buying a product, such as sneakers, online can be a challenge. Customers don’t get a chance to try on different sizes, walk around, and see what feels good like they would in a store.</p>
<p>But Allbirds alleviates any uneasiness by asking the right questions on this FAQ page.</p>
<p>If you’re still unsure about how to ask the “right” questions, just see what your customers are actually asking. Take a look at questions and comments from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission forms</li>
<li>Customer emails</li>
<li>Live chat</li>
<li>Social media comments and messages</li>
<li>Phone support</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep a database to track all of these questions and group similar ones. If lots of people are asking the same thing, it definitely belongs on your FAQ page.</p>
<h3>Simplify the navigation</h3>
<p>Like the rest of your website, Your FAQ page must be frictionless.</p>
<p>You might have great questions and answers, but if your site visitors can’t find them, then your FAQ page is going to fail.</p>
<p>Do your best to try and emulate an in-person shopping experience. If a customer was in a physical store, all they would need to do is find an employee and ask their question. Sure, sometimes that employee might direct the customer to another department or something like that. But in the end, the question is answered directly and timely.</p>
<p>Don’t make people hunt for answers on your website.</p>
<p>If the format of your FAQ page is just questions followed by answers repeating all down the page, visitors will have to keep scrolling to find what they’re looking for. This is not ideal. They might even overlook their question, which wouldn’t solve their problem.</p>
<p>Take a look at how <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a> simplifies things on their FAQ page for software downloads.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43912" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Microsoft-FAQ.jpg" alt="Microsoft FAQ" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Microsoft-FAQ.jpg 1652w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Microsoft-FAQ-300x114.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Microsoft-FAQ-768x293.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Microsoft-FAQ-1024x391.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1652px) 100vw, 1652px" /></p>
<p>Right away, you’ll see that there are two categories to choose from.</p>
<p>So the website visitor can narrow the results depending on if their question is related to Windows or Office. That way any Office questions won’t have irrelevant Windows questions that need to be sifted through.</p>
<p>When a user clicks on one of the options, the menu expands, without redirecting to a new page.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like if I click on Office.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43914" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ.jpg" alt="Office FAQ" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ.jpg 1550w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-300x257.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-768x657.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-1024x876.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px" /></p>
<p>All 12 questions can be read without having to scroll. This makes it extremely easy for people to find exactly what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>Now, imagine if there was an answer directly below each of these questions. It would take up probably four or five times the amount of space on the page.</p>
<p>That layout would be much more challenging and require additional scrolling and text to read through. But this approach by Microsoft is clean and simple.</p>
<p>If you want to know something specific, like how long it takes for software to download, just click on the question and the answer will expand below it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43915" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-Expanded.jpg" alt="Office FAQ Expanded" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-Expanded.jpg 1542w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-Expanded-300x116.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-Expanded-768x296.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Office-FAQ-Expanded-1024x394.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1542px) 100vw, 1542px" /></p>
<p>Frictionless.</p>
<p>If a site visitor has multiple questions, it’s still easy for them to navigate and find answers to everything.</p>
<p>Here’s the way you need to look at your FAQ page. If a site visitor has a question and it does not get answered, they aren’t going to convert. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>So if you approach your FAQ page trying to design the navigation in a way that’s optimized for user-experience, then it will increase the chances that people will find what they’re looking for.</p>
<h3>Keep the answers short</h3>
<p>Another common mistake that I see made on FAQ pages is the length of the answers. Everything needs to be clear and concise.</p>
<p>For the most part, your FAQ page should be fairly broad. You want everything to appeal to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So you won’t have super-specific questions that require in-depth explanations.</p>
<p>But even for a general question that most people would ask, you still need to keep the answer concise. You don’t need to answer everything. Certain details can be left out.</p>
<p>I’d rather see FAQ pages with 30 questions that have short answers, as opposed to 15 questions with long answers. So if you currently have long paragraphs on your FAQ page, see if you can take one question and break it down into two or three.</p>
<p>This will provide a much better user experience.</p>
<p>Visitors shouldn’t have to read through an essay or short blog post to get a simple answer.</p>
<p>Let’s say that a website visitor is able to locate their question and ends up reading through a long answer. They might end up having additional questions, based on the length and details of that answer. You don’t want that to happen.</p>
<p>So sharpen your writing skills and only include the most important information related to the question.</p>
<p>Check out this example from the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/b/webapps/mpp/shop/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal</a> FAQ page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43916" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-FAQ.jpg" alt="Paypal FAQ" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-FAQ.jpg 1474w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-FAQ-300x167.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-FAQ-768x428.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-FAQ-1024x571.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1474px) 100vw, 1474px" /></p>
<p>Look at the first question—what is PayPal?</p>
<p>Talk about a loaded question. PayPal is so many different things. They offer services for businesses, consumers, and websites. They could probably answer this question in 50 pages if they wanted to, going into details comparing <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/paypal-vs-stripe-for-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal and Stripe for ecommerce</a>.</p>
<p>But no, they take a much simpler approach. The entire answer is just three sentences.</p>
<p>If they got into all of the specific details of PayPal, what it is, what it does, and who it’s for, it would only confuse the initial question. The answer above is clear, concise, and still answers the question.</p>
<h3>Offer added support</h3>
<p>While a FAQ page should be written to help most of your website visitors with broad questions, sometimes it’s just not enough.</p>
<p>No matter how good your questions are, how great the answers are, or how simple the format is, some people will still need additional assistance. That’s OK.</p>
<p>If it’s going to take a little bit of extra support to get people to convert, then give it to them.</p>
<p>Just make sure that all support options are available. Here’s how <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/#find_a_solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung</a> approaches this on their FAQ page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43917" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Samsung-FAQ.png" alt="Samsung FAQ" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Samsung-FAQ.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Samsung-FAQ-300x166.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Samsung-FAQ-768x426.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Samsung-FAQ-1024x568.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>The first thing I noticed when I landed on this page was the list of categories. Samsung is a huge company, so it makes sense for them to start this way.</p>
<p>But as I stayed on the screen without making any actions for a while, this pop-up window appeared prompting a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-provide-better-customer-service-by-implementing-live-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live chat session</a>.</p>
<p>They obviously have this triggered to appear whenever someone doesn’t scroll or click since the implication would be that they can’t find what they’re looking for. I love this approach.</p>
<p>It’s much better than forcing the site visitor to go back and find another support page or make them go through countless questions manually until they find an answer. That’s just too many added steps.</p>
<p>Put a live chat window directly on your FAQ page.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Samsung has a phone support button in view at all times as well, as I pointed out in the screenshot above. So the customer has options.</p>
<p>Can’t find a solution on the FAQ page? No problem. Just pick up the phone or speak with one of our live chat representatives. This strategy should be incorporated into your FAQ page if you want to drive as many conversions as possible. The extra effort will go a long way.</p>
<h3>Optimize for SEO</h3>
<p>When you’re crafting a high-converting FAQ page, you need to keep the big picture of your website in mind. Nothing screams big picture louder than SEO.</p>
<p>For the most part, FAQ pages are designed with the idea that a visitor will land somewhere on your website, have a question, and then navigate to the FAQ page. In many cases, this very well might be the case.</p>
<p>However, you can set up your FAQ page to get traffic directly from organic searches as well.</p>
<p>So every question doesn’t need to be brand-specific. For example, let’s say your website offered <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web hosting plans for small businesses</a>. Your FAQ page could ask, what is shared web hosting?</p>
<p>This question isn’t exclusive to one of your products or services. But it’s definitely something that one of your prospective customers will search for online. Your question could end up in the SERPs, driving more traffic to your website, and ultimately leading to conversions.</p>
<p>A great tip for finding SEO questions is to just use Google.</p>
<p>Let’s say you sell sneakers. Type in keywords that you’re trying to rank for, like “sneakers for travel,” and then scroll to the bottom to view related searches.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43918" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Google-Results.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Google-Results.jpg 1478w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Google-Results-300x111.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Google-Results-768x285.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Google-Results-1024x380.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1478px) 100vw, 1478px" /></p>
<p>Based on these search suggestions, you can get SEO-inspired questions for your FAQ page.</p>
<p>So you can add questions related to shoes for walking all day or stylish shoes for Europe.</p>
<p>Another way to improve your SEO is by creating dedicated landing pages for your questions. Now, this slightly contradicts what we talked about earlier in terms of user experience. Redirecting people every time they want to see a new question could be a bit annoying.</p>
<p>However, these dedicated landing pages that interlink with each other can give you a boost in terms of SEO, if your website architecture and sitemap are optimized properly.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>FAQ pages are critical resources for your website visitors.</p>
<p>Anyone who lands on this page is on the verge of converting. Sometimes getting a question answered is all it takes for them to finalize a decision.</p>
<p>So stop wasting time and space with FAQ pages that don’t add real value to your site.</p>
<p>Focus on questions that are related to conversions. Keep the user experience in mind by simplifying your design and writing concise answers. Offer additional support options for people who still have questions. Go the extra mile and optimize your FAQ pages for SEO.</p>
<p>If you follow the tips that I’ve covered in this guide, you can turn your FAQ page into a conversion machine.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ecommerce industry is booming.</p>
<p>People are buying products online more than ever before. Nearly anything you can imagine can be purchased on the Internet and delivered to your doorstep. It’s a great time to be a consumer.</p>
<p>But as an entrepreneur, you can leverage this craze by creating your own ecommerce shop.</p>
<p>You can take advantage of this opportunity and start an online store from virtually anywhere with Internet access. While technology has made it easier than ever for consumers to buy, it’s also easier than ever before to start an online business.</p>
<p>Sure, there are a handful of things that you need to figure out. You’ll have to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/create-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a website</a>, choose an ecommerce platform, pick a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web hosting service</a>, and learn how to market your brand online.</p>
<p>But before you get ahead of yourself and start all of that, you need to figure out what you’re going to sell.</p>
<p><span id="more-43895"></span></p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been talking to so many entrepreneurs who want to sell online, but they just don’t know what to offer. That’s what inspired me to write this guide.</p>
<p>Using in-depth research and trend analysis, I’ve come up with a list of nine popular products that you can sell online in 2019. Use this guide as an inspiration for your ecommerce shop.</p>
<h3>1. Groceries</h3>
<p>When most people think about selling products online, they automatically think of new gadgets or products that are designed for everyday use around the house. Or they try to think of something innovative that will solve a common problem.</p>
<p>However, it seems like people rarely think to sell food.</p>
<p>Consumers are buying everything else online, so why not groceries? It’s something that everyone uses on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Take a look at the current and projected growth of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/293707/us-online-grocery-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online grocery sales</a> in the United States alone.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43904" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Online-Grocery-Sales.png" alt="Online Grocery Sales" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Online-Grocery-Sales.png 1384w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Online-Grocery-Sales-300x220.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Online-Grocery-Sales-768x563.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Online-Grocery-Sales-1024x750.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1384px) 100vw, 1384px" /></p>
<p>By 2021, experts predict that this will become a $30 billion industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1915/us-consumers-online-grocery-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online food and beverage industry</a> is growing at 18% year-over-year</p>
<p>While the majority of grocery shopping still takes place in physical store locations, the ecommerce grocery movement is the way of the future. So this is a great chance for you to jump on board before the market gets too saturated.</p>
<p>There are seemingly endless opportunities here. You could sell anything from snacks, to produce, to prepared and pre-packaged meals.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is plenty of money to be made in this space if you’re able to carve out the right niche. Just make sure you educate yourself about the legal aspects of selling food online, as the regulations are different from selling other products.</p>
<h3>2. Electric scooters</h3>
<p>If you live near any major American city, you’ve probably seen the rise of electric scooter usage over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Depending on the area, this trend has seemingly taken over the streets and sidewalk.</p>
<p>Companies like Bird, Lime, and Razor are pioneering the scooter ridesharing industry. Even bigger names like Uber and Lyft have entered the e-scooter space.</p>
<p>The idea behind ridesharing scooters is great.</p>
<p>Essentially, riders just use a mobile app to locate and start a scooter. Then they ride to a destination and park it anywhere. They are charged based on usage and everything is handled through the mobile app.</p>
<p>With this trend growing in popularity, it seems like more and more people want to own electric scooters, as opposed to just using the rideshare options.</p>
<p>In 2018, there were roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/801972/global-retail-sales-forecast-for-electric-scooters-and-bicycles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 million</a> electric scooters and electric bicycles sold worldwide. That number is expected to reach 50 million in 2020.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity for you to seize. That’s because high-end products can be sold at a higher price point.</p>
<p>Research shows that the <a href="https://www.razor.com/blog/how-much-does-an-electric-scooter-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average cost of an electric scooter</a> is roughly $300. But some high-end models can retail for more than double that amount.</p>
<h3>3. Virtual reality headsets</h3>
<p>Virtual reality and augmented reality are increasing in popularity.</p>
<p>If you read my blog on a regular basis, you know that augmented reality already made my list of the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/mobile-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top mobile trends that are dominating 2019</a>. I also wrote about how augmented reality is impacting <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/augmented-reality-seo-what-to-expect-in-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the future of SEO</a>.</p>
<p>But now I want to take a moment to talk about the business opportunity for the virtual reality market. First, let me clarify the differences between AR and VR.</p>
<p>AR uses overlays on computer-generated screens to put digital figures into real-world images. For example, AR can be used on a smartphone to play games like Pokemon Go.</p>
<p>As the name implies, VR puts users into a virtual world, using more specialized and sophisticated equipment, like a VR headset.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/virtual-and-augmented-reality-users-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth of VR and AR users</a> in the United States.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43905" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VR-AR-Growth.png" alt="VR AR Growth" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VR-AR-Growth.png 952w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VR-AR-Growth-300x294.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VR-AR-Growth-768x753.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px" /></p>
<p>As you can clearly see from the graph, both VR and AR users are growing each year.</p>
<p>There are more AR users, simple because augmented reality is easier to use and doesn’t require special equipment.</p>
<p>With that said, the number of virtual reality headset users is still continuing to grow and carve out a good-sized market share in this niche.</p>
<p>In 2017, there were roughly 11 million VR headset users in the US. That number has already doubled and will reach 26.5 million users by 2021.</p>
<p>There are lots of potential consumers to target with this product. According to a virtual reality <a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/best-vr-headset-oculus-rift-samsung-gear-htc-vive-virtual-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">headset review by The Verge</a>, VR headsets have quite the price range. Inexpensive headsets can be bought for less than $100, while higher-end models retail for upwards of $800.</p>
<h2>4. Smart speakers</h2>
<p>As long as we’re on the technology subject, I figured this would be a good time to talk about smart speakers. This is another trend that’s growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Today, in 2019, there are more than <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-smart-speaker-users-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">74 million smart speaker owners</a> in the United States.</p>
<p>However, this only makes up 26% of US Internet users, meaning that there is still plenty of room for growth in this space.</p>
<p>China has that most smart speaker owners in the world, with 85 million. But this makes up just 10% of the country’s total Internet users. Again, this proves a high global demand for the product, with tons of room for growth in the category.</p>
<p>Speaking of growth, look at the number of <a href="https://marketingland.com/survey-reports-118-million-smart-speakers-in-u-s-but-the-expectation-of-future-demand-is-way-down-254937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">households in America</a> that have a smart speaker.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43907" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smart-Speakers.png" alt="Smart Speakers" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smart-Speakers.png 900w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smart-Speakers-300x219.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smart-Speakers-768x561.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>There was a 78% growth rate between 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>Here’s a crazier statistic. More than half of smart speaker owners have two or more devices.</p>
<p>This means that current smart speaker owners are still potential customers for you. This product is a great opportunity to sell online via your ecommerce shop.</p>
<h2>5. Vapor products</h2>
<p>E-cigarettes and electronic vaporizers, better known as “vapes” are growing in popularity.</p>
<p>There are several different components to vapor products. There is the device itself, which operates by heating a liquid solution. Then there are the flavored liquids, usually containing nicotine. Plus there are other accessories as well, and these products come in all different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I’m not here to talk about the health risks of vaping or anything like that. Nor am I encouraging the use of e-cigarettes or nicotine products.</p>
<p>But like every other product on this list, I’m simply identifying market trends and sharing the information with you. These trends are telling me that it’s a hot category.</p>
<p>By 2023, the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-vapor-products-market-outlook-and-forecast-2018-2023-market-and-is-expected-to-cross-43-billion-by-2023-300589389.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global vapor market</a> is expected to reach $43 billion. That’s a 15% compound annual growth rate for five years. The figures are impressive, to stay the least.</p>
<p>There is definitely a market for this product, and plenty of money to be made by selling vapor products online. Just make sure you comply with all of the legal regulations associated with selling vapes and accessories through an ecommerce shop.</p>
<h2>6. Jewelry</h2>
<p>Jewelry is another product category with seemingly endless opportunities for online sales.</p>
<p>You can target men, women, children, and teenagers with high-end diamonds, low-end rings, and everything in between. There are so many options for products and targets in this industry.</p>
<p>Plus, you can even make jewelry by hand. More than 2 million handmade jewelry products are <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/handmade_jewelry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold on Etsy</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43908" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Etsy.png" alt="Etsy" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Etsy.png 1310w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Etsy-300x251.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Etsy-768x643.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Etsy-1024x857.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px" /></p>
<p>Studies show that the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/brandfeatures/venture-capital/article?id=48368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global online jewelry market</a> is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 16% between now and 2022.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-fashion-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Shopify</a>, ecommerce only represents 4-5% of all jewelry sales worldwide. However, that number is expected to be 10-15% by 2020.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Jewelry sales, like most products, are starting to trend in the ecommerce direction. There is so much room for growth in the coming years with this product category.</p>
<h2>7. Digital courses and learning material</h2>
<p>You don’t always need to sell tangible products on your ecommerce shop. You can also sell digital goods like ebooks or online learning courses.</p>
<p>This is another booming industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/31/e-learning-climbing-to-325-billion-by-2025-uf-canvas-absorb-schoology-moodle/#6d459f973b39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Forbes</a>, the e-learning industry is going to reach $325 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>There are so many potential customers here as well. In fact, <a href="https://techjury.net/stats-about/elearning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">77% of corporations in the US</a> use online learning tools. E-learning increases retention rates by up 60%.</p>
<p>So if you’re good at something, take advantage of it. Teach others how to do whatever it is that you know best.</p>
<p>Product content like blogs, ebooks, and videos. Then sell those digital goods online.</p>
<p>The best part about this is the low overhead. Your only costs will be running your website, processing transactions, and your time. Everything else is just straight profit.</p>
<h2>8. Drones</h2>
<p>The drone market is segmented into two categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer</li>
<li>Commercial</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s actually a military category too, but that’s not really relevant for ecommerce purposes.</p>
<p>While you might be tempted to just target the average Joe who wants to flow a drone around his neighborhood, you might want to consider the commercial market as well. Check out the <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17201/commecial-drones-projected-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth of commercial drones</a> over the years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43909" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Drones.png" alt="Drones" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Drones.png 1476w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Drones-300x193.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Drones-768x493.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Drones-1024x658.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1476px) 100vw, 1476px" /></p>
<p>Between now and 2025, the global commercial drone market is expected to grow by roughly 700%. Now is the time to jump on this trend to get your share of the action.</p>
<p>You can still go after consumers as well. The unit sales of personal drones dominate <a href="https://www.toptal.com/finance/market-research-analysts/drone-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">94% of the market</a>. However, this only represents 40% of the total revenue share, since commercial drones are typically priced higher.</p>
<h2>9. Clothing and accessories</h2>
<p>It may sound simple, obvious, or boring, but the online clothing industry is huge.</p>
<p>But in order to be successful here, you definitely need to go after a niche. Trying to sell to anyone and everyone will be too competitive to survive.</p>
<p>By 2023, revenue from online clothing, footwear, and accessories in the US is expected to surpass <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278890/us-apparel-and-accessories-retail-e-commerce-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$145.7 billion</a>. That’s up from $93 billion in 2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.g2.com/online-shopping-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">58% of Americans</a> have purchased clothing online.</p>
<p>Again, this is another industry where you have tons of options. There are different types of people to target, and countless options of products to sell at varying price points. Ultimately, there’s lots of money to be made selling clothes online.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There has never been a better time to sell products online. Starting an ecommerce store is easy, and consumers are continuing to buy products on the Internet more and more each year.</p>
<p>But what should you sell online?</p>
<p>Use this list as a reference. Unlike other similar posts that you’ll find online, I took the time to actually research industries and trends. I didn’t just pull random products out of thin air.</p>
<p>That’s why this information is so valuable. If you can set up your ecommerce shop around these trends, it has a much greater chance of being successful.</p>

<h2 id="best-shared-hosting">The Best Shared Web Hosting</h2>
<p>For the vast majority of folks, you’ll want shared web hosting.</p>
<p>Shared web hosting means that your website is on the same server as other websites. Most sites are small enough that they don’t need an entire server to themselves so web hosts bundle a bunch of sites together and put them all on the same server.</p>
<p>This is how web hosts get the price of hosting down.</p>
<p>In most cases, it’s a great deal.</p>
<p>The biggest downside to shared hosting is that another site can take your site down with it. If several sites are on the same server and one of those sites gets a huge traffic spike that takes the server down, all the sites go down. So it’s possible for your site to go down at no fault of your own.</p>
<p>In practice, this rarely happens. Especially for smaller sites that can handle a little downtime every once in awhile, having shared hosting is a great trade-off in order to get the hosting bill lowered.</p>
<p>Think of shared hosting as the ideal “entry-level” package for your site.</p>
<p>So which hosting companies are the best for shared hosting? These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siteground</a> &#8211; Best overall host and plenty of room to scale as your site grows</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InMotion</a> &#8211; Best customer support</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost</a> &#8211; Best overall heap host</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HostGator</a> &#8211; Best cheap host with support included</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-cloud-hosting">The Best Cloud Hosting</h2>
<p>If you’re building a larger site or want to guarantee your uptime, you’ll want to look for cloud hosting.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting is a bit different than shared hosting.</p>
<p>Instead of a bunch of different sites using the same server, your site will get spread across multiple servers. This has a few major advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other sites can’t take your site down. If they get a spike, your server can simply start using other servers.</li>
<li>You can quickly scale your site bandwidth up and down. Since you’re already using multiple servers, it’s really easy to add more or take some away.</li>
<li>Since there’s redundancy across multiple servers, server uptime gets a lot better.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these benefits do come with a higher cost. No matter which cloud host you choose, it will be noticeably more expensive than a shared hosting package.</p>
<p>I use the 50,000 visitors rule. If my site has above 50,000 visitors a month or will in the foreseeable future, I move it to cloud hosting.</p>
<p>Consider cloud hosting if you’re planning on building a large site or have a business that can’t afford any downtime whatsoever.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siteground</a> &#8211; Best overall cloud hosting</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10154/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Engine</a> &#8211; Best cloud hosting for WordPress</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-small-business-hosting">The Best Small Business Hosting</h2>
<p>Any small business owner has a lot on their plate. Marketing, managing the service or product delivery, all the back-office tasks, it adds up. Resources are also limited so if something breaks, the owner has to fix it themselves. And on top of all that, they need to watch every dollar. Every extra dollar in an expense means one less dollar in their pocket.</p>
<p>The best web hosts for small business are super reliable, have world-class support when the odd issue does come up, and have a reasonable price. This minimizes the extra tasks for the owner while also keeping expenses low. And when things do go wrong, a solid support team makes the fix as painless as possible.</p>
<p>You’re looking for that sweet spot between price, reliability, and an amazing support team.</p>
<p>These are the best web hosts that excel at all three:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InMotion</a> &#8211; Best customer support with straightforward plans</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround</a> &#8211; Best overall web host</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-wordpress-hosting">The Best WordPress Hosting</h2>
<p>Blogs are one of my favorite ways to build traffic and customers. I’ve managed multiple sites with hundreds of thousands or millions of visitors per month.</p>
<p>When it comes to blogs, WordPress is by far the best option for running the blog.</p>
<p>These days, I always get managed WordPress hosting for my high traffic blogs. Managed WordPress hosting is a specialized hosting package built entirely around WordPress.</p>
<p>There’s a few major advantages to getting specialized WordPress hosting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything is streamlined around WordPress</li>
<li>Security is extra tight</li>
<li>WordPress updates and server maintenance happen automatically</li>
<li>Backups happen automatically</li>
<li>The support team has advanced knowledge of WordPress</li>
<li>The site can handle much higher traffic volume since everything is built around WordPress</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one major downside though: the cost.</p>
<p>Managed WordPress hosting tends to be more expensive. If you’re building a site with the goal to generate tons of traffic (50,000+ visitors/month), it’s absolutely worth it. I go this route even if I don’t have the traffic volume yet. As long as I’ve set a goal to build that traffic over time, I’ll choose a managed WordPress host from the beginning.</p>
<p>What about smaller sites that want to use WordPress?</p>
<p>In that case, skip the managed WordPress hosting. The premium features won’t provide enough value to justify the extra cost. Just about every host out there allows you to install WordPress easily and quickly.</p>
<p>Our favorite WordPress hosts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10154/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Engine</a> &#8211; Best managed WordPress hosting for high traffic blogs</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround</a> &#8211; A standard host with great WordPress features for smaller sites</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-cheap-hosting">The Best Cheap Hosting</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you need to stretch every dollar.</p>
<p>Whatever the circumstances, there are ways to save on your hosting bills. And since they recur every month, getting them as low as possible does add up over time.</p>
<p>I want to give you a quick warning though.</p>
<p>On web hosts, you can definitely go TOO cheap. There is a point where reducing the costs any further seriously impacts the quality of your hosting. Your site will be down on a regular basis, you’ll never be able to get a competent support rep to help you, and every task you try to complete will have a horrendous user experience.</p>
<p>We’ve found the best cheap web hosts. While their service isn’t quite as good as the others that we recommend, it’s good enough if you&#8217;re trying to get the cost down. Just be careful about shopping around for even cheaper deals, it’s usually too good to be true.</p>
<p>We recommend these two hosts if you’re trying to get the cost as low as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreamhost</a> &#8211; best overall cheap hosting</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hostgator</a> &#8211; best cheap hosting with support included</li>
</ul>
<p>They’re also good for side projects or ideas that you’re playing around with. Then if it becomes a real project or business, you can always switch to one of the better hosts later.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-the-best-hosting">How To Find The Best Hosting For You</h2>
<p>Before divining into all the criteria on how to evaluate web hosts, I have some simple rules for you on picking your web host:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you plan on building a high traffic WordPress blog, get <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10154/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Engine</a>. The extra cost is well worth it. This is also a good option for folks that want to pay a little extra so they never have to worry about anything related to their hosting.</li>
<li>For all other sites, get a web host that’s fast, has great uptime, and amazing support. <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siteground</a> and <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InMotion</a> are your best bets here.</li>
<li>If you really want to get the cost down, do with <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreamhost</a> or <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hostgator</a>. Both are decent at low prices. I wouldn’t consider hosts that are any cheaper than this though.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these rules, you’ll be happy with the host that you get and won’t have to switch any time soon.</p>
<p>So how do we evaluate web hosts? What actually matters?</p>
<p>Let’s go through all the key items.</p>
<h3>Site Uptime</h3>
<p>If people can’t access your site, why have it at all?</p>
<p>First and foremost, you want a web host with great uptime. This means you’re site is always available and never goes down.</p>
<p>To try to avoid the “just trust us” promise of near-perfect uptime, most hosts provide some sort of guarantee of at least 99.9 percent uptime. However, that guarantee isn’t much of a guarantee. It just means your bill can be discounted in the event of any unplanned downtime. There’s a lot of fine print on these guarantees, too, including not accepting self-reported or third-party uptime data, and not providing refunds for downtime that was out of the host’s control (for example, a hurricane).</p>
<h3>Site Speed</h3>
<p>Site speed impacts everything related to your site. Want search rankings? Get a fast site. Want conversions on your site? Make it fast. Want happy users? Speed it up.</p>
<p>Every part of your business is impacted by the speed of your site.</p>
<p>When looking at different web hosts, make sure you’re choosing a host that can serve every page lickity split.</p>
<p>There is some nuance with site speed.</p>
<p>In the early days, you need a host that’s fast “enough.” It doesn’t have to be blistering fast but it needs to be fast. Think of Amazon. Back in the day when Amazon just sold books, their site needed to be fast but it didn’t need to be instantaneous. Now that many people use it for all their shopping, Amazon’s site can’t be fast enough.</p>
<p>The bigger you get, the faster you’ll want to be. If you’re planning on building a high-traffic site, you’ll want a host that can maintain crazy-fast speeds on large sites.</p>
<h3>Customer Support</h3>
<p>When running your own site, web host customer support is the single most important thing a web host can offer.</p>
<p>Digging through use reviews doesn’t always give you a conclusive answer on the quality of support at a particular web host.</p>
<p>There can be a discrepancy between reviews and quality. Take, for example, HostGator. Technology publications tend to rank its products highly: it earns a score of 4.5 out of 5 on both <a href="https://www.cnet.com/web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNET</a> and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/316108/the-best-web-hosting-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCMag</a>. But it has 1 star on <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.bluehost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trustpilot</a> and only 37 percent of nearly 600 users give it 5 stars on <a href="https://www.whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/bluehost/#top-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhoIsHostingThis</a> — and nearly all of negative comments are directed at customer service.</p>
<p>Watch out for glowing reviews on top publications, they don’t always reflect reality.</p>
<p>There is one true test for assessing the customer support quality at any host.</p>
<p>The free trial customer support test.</p>
<p>Pretty much every web host has some sort of money-back guarantee on their shared hosting plans, which means you can set up your website and see what you think of the service with relatively low stakes — just your time and any add-on fees you opt into, like paying for domain registration. We recommend going to town with customer support during that trial period. Get on live chat, open tickets, hop on the phone as much as possible to see if you like what you’re being served up.</p>
<p>Most web hosts offer some sort of free trial period. I recommend using this time to really dig into your host’s customer support — its knowledge center and especially support staff across all channels. That’ll tell you the real story.</p>
<h3>Traffic Volume</h3>
<p>The amount of traffic that you get has a huge impact on the hosting that you need.</p>
<p>For a site that gets 300 visitors every month, pretty much any standard hosting package will be good enough. As long as your web host has strong customer support, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>As you get bigger, all sorts of small details start to matter a lot more.</p>
<p>Is the PHP on your server being updated regularly? Do you have a CDN for your content? Is your site being backed up daily and can you restore it within 15 minutes if something goes wrong? Do you have an SSL certificate? Can your server handle a giant traffic spike during a marketing promotion?</p>
<p>Whenever I have a larger site, I look for premium hosting that takes care of all this for me. And if I’m planning on building a large site, I look for a host that can easily scale to millions of visitors per month. I’m happy to pay a premium price in order to guarantee easy upgrades in the future.</p>
<p>Don’t skimp if you’re going big.</p>
<p>And if you plan to stay under 50,000 visitors/month, get a standard shared hosting package. There’s no reason to worry about the advanced stuff.</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>While you don’t want to overpay on hosting, you definitely don’t want to underpay either.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a host exclusively on price.</p>
<p>Most basic web hosting plans are in the $10-$20/month range. Yes, there are cheaper options. Some of them are promotional offers that go away at renewals. Others are hosting plans with terrible support and uptime.</p>
<p>My rule is if the price sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>I also don’t worry about chasing promotional offers to save a few dollars. For every site I’ve ever managed, we used our host for years on end without ever switching once we had a host we were happy with. Promotional offers come and go pretty quickly.</p>
<h3>Migration Features</h3>
<p>The ability to easily and quickly migrate an existing site will save you weeks of time.</p>
<p>Even a basic WordPress site can be a real hassle to migrate. First you have to set up a new WordPress install on your new host. Then you need to export the database of content from your old site and import it into your new one. Finally you have to re-configure everything in WordPress like the theme, plugins, and settings.</p>
<p>That’s a real pain and that’s why we put together <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/the-simple-guide-to-moving-your-wordpress-site-to-a-new-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an entire guide on WordPress migration</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible to skip all this.</p>
<p>Some hosts will offer a 1-click migration for popular site builders like WordPress.</p>
<p>If you’re switching hosts and handling the migration yourself, look for an easy migration feature. This is a great way to make the final decision once you’ve narrowed it down to a few final options.</p>
<h3>Managed Hosting</h3>
<p>Here’s how a normal host works:</p>
<ul>
<li>After you sign up, you get a login.</li>
<li>The login takes you to cPanel. The cPanel is an app on your server that lets you manage it through a UI without needing to know how to code anything.</li>
<li>You configure your server however you want.</li>
<li>There’s a FTP option to upload files manually to your server.</li>
<li>There are also quick options for installing WordPress and other site software if you want.</li>
<li>You get full access and can do anything you want. It’s a “choose your own adventure.” Install WordPress, Drupal, Magento, or code your entire site by hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most web hosts work like this.</p>
<p>There are also managed web hosts. These hosts customize the hosting environment and manage a lot more of it for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10154/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Engine</a> is the best example, they’re a managed host for WordPress. Instead of getting a cPanel login that lets me do anything I want, WP Engine gives me a login to their custom interface that’s built to manage WordPress sites specifically.</p>
<p>When a web host is optimized exclusively for WordPress, three key things happen. First: It gets faster than pretty much any shared hosting provider can dream of. Everything can be tailored to making WordPress work its best, whether that’s optimizing website caching or tinkering with the command line tools. The host only needs to know how to support WordPress, as opposed to, say, Joomla and a Node server and some sort of custom-made site and on and on.</p>
<p>Second: Sites get more secure and stable. A managed WordPress host can build a system that predicts, accommodates, and patches all of WordPress’s vulnerabilities. That means fewer malicious attacks and less downtime.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly for small businesses: Admin and site maintenance get a lot easier. And that service is vital because managed WordPress hosting is significantly more expensive than shared web hosting.</p>
<p>While I give up some flexibility from not having a basic web server like other hosts, a managed host takes care of a lot of ongoing tasks that I’d normally have to handle myself.</p>
<p>If you have a small business site, a normal host is fine. If you’re building a larger site, a managed host will save you a ton of time in the long run and is worth the extra cost.</p>
<h3>Shared, Virtual Private Servers, Cloud, and Dedicated Hosting</h3>
<p>Let’s start with definitions on the types of hosting your can buy.</p>
<p><b>Shared hosting</b> means that you share space with a bunch of other sites on the same server. The advantage is that it’s a lot cheaper. The downside is that other sites can impact the performance of your site. If someone else gets a huge traffic spike, it could impact everybody on that server before the web host throttles their traffic.</p>
<p><b>Virtual private servers (VPS)</b> also has multiple sites on the same server But these sites have dedicated space that’s managed by software. You get many of the benefits of having a dedicated server (you own IP address, less volatility in uptime, etc) without needing an entire server for just yourself. But the performance isn’t quite as good as having your own server to yourself.</p>
<p><b>Cloud hosting</b> is similar to VPS but instead of having space on once server, you get space across multiple servers. Like VPS, it’s resilient to traffic spikes from other sites. If a site on your same server takes that server down, your host simply moves your site to another server. That’s why they call it “cloud” hosting. It’s also extremely scalable for your own site. Adding more resources to your site is a breeze since your host only needs to increase the total server resources that you can consume at any given time. Because of these advantages, it does tend to be more expensive.</p>
<p><b>Dedicated hosting</b> gives you a server just for you. No one else gets space on that server. You’ll also be in complete control and can configure that server however you want.</p>
<p>Which of these should you get? Here are some simple rules of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small sites should be on shared hosting. Any impact from other sites on the same site will be minor. This is the best option for any site that does 50,000 visitors per month or less.</li>
<li>When you get over 50,00 visitors/month, move towards cloud hosting and then a dedicated host if you really need it. Don’t worry about a dedicated host until spending thousands of dollars per month on hosting sounds like a rounding error in your annual budget.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ignore Free Web Hosting</h3>
<p>For just about everyone, free hosting is not worth it.</p>
<p>Web hosting is not where you should save money. If you’re worried about the price of hosting, I’d say you need to worry about generating revenue and traffic before trying to save a few extra dollars cutting hosting costs.</p>
<p>A free host is only good for something like an event one-pager or an extremely small, extremely low-traffic site. If you are doing either of those things, you should still skip the free host route and jump straight to a free website builder that’ll let you link your site to a custom domain for free, like <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10159/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UCraft</a> or <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10158/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sites</a>. They’re both <i>very</i> basic limited builders, but they are easier to get up and running than a free web host.</p>
<p>That being said, there are some great free and discount web hosting plans for nonprofits and educators. If that’s you and you want to know more, head over to my <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-free-web-hosting/#alternatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best free web hosts review</a>.

<h2 id="web-hosting-reviews">Web Hosting Reviews</h2>
<p>Here are individual reviews of all the top web hosts.</p>
<h3 id="siteground-review">SiteGround Hosting Review</h3>
<p>Best For:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared Hosting</li>
<li>Cloud Hosting</li>
<li>Businesses</li>
<li>WordPress</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround</a> has one of the best reputations among web hosts with a rabid fan base and glowing reviews.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-43989" src="http://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Hosting-Reviews-1024x397.jpg" alt="SiteGround Hosting Reviews" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Hosting-Reviews-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Hosting-Reviews-300x116.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Hosting-Reviews-768x297.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Hosting-Reviews.jpg 1322w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Along with DreamHost and Bluehost, SiteGround is one of WordPress’s three recommended web hosts. WordPress hosting is built into all of its shared hosting plans, you’ll get automatic updates, streamlined security, and expert technical support.</p>
<p>SiteGround is widely considered to be a leader in shared hosting. Its servers are ultra fast and extra secure, and SiteGround is constantly deploying new updates to keep them that way.</p>
<p>While all its shared hosting plans are powerful, SiteGround is especially well-known for its highest-tier shared plan, GoGeek, which is suped up with tools developers will find especially useful, including a staging server and Git repo creation. Lots of small business and personal websites will probably find this overkill, but if your needs are more complex than the basics, SiteGround has a lot to love.</p>
<p>There is one downside. Once you blow through SiteGround’s introductory pricing, your plan’s price will triple. For example, its lowest tier of shared hosting jumps from $4/month to $12 and its highest tier jumps from $12/month to $35. That doesn’t feel great. In fact, it was the reason for most of the one-star reviews on TrustPilot. Watch for this when you’re comparing pricing and remember that your hosting plan will last a lot longer than the promotional period.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-43990" src="http://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Renewal-Prices-1024x667.jpg" alt="SiteGround Renewal Prices" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Renewal-Prices-1024x667.jpg 1024w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Renewal-Prices-300x196.jpg 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Renewal-Prices-768x501.jpg 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Renewal-Prices.jpg 1304w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>SiteGround also has the shortest trial period of all our other shared hosting our top picks: only 30 days. This isn’t a major problem though. You’ll be able to easily evaluate any host within a month.</p>
<p>SiteGround does have cloud hosting and dedicated servers. In fact, SiteGround is one of our top picks for cloud hosting. If you think there’s a chance that you’ll need to upgrade to some serious hosting power once you generate lots of traffic, SiteGround is a great option that will make upgrades easy later.</p>
<p>SiteGround’s customer support is available 24/7 across all channels — phone, chat, and email — and its knowledge base is rich and well-organized.</p>
<p>SiteGround also has the most transparent uptime: it has a 99.9% annual uptime guarantee (or you get a month of hosting free) and posts both its annual average and the previous month’s uptime <a href="https://www.siteground.com/web-hosting.htm#tab-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right on its site</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43991" src="http://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Uptime.png" alt="SiteGround Uptime" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Uptime.png 600w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SiteGround-Uptime-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>SiteGround’s annual uptime compared to last month’s.</p>
<p>SiteGround is an amazing option for businesses with room to grow. There’s plenty of upgrades to support you along the way.</p>
<p>Just watch out for the promotion pricing that goes away at your first renewal.</p>
<h3 id="inmotion-hosting-review">InMotion Hosting Review</h3>
<p>Best For:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small Businesses</li>
<li>Shared Hosting</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InMotion</a> may not look flashy, but it’s a solid web host with truly excellent technology, a wide assortment of plans, and a legion of longtime customers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43992" src="http://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/InMotion-Hosting-Review.png" alt="InMotion Hosting Review" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/InMotion-Hosting-Review.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/InMotion-Hosting-Review-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>Its massive self-help knowledge base is the industry standard, and customer support is among the best. Don’t believe it? Try for yourself. InMotion’s 90-day free trial period for shared hosting is one of the longest around and gives you plenty of time to test out InMotion’s support team.</p>
<p>InMotion’s plans are really straightforward and almost identical. As you upgrade, you’ll get faster servers and extra databases, websites, and subdomains. It’s a straightforward approach we like, especially for small businesses and websites that aren’t overly complex. No pushy upsells or confusing tiers to worry about.</p>
<p>Even the entry level plans has excellent customer support. It’s 24/7 via 5 communication channels: phone, chat, email, tutorials, and Q&amp;A, which were actively answered. I also appreciate that none of this support is hidden or hard to find. The phone number is broadcast at the top of the page and the chat support login is easy to find in your admin panel. There’s nothing more annoying than 24/7 support that requires you first unearth the contact methods on your own. It’s a waste of time and tells me exactly what I need to know about the host.</p>
<p>I also appreciate that the support is available at your level — whether you’re just starting and need someone to walk you through the ultimate basics with a friendly and supportive demeanor, or you want someone who can talk specs and technical nuances like a pro, the InMotion support has you covered.</p>
<p>InMotion’s support is what makes it stand out from other hosts. If you’re looking for a no-nonsense host with an amazing customer support, InMotion is you best option. It’s our favorite pick for small businesses because you’ll be able to get all the help you need.</p>
<p>InMotion regularly runs promo pricing, with deals that start as low as $5/month. Normal pricing for shared hosting bumps up to $8–$9/month after the initial contract is up.</p>
<p>In addition to shared hosting, InMotion offers upgrades to managed WordPress hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated servers.</p>
<h3 id="wpengine-review">WP Engine Review</h3>
<p>Best For:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>High Traffic Blogs</li>
</ul>
<p>When most people think of managed WordPress hosting, they think <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10154/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Engine</a>. And for good reason — it provides a truly excellent product. It does come at a price though. A fully managed WordPress host is noticeably more expensive than shared hosting providers. WP Engine’s lowest-priced plan is $35/month, and that’s only for one 10GB site with max 25,000 visitors/month.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43993" src="http://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WP-Engine-Hosting-Plans.png" alt="WP Engine Hosting Plans" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WP-Engine-Hosting-Plans.png 800w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WP-Engine-Hosting-Plans-300x176.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WP-Engine-Hosting-Plans-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>But when you factor in what WP Engine does for that price, it’s an incredibly appealing option for WordPress site owners. As a managed WordPress host, WP Engine only provides service to WordPress users, which means its entire infrastructure can be optimized for WordPress. You’re site will be wicked fast, there’s virtually no downtime, and lots of maintenance tasks get taken care of automatically. If you want a blazing fast site where everything is taken care of automatically, you’ll want WP Engine.</p>
<p>Customer support is also laser-focused on WordPress, which makes for highly competent knowledgeable support staff available through tracked tickets and on live chat 24/7.</p>
<p>Just be mindful of the price. You’ll be paying more in order to get a lot more.</p>
<h3 id="dreamhost-review">Dreamhost Review</h3>
<p>Best For:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared Hosting</li>
<li>Cheap Hosting Packages</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost</a> is notable for doing things its own way. It doesn’t use the standard cPanel that most hosts use. It has built a completely custom control panel that you’ll use to manage your website. Many of Dreamhosts do love it but it could make things much more difficult should you ever need to migrate off Dreamhost. I wouldn’t plan on migrations into Dreamhost to be easy either. So it’s a great option for brand new sites.</p>
<p>In addition to shared hosting and managed WordPress hosting, DreamHost offers upgrades to VPS and cloud hosting, as well as dedicated servers should you ever need them.</p>
<p>What’s really worth noting is the outstanding offers DreamHost has for nonprofits: one free Unlimited shared hosting plan (which includes unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited sites, and email hosting) for 501(c)(3) organizations, plus a 35% discount on the suped-up DreamPress managed WordPress hosting. That’s a fantastic deal.</p>
<p>DreamHost is another one of WordPress’s three recommended hosts, and includes some managed WordPress hosting in its basic shared plans. It also offers a managed plan with more bells and whistles called DreamPress. Monthly plans under $3/month are available if you pay annually, $8/month if you’d like to add email. It does have an industry-leading free trial period — a full 97-day money-back guarantee — and transparent pricing that doesn’t increase after your initial contract.</p>
<p>Customer service is a little less traditional: email support is available 24/7, but live chat is only on during business hours, and you actually have to pay $9.95 to get technical support over the phone. DreamHost calls this a “nominal fee” — I call this annoying. If you would like lots of support while you set up your site, I’d pick a different host.</p>
<p>That said, the free trial period is the longest in the business — 97 days. Shared hosting plans start at $2.59/month, and since DreamHost doesn’t do promo pricing, it won’t jump after your first contract is up. This is one of the lowest hosting prices out there, it’s a great option for anyone looking to save every dollar.</p>
<h3 id="hostgator-review">Hostgator Review</h3>
<p>Best For:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared Hosting</li>
<li>Cheap Hosting Packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Another big name in small business web hosting, and it’s a bit of a mixed bag. While <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HostGator</a> does have an extensive self-serve knowledge base is, it doesn’t offer any sort of email support — just phone and live chat. Be prepared to get on the phone whenever you have a question. Unlike Dreamhost, Hostgator does include support in all it’s plans. If you want a hosting plan that’s cheap and includes hosting, this is the host for you.</p>
<p>HostGator tends to rank highly on tech publications like PCMag, but customer reviews are pretty dreadful: it has only one star on Trustpilot. If you’re interested in trying HostGator, I recommend taking full advantage of the 45-day money-back guarantee and testing out their support thoroughly before committing.</p>
<p>HostGator does offer Windows hosting in addition to Linux, as well as a variety of options to upgrade, including cloud hosting, VPS hosting, managed WordPress, and a dedicated server. Shared hosting plans start at $2.75/month.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a cheap host, you should start by testing Dreamhost first. Then test Hostgator as a comparison and pick the one that you’re happiest with.</p>
<p>But only consider HostGator if you need to keep your hosting bill as low as possible.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you currently have a website or <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-create-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plan to build a website</a>, CSS is definitely a term that you’ve come across. But for those of you who don’t know how to code and don’t have any development experience, it can be a little confusing.</p>
<p>Let me start with the basics.</p>
<p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It’s a stylesheet language that describes the appearance or presentation of a website. Essentially, CSS tells web browsers how each element in an HTML document should be displayed.</p>
<p>Along with JavaScript and HTML, CSS is a crucial component to every web page on the Internet.</p>
<p><span id="more-43896"></span></p>
<p>The main benefit of CSS is the ability to separate website content from the design elements, simply by changing rules in a CSS file.</p>
<p>Before CSS was used, nearly every attribute related to how HTML documents were displayed was written in HTML markup. This means that so many rules had to be repeated throughout the HTML code.</p>
<p>But CSS makes it possible for developers to move that information into a style sheet, which simplifies the HTML.</p>
<p>As a result, the HTML is shorter, lighter, and less prone to errors. It also makes your HTML much easier to maintain.</p>
<p>In this guide, I’ll give you some common use cases for CSS and show you my favorite ways to learn CSS online.</p>
<h3>CSS common uses</h3>
<p>There are lots of different ways to use CSS on your website. But I want to show you some of the more basic and common applications so you can get familiar with how CSS works.</p>
<p>Once you’re able to master these common principles and use cases, you’ll be able to tackle more complex CSS elements in the future.</p>
<h4>Font styling</h4>
<p>You can use CSS to create a font style. Write properties for elements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Font type</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Size</li>
<li>Alignment</li>
<li>Case</li>
<li>Line height</li>
</ul>
<p>CSS can also be used to add effects like underlining and strikethroughs. Let me give you an example to show you how this works.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43897" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CSS-Font-Style.png" alt="CSS Font Style" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CSS-Font-Style.png 1584w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CSS-Font-Style-300x157.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CSS-Font-Style-768x401.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CSS-Font-Style-1024x535.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1584px) 100vw, 1584px" /></p>
<p>Take a look at the three rules I wrote in the style of this CSS. Property A is a normal font style, Property B is an italic font style, and all H1s are red.</p>
<p>Now when you look at the body, you can see that I wrote the HTML to correspond with those properties. Based on this information, you can see how it would appear on the web page, by looking at the right side of the split screen.</p>
<p>With a simple example like this, you may not immediately see the benefits of CSS.</p>
<p>But now try to imagine a document with 30 or 40 H1s. Based on the properties in this example, all of the H1s would automatically be red, without having to add any additional code in the HTML. If I wanted to change them to blue, all I’d have to do is change the CSS, as opposed to individually going through 40 H1s in the document.</p>
<h4>Position properties</h4>
<p>Website layouts can be defined with CSS position properties. You can write rules to specifically indicate the position of certain elements within an HTML document.</p>
<p>Common property values include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static — Elements in order, based on how they appear in the document.</li>
<li>Fixed — Elements are located in a position that’s relative the browsing window.</li>
<li>Absolute — Elements are positioned relative to its first position.</li>
<li>Sticky — Elements are positioned relative to a website user’s scrolling location.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the position property to create website layouts, there will be instances where elements on the page overlap with other items. So there could be potential issues with this approach.</p>
<p>There are other ways to define the position of elements on a page, which we’ll get to next.</p>
<h4>Float properties</h4>
<p>The main usage of the float property is to send an element in HTML to the right or left of another element without changing the flow of the document. This is one of the best approaches to creating layouts for a website.</p>
<p>You’ve definitely seen floats used before when you’re browsing on the web, even if you didn’t know that you were looking at a float.</p>
<p>It’s most commonly used for images. An image can be positioned within a block of text, in a way that doesn’t create separation between the flowing text.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_float" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an example</a> of the float property used for an image.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43899" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Float-Properties.png" alt="Float Properties" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Float-Properties.png 1980w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Float-Properties-300x163.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Float-Properties-768x418.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Float-Properties-1024x558.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1980px) 100vw, 1980px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the CSS property says that images will float right. So in the body of the HTML when an image is entered, the float property is automatically applied.</p>
<p>Floats are also commonly used for creating website menus. Items in the menu are floated in a way so they can appear in a horizontal line, as opposed to a bulleted list.</p>
<h4>Clear properties</h4>
<p>The clear property of CSS is often used to clear the float. As you just learned, when an element gets floated, all of the subsequent elements are adjusted so that they align properly based on the float property.</p>
<p>If you want those subsequent elements to begin below a floated element, as opposed to alongside of it, then you would apply the clear property to start the element on a new line.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visual representation</a> to show you what this would look like for images.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43900" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clear.png" alt="Clear" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clear.png 1194w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clear-300x114.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clear-768x291.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Clear-1024x388.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px" /></p>
<p>The clear property can be applied to other elements as well, but an image like you can see above is definitely one of the more common practices.</p>
<h4>Box model</h4>
<p>Every HTML element can be considered a box. When using CSS, the box model refers to the design and layout of a page.</p>
<p>The best way to describe this model is that there is a box wrapping around every element of HTML. There are three main components to the box model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Margin</li>
<li>Border</li>
<li>Padding</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of how you could write a CSS rule for the box model.</p>
<p>P {</p>
<p>padding: 10px;</p>
<p>border: 20px solid blue;</p>
<p>margin: 20px;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>These CSS properties would translate to 10 pixels of padding on each side of the text. This will be empty space around the paragraph. There would also be a 20 pixel border of solid blue surrounding the padding. Lastly, there would be 20 pixels of margins between the border and any other surrounding element.</p>
<h3>Responsive web design with CSS</h3>
<p>Today, we have hundreds, if not thousands, of different screens available on the market. This means that people who visit your website can be doing so from countless variations of devices, screen sizes, display sizes, and resolutions.</p>
<p>Having a full-size website with just one additional design for a smaller device is no longer an option. So you need to use CSS to create a responsive design.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, there are certain principles that you need to follow to ensure that your CSS is responsive on any screen from any device.</p>
<p>Your entire layout and grid needs to be fluid. You need to make sure that images automatically resize to render aesthetically from any screen.</p>
<p>One of the most popular ways to tackle a responsive web design is with a <a href="https://fredericgonzalo.com/en/2017/03/01/understanding-the-difference-between-mobile-first-adaptive-and-responsive-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile-first approach</a>. This means that the design is made with the smallest screens in mind first, and then styles are added as the size gets larger.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43901" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Responsive-CSS.png" alt="Responsive CSS" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Responsive-CSS.png 1278w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Responsive-CSS-300x203.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Responsive-CSS-768x519.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Responsive-CSS-1024x692.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px" /></p>
<p>There are lots of great benefits to this approach.</p>
<p>A mobile first design forces you to determine the most essential functions of your website. Once those have been identified, you’ll use them as the foundation and building blocks for the site’s design.</p>
<p>More often than not, a full-sized website has additional elements that aren’t viewed on mobile versions of the site. But a mobile-first approach ensures that all of the primary purposes and functions will be at the forefront of the design.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this approach means mobile users won’t have download as many site resources and CSS rules when accessing a website from a mobile device. This will save data usage for the user, create faster loading times, and an overall better user experience.</p>
<h3>CSS learning resources</h3>
<p>Everything I’ve covered so far just barely scratches the surface with CSS. I just wanted to give you an introduction so that you’d have a better understanding of how it works.</p>
<p>But for those of you who want to learn CSS beyond a beginner level, there are some great tools and resources online for you take advantage of. I’ve narrowed down a couple of my favorite options.</p>
<h4>Codecademy</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43902" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Codecademy.png" alt="Codecademy" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Codecademy.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Codecademy-300x105.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Codecademy-768x268.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Codecademy-1024x357.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a> is one of the top platforms for learning to code online. Over the last seven years, more than 45 million people have learned to code with their system.</p>
<p>Nearly 500,000 of those people have taken the CSS course. It takes about 15 hours to complete, and you’ll need to take their introduction to HTML course as a prerequisite. So altogether you’re looking at roughly 22 hours of your time to learn CSS.</p>
<p>Codecademy will teach you how to style web pages with file structures, text edits, colors, and various layouts. You can use these skills to customize your web pages.</p>
<p>The class also covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS selectors</li>
<li>Visual rules</li>
<li>The box model</li>
<li>Displays</li>
<li>Positioning</li>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>CSS grids</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see from this list, some of these subjects we discussed in this guide. So you’ll already have a basic understanding of some principles, which will give you a head start.</p>
<p>You’ll have access to some of these courses for free, but to get the full experience I’d recommend upgrading to the pro version of Codecademy.</p>
<p>Pricing is $19.99 per month for an annual contract, which is the best deal they have. Otherwise, you’d pay $29.99 or $39.99 for a six-month or month-to-month contract, respectively.</p>
<h4>W3Schools</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43903" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/W3Schools.png" alt="W3Schools" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/W3Schools.png 1934w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/W3Schools-300x169.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/W3Schools-768x433.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/W3Schools-1024x577.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1934px) 100vw, 1934px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a> has tons of free coding resources. In fact, I used their free editor twice for examples in this guide. The font styling and the float CSS that I showed you earlier were both written on the W3Schools platform.</p>
<p>I like this resource because it’s very simple and hands on.</p>
<p>First, they explain how a certain function or property works, then they show you an example. After that, they make it easy for you to practice with those examples by making changes to the CSS on your own.</p>
<p>There are more than 300 different CSS examples on the W3Schools site. You can test all of these with their editor.</p>
<p>Take advantage of their CSS templates, CSS exercises, and CSS quizzes as well.</p>
<p>For those of you who have an interest in pursuing web development or web design, you can also get a CSS certificate from W3Schools. Although this is something that you’ll have to pay for.</p>
<p>After you complete the training, you can take a 70 question exam, which you’ll have 70 minutes to complete. If you get 75% of those questions correct, you’ll pass and get a certification. If you get 95% of your answers correct, you’ll have a notation of excellency added to the certificate as well.</p>
<p>The CSS certificate program from W3Schools costs $95.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>CSS is a crucial component of every website. You can use it to simplify your HTML, and ultimately reduce the complexity of your HTML files.</p>
<p>There are tons of different ways that CSS can be used. But as a beginner, I didn’t want to overwhelm you with too much at once.</p>
<p>With that said, the information in this guide is still very useful for anyone who is interested in learning more about CSS, so keep it as a reference for the future.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to take your CSS knowledge to the next level, try out one of the online resources that I mentioned above.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re starting to build your first website, WordPress is inevitably a name that you’ve come across. I’d recommend it to nearly anyone who has any type of website.</p>
<p>But before I get into the reasons why WordPress is so great, I want to clear up any misconceptions about the platform.</p>
<p>What exactly is what WordPress?</p>
<p>You don’t host your website with WordPress. You’ll still need to find a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web hosting provider</a> for that service.</p>
<p>WordPress is a content management system (CMS for short). It’s a robust tool for creating and managing your website. Blogs, business websites, personal sites, and ecommerce stores alike can benefit from using WordPress.</p>
<p>This platform is run online, meaning you don’t need to download any desktop software to use it.</p>
<p>So now that you have a better understanding of what WordPress is and what it does, it’s time to talk about why it’s so great. I’ve come up with 11 reasons why you should be using this platform for your website.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, I’m sure you’ll be convinced that WordPress is the best CMS for you.</p>
<p><span id="more-43826"></span></p>
<h3>1. Reliability</h3>
<p>You don’t want to take any chances when it comes to managing your website. Sometimes, looking at how many people use a platform is the best way to determine its reliability.</p>
<p>According a <a href="https://kinsta.com/wordpress-market-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study from Kinsta</a>, WordPress dominates the CMS market share.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43845" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reliability.png" alt="Reliability" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reliability.png 1420w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reliability-300x162.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reliability-768x414.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reliability-1024x552.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1420px) 100vw, 1420px" /></p>
<p>WordPress controls 60% of the CMS market. Joomla is second on the list, with a percentage that’s 12 times smaller than WordPress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, WordPress powers 34% of all websites worldwide. Numbers like this are simply staggering, to say the least.</p>
<p>If the platform wasn’t reliable, it wouldn’t be so widely used. Big-name sites like TED, TechCrunch, UPS, and CNN all use WordPress.</p>
<p>Each month roughly <a href="https://wordpress.com/activity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70 million new posts</a> are published on WordPress. Those posts generate about 77 million new comments over the same period of time.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that WordPress is used by about one-third of websites across the globe, it’s safe to say that your site will be in good hands if you use it as well.</p>
<h3>2. Great support</h3>
<p>Since WordPress is used by so many people all over the world, there are countless guides, tutorials, and resources that can be found online. You can take advantage of <a href="https://en.forums.wordpress.com/">WordPress forums</a> where you can communicate with others who use the planet’s most popular CMS.</p>
<p>Aside from those options, you can also get help and support directly from the WordPress support team.</p>
<p>If you have a paid WordPress plan, you’ll have access to live chat support 24 hours per day, Monday to Friday. For those of you who have business or ecommerce plans, you can even reach live chat agents on the weekends.</p>
<p>With that said, it’s worth noting that this resource won’t be able to help you any third-party applications that you’re using on your WordPress site.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned before, you can easily find help with this on a community forum or guide on another site. There is definitely no shortage of WordPress “how-to” resources on the Internet.</p>
<h3>3. SEO-friendly</h3>
<p>SEO can make or break the success of your website. So it’s something that you need to start focusing on from the inception of your site.</p>
<p>WordPress makes this easy by having some built-in tools that tell you how SEO-friendly your content is. Although most of you will want to upgrade from the basic SEO tools and install a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress SEO plugin</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in this, <a href="https://yoast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoast SEO</a> will be a top option for you to consider.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43846" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO.png" alt="YoastSEO" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-300x137.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-768x350.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-1024x467.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>This plugin is great because there’s a free version that you can try out to get familiar with how it works. But I strongly recommend getting Yoast SEO Premium.</p>
<p>The paid version of this plugin gives you access to more keywords, phrases, and related terms. It will also automatically monitor your most important pages and send you a notification if too much time has passed between updates.</p>
<p>Upgrading to the premium plugin will give you content insights, internal link suggestions, and an ad-free experience, among dozens of other benefits.</p>
<h3>4. Flexibility</h3>
<p>WordPress can as in-depth and complex or as simple as you want it to be.</p>
<p>You have the option to just use the basic version of the platform to publish blog posts. Or on the other side of the spectrum, you can use it for your business website and add widgets and plugins to add functionality.</p>
<p>Nearly anything that you want to do with your website can be accomplished with WordPress.</p>
<p>Again, you may need to install a plugin or third-party application for that to happen, but the possibilities are still there.</p>
<p>The flexibility of WordPress also applies to the type of people who use it. No, I’m not talking about if you can touch your toes or not. I’m referring to your level of technical experience.</p>
<p>Newbies, developers, and everyone in-between the two can use WordPress. How you use it and what features you want to take advantage of will be completely up to you.</p>
<h3>5. Security</h3>
<p>In general, WordPress is a safe and secure platform. But it doesn’t mean you’re completely vulnerable from malicious attacks, hackers, and malware on your website.</p>
<p>Fortunately, WordPress makes it easy for you to enhance your site’s security with features like password protection for folder contents.</p>
<p>Keeping your WordPress version up to date will also fight off bugs and potential security threats.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to enable an <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSL certificate</a> for your WordPress site. Most of the time you can just get this from your web hosting service.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43847" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SSL.png" alt="SSL" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SSL.png 1092w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SSL-261x300.png 261w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SSL-768x883.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SSL-890x1024.png 890w" sizes="(max-width: 1092px) 100vw, 1092px" /></p>
<p>This is a simple and effective way to enhance your WordPress website security.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are additional steps you can take to beef up your site’s security. I’d recommend installing a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-wordpress-security-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress security plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Adding one of these to your site is like building a moat around your house. Sure, doors might be locked, but the added layer will make it even harder for intruders to penetrate your walls.</p>
<p>You can also take proactive steps by installing a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-wordpress-backup-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress backup plugin</a>.</p>
<p>In the event that your site is somehow compromised, you don’t want to lose all of your content and data. A plugin will make it easy for you to recover your website if something goes wrong.</p>
<h3>6. Simplified content creation</h3>
<p>Starting a new WordPress site is so easy; anyone can do it. You can get everything set up with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>Once your site is live, all you need to do is navigate to the “posts” section of your dashboard menu. From here, you’ll be able to find everything you need to write and publish a new blog post.</p>
<p>You’ll find text editors, formatting tools, and ways to upload media files.</p>
<p>As you’ll quickly learn, the entire content creation process on WordPress is very straightforward. So you won’t have any excuse for lacking in that department.</p>
<p>After your content has been published, you won’t have to jump through hoops to edit it moving forward. All you need to do is search the post and make any changes or updates using the visual editor.</p>
<p>Once those changes have been made, just click on the “save” button and the new version of that content will be live instantly.</p>
<h3>7. REST API</h3>
<p>Most of what we talked about today has been geared toward WordPress beginners. But the platform has plenty of advanced features as well.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer, you’ll be happy to know that WordPress has a <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST API</a>, which allows you to build apps using the platform.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43849" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rest-API.png" alt="Rest API" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rest-API.png 1278w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rest-API-300x285.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rest-API-768x731.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Rest-API-1024x974.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px" /></p>
<p>For example, you could create a custom plugin for a new administrative dashboard experience. Or maybe you want to make changes to the front-end.</p>
<p>With the WordPress REST API, you’re not forced to write apps in PHP. You can use any programming language that has the ability to make HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Even if you have no idea what I’m talking about here, it may be something that you learn or become interested in down the road. Or maybe you’ll eventually work with a developer to create an application.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s nice to know that this is an option at your disposal if you use WordPress.</p>
<h3>8. Optimized for speed</h3>
<p>Slow websites are useless. WordPress knows this, so it has specific features and elements that you can take advantage of that will speed up your website.</p>
<p>For example, you can install a lightweight theme that won’t weigh down your code. You could add a plugin to reduce the size of your image files.</p>
<p>Take advantage of options for Gzip compression, advanced caching, and minifying CSS and JS files.</p>
<p>If you use tools like the examples I just gave, you can drastically reduce your website page loading speed. This will ultimately reduce your bounce rates, improve the user experience, and increase conversions on your WordPress site.</p>
<h3>9. Affordable pricing</h3>
<p>WordPress is open-source and free to use. So you can get away without paying anything if you want.</p>
<p>But if you’re going to do more than just have a basic personal website, you’ll definitely want to upgrade to paid plan. The <a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plan types and pricing</a> are as follows:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43850" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Pricing.png" alt="Wordpress Pricing" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Pricing.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Pricing-300x146.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Pricing-768x373.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Pricing-1024x498.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, you’ve got a wide range of options to choose from.</p>
<p>Including the free version, there are six total subscription options. These range from $3 per month to $45 per month.</p>
<p>If you’re willing to pay for WordPress, I wouldn’t even bother using the blogger or personal plan. I’d go straight to Premium.</p>
<p>For just a few dollars more, the added benefits you’ll get are well worth the price.</p>
<p>But if you want additional features like integration with Google Analytics and custom plugins, you’ll need the business plan, at a minimum.</p>
<p>This relates back to what we discussed earlier in terms of flexibility. WordPress has plans that meet the needs of virtually any type of website. All of which are very affordable. Even the most expensive plan will only cost you $540 per year. But I’m assuming the majority of you will be able to get away with spending significantly less than that.</p>
<h3>10. Multilingual</h3>
<p>WordPress has a global reach. It supports more than 160 languages worldwide. So you’ll be able to create a website to reach your global audience as well.</p>
<p>With that said, it’s worth noting that English is the most popular language used on WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/activity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">71% of all blogs</a> published on the platform are written in English.</p>
<p>But it’s nice knowing that if you want to take advantage of other languages, WordPress makes that easy for you to do.</p>
<h3>11. Simple integrations</h3>
<p>As I’ve mentioned throughout this list, WordPress is compatible with tons of different third-party tools.</p>
<p>In addition to plugins and widgets, you can also integrate things like email marketing software, payment gateways, Google Analytics, and countless other components that you might need to run a fully functional and operational website.</p>
<p>Third-party tools are made with WordPress in mind. Since the CMS platform is so popular, those other companies know that their current and prospective customers might be using it to manage their websites.</p>
<p>So you won’t have to ditch the platforms and resources that you’re familiar with once you build a WordPress site.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>WordPress is the most popular CMS platform in the world</p>
<p>As I’m sure you’ve learned from this guide, that didn’t happen by mistake. It doesn’t matter whether you’re building your first website without any experience, or if you’re a veteran developer—you should be using WordPress for your website.</p>
<p>There really isn’t any other content management system I would recommend as highly as WordPress.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re new to building and managing websites, you need to get yourself familiar with widgets as soon as possible.</p>
<p>What’s a widget?</p>
<p>Simply put, it’s website component that adds features or functionality to your site. Widgets are embedded directly onto your site, but you don’t have to develop or code them on your own.</p>
<p>To install a widget on your website, it’s as simple as copying and pasting some code, which will be provided by the creator of the widget. There will usually be a sufficient set of instructions for how and where to install the code from your widget-provider.</p>
<p>Why do you need widgets on your website?</p>
<p><span id="more-43825"></span></p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Websites can functionally operate without widgets. But I’m sure you’ve landed on websites and wondered how they were able to add so many cool features and functionality to their pages. In many instances, they probably used a widget.</p>
<p>Your website builders and content management systems will be somewhat limited. Widgets fill in all of the blanks that aren’t provided by those platforms.</p>
<p>Widgets come in all shapes and sizes. They range from clocks, to weather feeds, and translators. But depending on the type of website you have, adding a clock or weather icon to your site doesn’t really add much value to your visitors.</p>
<p>That’s what inspired me to write this guide. I’ve come up with a list of the top 10 widgets that add real value and functionality to improve your website.</p>
<h3>1. Reservio</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43851" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reservio.png" alt="Reservio" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reservio.png 1990w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reservio-300x180.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reservio-768x461.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reservio-1024x614.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1990px) 100vw, 1990px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reservio.com/features/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reservio</a> is an online booking widget. So for those of you who run a business that takes appointments, it will enhance the experience of your website visitors.</p>
<p>Adding the Reservio booking button to your site is easier than having to take appointments over the phone. Plus, since all of your bookings can be handled online, your customers can schedule appointments at any time, even outside of your normal business hours.</p>
<p>Reservio syncs with the calendars that you’re already using, like Outlook, iCal, and Google Calendar.</p>
<p>It’s compatible with popular site builders and CMS platforms such as Wix, Webnode, Weebly, and WordPress.</p>
<p>With that said, if you’re a WordPress user and want more than just a widget for scheduling online reservations, you can check out my list of the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-wordpress-booking-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best WordPress booking plugins</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Smartsupp</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43852" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smartsupp.png" alt="Smartsupp" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smartsupp.png 1984w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smartsupp-300x171.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smartsupp-768x437.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Smartsupp-1024x583.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1984px) 100vw, 1984px" /></p>
<p>If you want to drastically enhance the customer service experience on your website, you need to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-provide-better-customer-service-by-implementing-live-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implement live chat</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.smartsupp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smartsupp</a> widget is one of the easiest ways to make this happen.</p>
<p>This is ideal for those of you who are selling online with an ecommerce site. Whether you’re selling products or services, Smartsupp makes it possible for your current and prospective customers to reach you with any questions they have.</p>
<p>Adding personalized communication methods to your website will ultimately increase your conversion rates in the long run.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/live-chat-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study</a>, 77% of consumers won’t buy from sites that don’t offer live chat as a support option.</p>
<p>People that engage with a live chat representative on your website are worth over 4.5 times more than customers who don’t.</p>
<p>Live chat increases average order values by 10%. It also increases conversion rates by 40%.</p>
<p>Response times for live chat are also significantly faster than communication methods like email or phone support. Plus, live chat has the highest consumer satisfaction ratings.</p>
<p>So if you’re ready to add this feature to your website, just install the Smartsupp widget.</p>
<h3>3. Disqus</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43853" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Disqus.png" alt="Disqus" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Disqus.png 1366w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Disqus-300x173.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Disqus-768x444.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Disqus-1024x592.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></p>
<p>The Disqus widget is made for those of you who want to have more engaged website visitors, which is basically everyone.</p>
<p>If you have a blog on your website, it’s a great platform for you to share your thoughts, opinions, and give valuable information to your visitors. But that communication platform shouldn’t be a one-way street.</p>
<p>To increase engagement, you want your customers to share their opinions as well.</p>
<p>Adding Disqus to your site adds functionality to your blog comments. It also gives you added management tools for monitoring and responding to comments.</p>
<p>This widget is super easy to set up. Disqus even includes a <a href="https://disqus.com/admin/blogger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video instruction guide</a> for installing their widget.</p>
<h3>4. AddThis</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43855" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AddThis.png" alt="AddThis" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AddThis.png 884w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AddThis-300x206.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AddThis-768x526.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px" /></p>
<p>You spend a ton of time creating content. But what happens after you publish it to your website?</p>
<p>Sure, in a perfect world all of your site traffic will come organically. But you and I both know that isn’t always the case. It’s crucial for you to find other ways to get people to land on your website.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to do this is by leveraging your existing website visitors. Encourage them to share your content with their friends, family, co-workers, and peers via social media.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. People won’t necessarily go out of their way to do this unless you make it easy for them.</p>
<p>That’s where the <a href="https://www.addthis.com/get/share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AddThis</a> widget comes into play.</p>
<p>You can connect to more than 200 social networks with the share buttons offered by the AddThis widget. All of the buttons are mobile-friendly and fully customizable.</p>
<p>Formatting for the share buttons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating bar</li>
<li>Image sharing</li>
<li>Expanding</li>
<li>Inline</li>
</ul>
<p>These options ensure that no matter what type of website design you have, you’ll be able to seamlessly integrate these share buttons without it feeling too intrusive for your visitors.</p>
<p>Now people can share your content on social media with just one click, which will ultimately increase awareness and drive more traffic to your website.</p>
<h3>5. Survio</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43856" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Survio.png" alt="Survio" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Survio.png 1946w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Survio-300x138.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Survio-768x352.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Survio-1024x469.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1946px) 100vw, 1946px" /></p>
<p>In the past, I’ve explained <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/customer-satisfaction-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to use surveys to make more money for your business</a>.</p>
<p>With widgets like <a href="https://www.survio.com/en/survey-on-your-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survio</a>, this process has become easier than ever before. You can simply create a new survey in just a few minutes and integrate it into your website with the Survio widget.</p>
<p>It’s a clean and professional way to gather more information from your website visitors.</p>
<p>Premium surveys are mobile-friendly, safe, come with email support, and SSL. You’ll also be able to evaluate the responses with real-time results.</p>
<p>They have hundreds of survey templates and examples for you to choose from. Here are just a handful of examples to give you an idea of how extensive the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand awareness</li>
<li>Buying experience</li>
<li>Service cancelation</li>
<li>Tech support</li>
<li>Event planning</li>
<li>Team building</li>
<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Bank</li>
<li>Cafe</li>
<li>Cosmetics and beauty salon</li>
<li>Hotel guest</li>
<li>Shipping service</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on and on. So no matter what type of business or website you have, you’ll be able to find a template that’s suitable for your survey needs.</p>
<h3>6. MailChimp</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43857" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MailChimp.png" alt="MailChimp" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MailChimp.png 1234w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MailChimp-300x148.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MailChimp-768x380.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MailChimp-1024x506.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1234px) 100vw, 1234px" /></p>
<p>Collecting email addresses and <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-grow-your-email-list-as-an-ecommerce-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing your email list</a> needs to be a priority for all websites. This statement holds true for blogs, personal sites, ecommerce companies, SaaS, and really any time of site that you an imagine.</p>
<p>In order to effectively collect emails from website visitors, you need to have signup forms strategically placed throughout your landing pages.</p>
<p>If you’re using MailChimp for email marketing services, then the <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MailChimp signup widget</a> is an absolute must-have for your website.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as copying and pasting the signup form code into your site’s HTML wherever you want the widget to appear.</p>
<p>MailChimp offers four types of forms for you to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic</li>
<li>Condensed</li>
<li>Horizontal</li>
<li>Unstyled</li>
</ul>
<p>After you choose the type of form, you can customize the title, form fields, and enable features like re-CAPTCHA to eliminate spam signups.</p>
<p>These widgets are compatible with platforms like WordPress, Jimdo, Webs, Weebly, Yola, Blogger, and Blogspot.</p>
<h3>7. GetResponse</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43858" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GetResponse.png" alt="GetResponse" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GetResponse.png 1382w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GetResponse-300x162.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GetResponse-768x416.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GetResponse-1024x554.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1382px) 100vw, 1382px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.getresponse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetResponse</a> is another popular marketing software for email. But with that said, it also has features and benefits that go beyond email marketing.</p>
<p>The widgets offered by GetResponse correspond with some of the features that they offer.</p>
<p>For example, they have a standard subscribe widget, similar to the one we just discussed from MailChimp. It’s an effective way to get more email subscribers with an opt-in form.</p>
<p>But GetResponse also has a contact widget, which is used for creating contact forms that are fully customizable.</p>
<p>This is a great way for your website visitors to communicate with you and provide feedback.</p>
<p>In addition to the subscribe and contact widgets, GetResponse also has a survey widget that can be used for a wide range of functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exit surveys</li>
<li>Customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Market research</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use your surveys to collect email addresses. The widget can integrate with other platforms like MailChimp, Mailer, and HubSpot. So they don’t force you to use their email marketing software if you’re already using another provider.</p>
<h3>8. Gumroad</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43859" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Gumroad.png" alt="Gumroad" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Gumroad.png 1482w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Gumroad-300x280.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Gumroad-768x716.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Gumroad-1024x955.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1482px) 100vw, 1482px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://gumroad.com/widgets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gumroad</a> is made for those of you who are using your website to sell a digital product or service.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t recommend it for full-fledged ecommerce sites. In those instances, you’ll definitely want to be using an ecommerce platform.</p>
<p>But for example, if you run a blog and want to sell an ebook, you can easily use the Gumroad widget to make that happen. It’s extremely simple to install.</p>
<p>All I did was type “Buy From Quick Sprout” into the form field and the button automatically changed. Then you can decide if you want to auto-trigger the payment form and allow single-product purchases.</p>
<p>After that, the code is automatically generated based on your settings. Then it’s just a matter of copying and pasting it into your website.</p>
<p>Processing payments with this widget will cost you 3.5% + $0.30 per transaction.</p>
<p>That pricing is actually pretty competitive if you compare it to the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-payment-methods-for-your-ecommerce-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best payment methods for your ecommerce site</a>. But again, if you’re just selling one digital product, you don’t necessarily need to go through all the steps of setting up an ecommerce website.</p>
<p>Just install the Gumroad widget instead.</p>
<h3>9. Swiftype</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43860" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Swiftype.png" alt="Swiftype" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Swiftype.png 1374w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Swiftype-300x182.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Swiftype-768x466.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Swiftype-1024x622.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1374px) 100vw, 1374px" /></p>
<p>How can your website visitors find what they’re looking for? I’m sure you have a menu and sitemap that are easy to follow, but navigating that way isn’t always user-friendly.</p>
<p>Adding a search bar widget like <a href="https://swiftype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiftype</a> is a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Industry giants like CBS, AOL, BMW, AT&amp;T, and Samsung are using this widget to add search functionality to their websites.</p>
<p>The way that this widget works is simple.</p>
<p>All you need to do is enter the address of your website, and Swiftype will index all of the content. Then it will essentially create a real-time search engine that’s specific to everything on your site.</p>
<p>No coding is required to operate this widget. But if you’re a developer, Swiftype has an API available to give you added control.</p>
<p>The widget can autocomplete searches based on what users start typing. It will also refine the search based on things like price, location, date, or type of content.</p>
<p>Swiftype searches are intelligent, so you’ll benefit from spellcheck, stemming, bigram matching, phrase matching, and synonyms. All of this ensures that your website visitors are seeing as many relevant results as possible.</p>
<h3>10. Wufoo</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43861" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wufoo.png" alt="Wufoo" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wufoo.png 1860w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wufoo-300x135.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wufoo-768x345.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wufoo-1024x460.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1860px) 100vw, 1860px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wufoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wufoo</a> is an online form-building widget.</p>
<p>It allows you to create surveys, invitations, contact forms, registrations, and payment information.</p>
<p>All you need to do is create a form using their form builder. Then embed it on your website. Wufoo will email or text you whenever the data from your forms become available. You also have the option to set up real-time analytics.</p>
<p>There are more than 400 form templates for you to choose from. You can also set custom rules and create dynamic visualizations with charts and graphs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Adding a widget to your site can truly take it to the next level.</p>
<p>You can benefit from enhanced functionality and professionalism while improving the user experience simultaneously.</p>
<p>There are more widgets out there than I can count. But these 10 are my favorite. They are flexible, functional, and can be used on a wide range of different websites.</p>
<p>I tried to make sure I included something for everyone on here. So I’m confident that you’ll find the widget that you’re looking for on this list.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an ecommerce store, driving traffic to your website is only half of the battle. That in itself is a tall task, but so much more needs to be done in order for you to actually generate sales.</p>
<p>Take a moment to put yourself into the minds of the consumers.</p>
<p>Clearly, they’re somewhat interested in whatever you’re selling. Maybe they found you from an organic search of a product they need or maybe they clicked on a PPC advertisement. It’s possible that they found your site from a social media campaign.</p>
<p>The way they found you really doesn’t matter. What’s important is that they landed on your site because of interest.</p>
<p>You’ve done a great job of setting up your site navigation, making it easy for visitors to find exactly what they’re looking for. This brings them to the product page, which is what we’ll be focusing on in this guide.</p>
<p><span id="more-43828"></span></p>
<p>Here’s what you need to realize. When a website visitor lands on your product page, they’re often just a click away from completing the purchase process. But that won’t happen if those landing pages aren’t optimized for conversions.</p>
<p>Failure to properly design and optimize product pages is a mistake that I see ecommerce sites make all of the time. That’s what inspired me to write this guide.</p>
<p>I’ll explain everything you need to know about crafting product pages that drive conversions.</p>
<h3>Elements of a product page</h3>
<p>Before we continue, I want to make sure you understand exactly what needs to be included on every product page. All product pages should have the same elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Product</li>
<li>Branding</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Copywriting</li>
</ul>
<p>First and foremost, your product always needs to be the center of attention. While this may seem obvious, I’ve seen some ecommerce sites position their products in a way that appears to be an afterthought.</p>
<p>Branding needs to be everywhere on your website. While you may have branding on your homepage or other interior pages, you can’t forget to add this to your product pages. Depending on where your traffic is coming from, not everyone who lands on a product page will see your homepage.</p>
<p>Website design is one of the most crucial elements of a product page. Even if you include all of the other proper elements, it’s useless if the design isn’t functional or user-friendly.</p>
<p>You can’t sell products without text. That’s why your sales copy is a critical element. The writing needs to flow well with your design and branding to tie everything together.</p>
<p>Now that you know what needs to be on your product pages, let’s look at some more specific tips for product page optimization.</p>
<h3>Make sure your CTA is clear and obvious</h3>
<p>How does someone buy an item from your product page?</p>
<p>They need to click on a button that allows them to check out. But if that button is buried somewhere on the page, you won’t drive as many conversions.</p>
<p>Take a look at this product page from <a href="https://www.blenderseyewear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blenders Eyewear</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43829" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blenders-Eyewear.png" alt="Blenders Eyewear" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blenders-Eyewear.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blenders-Eyewear-300x109.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blenders-Eyewear-768x278.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blenders-Eyewear-1024x370.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>There’s only one button on this entire page that can be clicked—add to cart.</p>
<p>It’s big, bold, and the only text on the screen with a background color.  In fact, aside from the product itself, the CTA here is the most prominent part of the page. It can’t be missed.</p>
<p>Go to your website and look at your product pages. See if your CTA is as clear and obvious as this one.</p>
<p>If your visitors can’t spot the button right away, it’s a problem.</p>
<p>Your CTA must be in view at all times. If users have to scroll to find it, then it’s not going to have a high conversion rate.</p>
<p>Here’s something else to keep in mind. Don’t place your conversion CTA near other CTAs on your site. For example, the “buy now” button shouldn’t be positioned next to a “subscribe” button.</p>
<p>While collecting emails is important, that doesn’t belong above the fold on your product page, and it certainly shouldn’t be somewhere that will draw attention away from your transactional CTA.</p>
<p>Don’t get too cute or fancy with the wording of your call-to-action either. Something along the lines of “buy now” or “add to cart” is just fine. Trying to be creative here can just end up confusing your customers.</p>
<h3>Use professional photography</h3>
<p>Unlike brick and mortar retail, online consumers rely heavily on images to make their buying decisions.</p>
<p>Your smartphone might take a great picture, but you should not be using it to take product photos. Everything needs to be handled by a professional.</p>
<p>Get a photographer to handle photoshoots with professional equipment and editing software. It’s worth it to spend extra on these things in order to get the best shot. You’ll need to take photos from every possible angle.</p>
<p>With that said, you also need to make sure that you’re taking the “right” photos for your product pages.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re selling something like a wristwatch. A photo of a watch alone on a table doesn’t really add much value to the consumer. But if you put it on someone’s wrist, it gives them a better indication of the product will look if they buy it.</p>
<p>Take a look at the images on this product page from <a href="https://www.mvmtwatches.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVMT</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43830" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MVMT.png" alt="MVMT" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MVMT.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MVMT-300x134.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MVMT-768x343.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MVMT-1024x458.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>This is great photography. They used the “right” images because all of the shots show the product on a person’s wrist.</p>
<p>You can see how it looks from every angle. The first image shows how it looks from the first person perspective of the model looking down to check the time. Then it includes some other shots of how it will look from someone else’s view.</p>
<p>Oh yeah—they even show what the watch looks like if you’re jumping out of a plane.</p>
<p>These photos tell the full story about the product. It’s stylish, looks great, and can be worn as casual wear and active wear alike.</p>
<h3>Include social proof</h3>
<p>No matter how independent or unique a person claims to be, consumers will still follow the lead of others. Why should they buy a product if nobody else has?</p>
<p>They’ll have no way of telling if your product is good, useful, or just a waste of their money. If they’re unable to get these questions answered, then they probably won’t buy.</p>
<p>That’s why you need to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/social-proof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include social proof</a> on your product pages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">84% of people</a> trust an online review as much as a recommendation from a friend. After reading between one and six reviews, 68% of customers form an opinion about a brand or product.</p>
<p>It’s your job to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-correctly-manage-customer-testimonials-to-increase-your-brand-credibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encourage customer reviews</a>. After someone makes a purchase, send a follow-up email and ask them to rate or review the product. The more reviews you get, the better off you’ll be.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.bryancaplan.com/blog-posts/top-25-online-review-statistics-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">49% of consumers</a> say that they value the quantity of online reviews when they’re evaluating a business.</p>
<p>Blenders Eyewear, one of the examples we looked at earlier, had reviews on their product page. Just make sure you don’t let the reviews distract the user from buying.</p>
<p>Here’s another example of this strategy used by <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooks</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43831" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brooks.png" alt="Brooks" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brooks.png 1980w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brooks-300x167.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brooks-768x427.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brooks-1024x570.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1980px) 100vw, 1980px" /></p>
<p>This product has 68 reviews and it’s rated 5/5 stars by their customers. You can see this information above the fold, and near the product description.</p>
<p>However, the actual reviews aren’t shown here. If you click on them, it will bring you to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43833" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reviews.png" alt="Reviews" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reviews.png 1314w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reviews-300x268.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reviews-768x686.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Reviews-1024x915.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1314px) 100vw, 1314px" /></p>
<p>That’s where the reviews belong.</p>
<p>If these were positioned elsewhere on the page, it would be too distracting and take away from the product and CTA. But by including some information above the fold, and giving customers easy access to find the reviews and read them, it helps aid their buying decision.</p>
<p>Visitors can do all of this without having to go to another landing page or third-party review sites.</p>
<h3>Add videos</h3>
<p>If a picture is worth 1,000 words, how much is a video worth?</p>
<p>Earlier I explained the importance of allowing your customers to get a better understanding of your products with images. But a video really gives them a closer look at everything.</p>
<p>Videos can showcase your products more than a picture ever could.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.renderforest.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90% of people</a> say that product videos are helpful during the buying process. 70% of marketers say that videos convert higher than any other type of content.</p>
<p>After watching a video, 64% of consumers are more likely to buy a product.</p>
<p>Check out this example of a product page from <a href="https://gopro.com/en/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoPro</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43834" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GoPro.png" alt="GoPro" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GoPro.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GoPro-300x161.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GoPro-768x413.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GoPro-1024x551.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>It’s a different approach compared to some of the other examples we’ve looked at so far.</p>
<p>Videos are especially important for this company since they’re selling a camera on this page. The video shows exactly what type of content can be captured with this camera.</p>
<p>Videos are great for those of you who have products that need a little bit more explanation. It’s not necessarily required if you’re selling something simple, like a plain shirt.</p>
<p>But with that said, you can still include videos, even if you’re selling something straightforward. <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allbirds</a> is a shoe company that has videos on their product pages of people walking in their shoes.</p>
<p>For those of you that have a product that’s a bit more complex and requires further explanation, adding a “how to” video or product demonstration can be very helpful to the consumer.</p>
<h3>Carefully craft product descriptions</h3>
<p>This is one of the more common mistakes that I see on ecommerce product pages. Everything looks great until the description.</p>
<p>While your product page should definitely be visually appealing with photos and videos, you still need to have some text on the page.</p>
<p>Keep it short. Don’t go overboard with long paragraphs. Nobody wants to read large blocks of text. You can use bullet points to shorten the content and make it easier for people to read.</p>
<p>Don’t be boring. Establish a brand voice. Know your audience and what they want to hear.</p>
<p>If your target market is business professionals over the age of 50, the description would be different then if you were trying to reach college students.</p>
<p>Look at this product description from <a href="https://drsquatch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Squatch</a>, an ecommerce site that sells men’s soap.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43835" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dr-Squatch.png" alt="Dr Squatch" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dr-Squatch.png 1394w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dr-Squatch-300x154.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dr-Squatch-768x394.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dr-Squatch-1024x526.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1394px) 100vw, 1394px" /></p>
<p>This particular bar of soap was inspired by the scent of beer.</p>
<p>Take a closer look at some of the text in this description. They use phrasing like “drag a lawn chair into the shower” and “sip a couple cold cruisers.”</p>
<p>Their product isn’t for everyone. So they’re comfortable using slang to target a specific market.</p>
<p>Normally, I’d say steer clear of this type of phrasing. But in this case, it’s part of the company’s overall branding strategy.</p>
<p>Understand your customer and what they want in a product. Then work that into the description.</p>
<p>Don’t just rush through the process and say “soap that smells like beer.” Does this describe the product? Sure.</p>
<p>But will it make anyone want to buy it? Probably not.</p>
<h3>Justify your pricing</h3>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-generate-more-profits-by-focusing-on-your-pricing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pricing strategy</a> is part of your product page since the price will obviously need to be on display.</p>
<p>This is your chance to justify your pricing and show your product’s value.</p>
<p>The description, pictures, videos, and everything else on the page needs to explain exactly why your product is priced a certain way. This is especially true for those of you who are selling products at higher price points.</p>
<p>Look at this example from <a href="https://shop.lululemon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lululemon</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43836" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lululemon.png" alt="Lululemon" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lululemon.png 1966w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lululemon-300x111.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lululemon-768x285.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lululemon-1024x380.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1966px) 100vw, 1966px" /></p>
<p>They have a quick “why we made this” description directly under the price.</p>
<p>In short, it explains that the product doesn’t have seams, is made with anti-stink technology, is ventilated, and made for training.</p>
<p>It’s not just a regular t-shirt for wearing to bed or around the house. So the high price tag of $68 for a seemingly simple shirt is justifiable.</p>
<p>Without that information, consumers may be a bit more reluctant to buy.</p>
<h3>A/B test everything</h3>
<p>Truthfully, you won’t know for sure if your product page is fully optimized until you try different approaches.</p>
<p>That’s why every element of the page should be A/B tested over and over again.</p>
<ul>
<li>CTA wording</li>
<li>CTA placement</li>
<li>CTA color</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Review placement</li>
<li>Price placement</li>
<li>Price size</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on and on. It’s an ongoing process.</p>
<p>Even as your conversion rates rise, don’t assume that they can’t get any higher. Keep running tests to be sure.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Product pages are the most important components of your ecommerce site.</p>
<p>When a website visitor lands on one of these pages, they are moments away from converting. It’s your job to make sure that every product page is optimized to drive sales.</p>
<p>Use this guide as a reference to help you make sure that your pages have all of the crucial elements needed. Then follow the examples that I showed you and apply those same principles to your website.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike some of the other <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web hosting providers</a> on the market, iPage isn’t as well-known. But the company has been around for more than 20 years and hosts over one million websites with its two data centers.</p>
<p>If you stumbled upon <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10195/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPage</a> for web hosting, it’s probably because you were looking for an inexpensive hosting plan.</p>
<p>With hosting plans offered as low as $1.99 per month, that’s the major draw for this web host.</p>
<p>But the cheapest web host on the market isn’t always the best—or is it? That’s what inspired me to write this guide.</p>
<p>I’ve been getting lots of questions lately about my opinion on iPage. How does its low-cost factor into its performance?</p>
<p>For those of you who are looking for a budget web host, iPage might be an option for you to consider. But before you make that decision, read through this review to make sure you have as much information as possible.</p>
<p><span id="more-43827"></span></p>
<h3>iPage Web Hosting Plans</h3>
<p>Before we talk about the pros, cons, and performance of iPage, I want to give you a brief overview of the plans that they offer. For a low-cost web host, they actually have quite a few options for you to choose from.</p>
<h4>Shared hosting</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43837" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Web-Hosting.png" alt="iPage Web Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Web-Hosting.png 1884w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Web-Hosting-300x79.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Web-Hosting-768x201.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Web-Hosting-1024x269.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1884px) 100vw, 1884px" /></p>
<p>Like most web hosts, the shared hosting plan from iPage is the least expensive option.</p>
<p>But what’s unique about this web host compared to other providers on the market is the lack of shared hosting plan options. Typically, web hosts offer at least two or three different pricing tiers for shared hosting, each with different features and benefits.</p>
<p>iPage, on the other hand, just has this one plan.</p>
<p>If you decide to use iPage’s shared hosting service, you’ll also get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free domain</li>
<li>Free SSL certificate</li>
<li>Free email addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>You can host an unlimited number of domains on the shared plan as well.</p>
<p>Pricing starts at $1.99 per month if you sign up for a three-year contract. Rates for a two-year contract and one-year contract start at $2.49 per month and $2.99 per month, respectively.</p>
<h4>VPS hosting</h4>
<p>If you’re interested in a virtual private server, iPage has what you’re looking for. Unlike the shared plan, VPS hosting with iPage does come with different pricing tiers and plan options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic VPS</li>
<li>Business VPS</li>
<li>Optimum VPS</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a comparison of those three plans.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43838" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-VPS-Hosting-Plans.png" alt="iPage VPS Hosting Plans" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-VPS-Hosting-Plans.png 1694w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-VPS-Hosting-Plans-300x245.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-VPS-Hosting-Plans-768x628.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-VPS-Hosting-Plans-1024x838.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1694px) 100vw, 1694px" /></p>
<p>As expected, the more you pay, the more features you’ll get. CPU, RAM, disk space, and bandwidth increases at each tier.</p>
<p>While iPage has a reputation for being a low-cost web hosting provider, their VPS plans are not necessarily cheaper than other web hosts on the market. Their VPS services are priced about even to or higher than some other well-known hosting providers.</p>
<p>All of the pricing you see from the image above is the introductory offer for a three-year plan. Rates will increase when your plan renews and if you commit to a shorter term contract length.</p>
<p>With a VPS plan, you’ll have more customizable options. iPage will give you root access and the ability to customize your software and hosting environment.</p>
<h4>Dedicated servers</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43840" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Dedicated-Hosting.png" alt="iPage Dedicated Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Dedicated-Hosting.png 1970w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Dedicated-Hosting-300x76.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Dedicated-Hosting-768x195.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Dedicated-Hosting-1024x260.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1970px) 100vw, 1970px" /></p>
<p>The dedicated servers from iPage are a step above the VPS plans. You can get up to 16GB of RAM, 1,000 GB of disk space, 15 TB, of bandwidth, and 5 IP addresses with a dedicated server</p>
<p>Introductory rates for a three-year contract are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup — $119.99 per month</li>
<li>Professional — $151.99 per month</li>
<li>Enterprise — $191.99 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>Those plans renew at $149.99, $194.99, and $239.99. Again, for a budget web host, I wouldn’t necessarily say that those price points are cheap.</p>
<p>But the dedicated servers give you complete customization. There are no restrictions to your software and hosting environment, these plans were made for those of you with more technical skill levels.</p>
<p>You won’t be sharing any resources with other websites if you use a dedicated server from iPage.</p>
<h4>WordPress hosting</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43841" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Wordpress-Hosting.png" alt="iPage WordPress Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Wordpress-Hosting.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Wordpress-Hosting-300x71.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Wordpress-Hosting-768x182.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Wordpress-Hosting-1024x243.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>iPage offers <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web hosting solutions specifically for WordPress</a>. If you want to start building a new WordPress website, there are two plans for you to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>WP Starter — $3.75 per month</li>
<li>WP Essential — $6.95 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>These rates are definitely more aligned with iPage’s reputation of being a low-cost web hosting provider.</p>
<p>Both plans come with unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, customized control panel, as well as some pre-installed themes and plugins. The WP Essential plan also has automatic malware removal, added security, and expert WordPress support.</p>
<p>The rates renew at $7.49 and $10.49 per month.</p>
<h3>Benefits of iPage for web hosting</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve had a chance to review the hosting options offered by iPage, it’s time for us to look at the best parts of this web host.</p>
<h4>Low pricing</h4>
<p>Based on the plans we’ve covered, you can see that iPage has a wide range of options to choose from. There are some budget hosting solutions, as well as some higher-end offers with added features and functionality.</p>
<p>But ultimately, iPage is best-known for its low pricing. With shared plans offered as low as $1.99 per month, it’s very appealing to new website owners who are on a budget.</p>
<p>The only drawback of this low pricing is that you need to commit for three years and pay for it upfront to get that rate. Unlike other web hosts on the market, iPage does not offer month-to-month plans.</p>
<h4>Money-back guarantee</h4>
<p>While iPage doesn’t offer free trials or month-to-month rates, the provider still stands behind their services. All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>It’s a “no questions asked” policy. If you’re unsatisfied for any reason, iPage will fully refund your hosting fees.</p>
<p>However, there is a non-refundable $15 fee if you registered your domain with iPage. They set this up to ensure that you won’t lose your domain if you want to transfer it to another provider.</p>
<p>I usually wouldn’t recommend a hosting provider that doesn’t offer some type of money-back promise. So the fact that iPage does this for their customers is definitely a positive. You can try them out knowing that you have a month to change your mind.</p>
<h4>High uptime</h4>
<p>At the end of the day, performance is really what matters the most. If your web host can’t keep your website up and running, then it’s essentially useless.</p>
<p>So, how well do iPage’s low-cost plans perform? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Hosting Facts conducted a study on the performance of 32 different web hosts. They calculated the <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/average-hosting-uptime-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average uptime rates</a> for each host throughout the course of one year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43842" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Uptime.png" alt="iPage Uptime" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Uptime.png 1434w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Uptime-300x187.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Uptime-768x479.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Uptime-1024x638.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1434px) 100vw, 1434px" /></p>
<p>As you can see from the chart, iPage cracked the top 10, ranking eighth out of the 32 web hosts in the study. The average uptime rate of 99.975% in 2018 was good enough to land this provider in the top 25% of web hosts.</p>
<p>Overall, that’s a very strong uptime. I’d definitely be happy with that number, especially considering the fact that it’s achievable at such a low cost.</p>
<p>With that said, the length of their downtime was nearly triple the amount of the top host on the list. But I truthfully wasn’t expecting iPage to compete with those figures.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that unlike other web hosts, iPage doesn’t guarantee a certain uptime rate. So if they fail to meet a certain standard, you won’t be refunded or compensated in any way. However, they do offer uptime monitoring, so you’ll be notified if your site goes down.</p>
<h4>Third-party tools</h4>
<p>iPage is compatible with lots of third party tools and platforms. Here’s a list to name a few.</p>
<p><b>CMS tools:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>Drupal</li>
<li>Joomla</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Forum tools:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Gbook</li>
<li>phpBB</li>
<li>SMF</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Blogging tools:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>PixelPost</li>
<li>B2evolution</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Photo gallery tools:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>ZenPhoto</li>
<li>Gallery2</li>
</ul>
<p>iPage is also compatible with ecommerce solutions like Zen Cart, OpenCart, PrestaShop, AgoraCart, TomatoCart, and OSCommerce.</p>
<h4>Helpful support</h4>
<p>We already talked about the money-back guarantee. But beyond that, iPage also offers 24/7 phone and live chat support.</p>
<p>They also have an extensive knowledge base, with informative guides, tutorials, and lots of other helpful information about their platform, tools, and services.</p>
<p>So no matter what type of question you have or problem you run into, I’m confident that you’ll be able to get that solution resolved quickly and efficiently with iPage support.</p>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>As expected with a low-cost web hosting provider, iPage has its fair share of flaws. I’ll let you know about some of the downsides of using their services. You can use this information to see if these drawbacks are worth the low price.</p>
<h4>Loading speed isn’t ideal</h4>
<p>Again, performance is key when it comes to web hosting. Aside from uptime, which we already discussed, loading speed usually the next metric that we look at.</p>
<p>Check out the response times for an <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/zp1kq4gopbjs/1631501/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPage test site</a> over the past 12 months.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43843" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Load-Times.png" alt="iPage Load Times" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Load-Times.png 1780w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Load-Times-300x204.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Load-Times-768x523.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Load-Times-1024x697.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1780px) 100vw, 1780px" /></p>
<p>The average response time from this sample is 755 ms.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s not terrible. But this number is a little too close to a full second page loading time for my liking.</p>
<p>Plus, this is just a test website. If you’re going to be adding pictures, video, and other media files to your site, it will slow down even more.</p>
<p>While iPage definitely doesn’t have the worst loading times we’ve seen, they certainly don’t have the best either.</p>
<h4>Not a “green” web host</h4>
<p>This may not be a big deal for some of you, but I figured it was still worth mentioning.</p>
<p>iPage used to have environmentally-friendly web hosting. They had a landing page explaining that they ran on wind power and had a certified green certificate. However, as of late last year, this page has been removed from their website. I tried to Google it and got a 404 error instead.</p>
<p>The web host no longer appears on the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/green-power-partner-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPA Green Power Partner List</a> either.</p>
<h4>Extra fees for add-ons</h4>
<p>iPage is a low-cost web hosting provider. I think it’s safe to say that we established that. However, their services end up costing more than you might think.</p>
<p>Even if you choose the lowest plan of $1.99 per month for three years, you’ll still have to pay extra for things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain privacy</li>
<li>Website security</li>
<li>Site backup and restore</li>
<li>Website builder</li>
</ul>
<p>These are things that usually come free with other hosting providers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43844" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Addons.png" alt="iPage Addons" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Addons.png 1936w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Addons-300x214.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Addons-768x547.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iPage-Addons-1024x729.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1936px) 100vw, 1936px" /></p>
<p>So in your head, you might be thinking $2 per month for 36 months is just $72. Not a bad deal, right?</p>
<p>But as you can see from this checkout page, you’ll end up paying significantly more than that amount for some pretty basic features.</p>
<h4>Paid site migrations</h4>
<p>To entice customers to switch providers, most web hosts will offer a free site migration. But iPage doesn’t do that for new customers.</p>
<p>It will cost you $150 for their tech support to move your site to iPage servers. That cost only covers one website, which is expensive. To put that into perspective for you, <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/professional-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost</a> also charges $150 for site migratations, but they’ll move up to five sites for that same rate.</p>
<p>Unless you’re a tech wizard, you probably don’t want to try and migrate your website on your own. So this is another cost that you’ll have to incur.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Do I recommend <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10195/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPage</a> for web hosting?</p>
<p>In short, yes. They have low-cost shared hosting plans, as well as options for VPS, dedicated servers, and WordPress hosting.</p>
<p>Just be aware that those advertised rates have some conditions attached to them. You’ll need to commit for three years to get the best price, and then your rates will go up when it’s time to renew. Plus, you’ll need to pay extra for all of your add-ons.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, iPage is still a reputable and reliable web host with high uptime rates and great customer support.</p>
<p>For those of you who are on a budget but still aren’t sold on iPage, check out my list of the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-cheap-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best cheap web hosting services</a> for some alternative solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than <a href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">500 websites</a> are being built on WordPress every day. This platform powers 14.7% of the top 100 websites across the globe.</p>
<p>On average, 17 new posts get published on WordPress every second. In a month, WordPress is searched on Google more than 37 million times.</p>
<p>WordPress is a powerful CMS. More than 19.5 million sites across the world use the platform.</p>
<p>So for those of you who are new to the growing WordPress network, welcome to the club. <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-create-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launching a new website</a> can be intimidating if it’s your first time. But if you can quickly learn some tips and tricks on WordPress, it will make your life much easier.</p>
<p>Some of you may have been using WordPress for a while. Others might have had some failed sites and need some guidance moving forward.</p>
<p>Regardless of your situation, this guide will help you succeed.</p>
<p><span id="more-43823"></span></p>
<p>While I definitely wrote the guide with WordPress beginners in mind, some of these tips are being overlooked by people who have been using WordPress for years.</p>
<h3>1. Find the right web hosting plan</h3>
<p>WordPress is an open-source CMS (content management system). Simply put, it’s a tool for creating and managing websites. You can use WordPress to build a personal blog, business website, ecommerce store, or anything in between.</p>
<p>But the platform itself does not host websites. This is a common misconception that I find with prospective website owners.</p>
<p>WordPress recommends three different web hosting options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.siteground.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, you can use any web hosting provider that meets the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress minimum hosting requirements</a>. Basically, your host needs to have a PHP version of 7.3 or higher. It needs a MySQL version of 5.6 or higher or MariaDB version 10.1 or higher. Your host also needs HTTPS support.</p>
<p>When it comes to web hosting, there are lots of different options to choose from. After you find the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best web hosting provider</a>, you’ll also have to determine the type of hosting you need. Shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated servers, and cloud hosting are the most popular options.</p>
<p>Choosing the right plan and host from the beginning is crucial. It’s important that you find a plan that gives you enough resources to meet your traffic needs.</p>
<p>Picking the wrong hosting plan can end up causing slow loading times, crashes, and downtimes. Plus, changing hosts down the road can be a pain.</p>
<h3>2. Pick a quality theme</h3>
<p>The options are seemingly endless when it comes to picking a WordPress theme. You can browse for options from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress theme directory</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43870" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Themes.png" alt="Wordpress Themes" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Themes.png 1922w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Themes-300x184.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Themes-768x470.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Themes-1024x627.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px" /></p>
<p>However, too many people make the mistake of rushing when they pick a theme. That’s not going to benefit you at all.</p>
<p>There are tens of thousands of themes out there. Not all of them are offered directly from the WordPress theme directory.</p>
<p>Resources like <a href="https://themeforest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThemeForest</a> have nearly 46,000 themes to choose from. In order to get a quality theme, you might have to pay. It’s not a huge expense, and most themes are reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Your theme should also be based on the type of website you have. For example, the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-wordpress-themes-for-blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best WordPress themes for blogs</a> will be different than the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-ecommerce-wordpress-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best ecommerce WordPress themes</a>.</p>
<p>That’s why you should always look at the live demos of themes. It will give you a chance to try a theme out before you install it. This way you’ll be able to get a better idea of the look and feel of a theme from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>It should go without saying, but you need to make sure that any theme you install is mobile-responsive. Themes are useless if they can’t be displayed properly on mobile devices.</p>
<h3>3. Use Google Analytics</h3>
<p>It’s impossible to know how well your site is doing unless you can measure its performance metrics. WordPress alone won’t give you enough information.</p>
<p>But by installing a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-google-analytics-plugins-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics plugin</a>, you’ll be able to get added insight into how site visitors are behaving on your pages.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MonsterInsights</a> is a top option to consider for this.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43871" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MonsterInsights.png" alt="MonsterInsights" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MonsterInsights.png 1772w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MonsterInsights-300x163.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MonsterInsights-768x418.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MonsterInsights-1024x557.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1772px) 100vw, 1772px" /></p>
<p>The plugin has more than 2 million active installations. It’s definitely the most popular Google Analytics plugin on the market today.</p>
<p>After installing this, you’ll have access to audience reports, behavior reports, content reports, and ecommerce reports (if applicable).</p>
<p>The best part about using a Google Analytics plugin is that you’ll be able to view all of your data directly on your WordPress admin dashboard. It’s better than having to bounce around between multiple sites and platforms to access this information.</p>
<h3>4. Install a plugin for SEO</h3>
<p>In addition to Google Analytics, you’ll also want to use a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress SEO plugin</a>. There are hundreds of options out there, but I personally recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoast SEO</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43872" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-1.png" alt="YoastSEO" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-1.png 1660w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-1-300x162.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-1-768x415.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/YoastSEO-1-1024x554.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1660px) 100vw, 1660px" /></p>
<p>Without a proper SEO strategy, your WordPress site won’t get much organic traffic. This is crucial for survival in today’s day and age.</p>
<p>You can’t just assume that your content alone is good enough to bring people to your site. I don’t care what type of website you have or what industry you’re in, SEO needs to be a top priority.</p>
<p>A plugin like this makes things easier for you whenever you want to optimize your site for SEO.</p>
<p>It will analyze keywords and content to ensure that you’re taking the right approach. Yoast also helps you handle the technical side of SEO, like managing your sitemaps or robots.txt files.</p>
<h3>5. Don’t use too many plugins</h3>
<p>I know this may sound contradictory to my last two tips, but you need to limit your use of plugins.</p>
<p>Google Analytics and SEO plugins are definitely necessary, as with some other plugins to add functionality to your website. There are great plugins for things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Directories</li>
<li>Bookings</li>
<li>Memberships</li>
<li>Popups</li>
<li>Backups</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul>
<p>But with that said, you don’t need a plugin for every category. If you’re not going to actually add popups to your website, you don’t need a popup plugin. Don’t install a bookings plugin unless you run a business that would benefit from it.</p>
<p>Installing too many WordPress plugins can ultimately make your site slower. Adding the extra code associated with a plugin can weigh down your website.</p>
<p>More plugins don’t necessarily translate to a better or more functional website. So just don’t go overboard when you’re installing them. Limit plugins to ones that you’ll actually need and use.</p>
<h3>6. Compress images</h3>
<p>Like excess plugins, images are another way to slow your website down. But that doesn’t mean you should shy away from using lots of images in your content.</p>
<p>In fact, I encourage you to use as many images as possible, all over your website. Incorporate them into your blog posts, use them on landing pages, add them to product pages and descriptions as well.</p>
<p>There aren’t many circumstances where I would say an image doesn’t belong on your site.</p>
<p>But with that said, these media files are large, and result in slower loading times. That’s why every image should be compressed before it’s published.</p>
<p>I’d recommend using a tool like the <a href="https://kraken.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kraken Image Optimizer</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43874" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kraken.png" alt="Kraken" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kraken.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kraken-300x177.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kraken-768x453.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kraken-1024x603.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>As you can see from this example, Kraken reduced this file size by 61%. I like this tool because you can handle all of your image compression on the web, without forcing you to download any software.</p>
<p>If you’d rather do this in WordPress, you’ll need to install a plugin.</p>
<h3>7. Modify your permalinks</h3>
<p>Are you familiar with permalinks?</p>
<p>This is the part of the web address that comes after the domain name. These are the web addresses of each individual landing page and blog post.</p>
<p>Each time you create a new page or post on WordPress, it automatically generates a new permalink by default. However, these defaults need to be changed before you publish the page.</p>
<p>A carefully crafted and custom permalink is very valuable. It gives your website visitors an understanding of what the page is about, without having to read the content.</p>
<p>They keep everything organized, and can be used by search engines and site visitors alike for accessing content.</p>
<p>To modify your permalinks, navigate to the “Settings” option from your dashboard. From here you’ll see a “Permalinks” button. The “Post Name” option is the one that will provide the most SEO value, so that’s what you should go with.</p>
<h3>8. Prioritize safety</h3>
<p>We discussed the popularity of WordPress earlier. Since it’s so common for websites to use this platform, it’s also common for hackers to target WordPress sites.</p>
<p>You need to update your WordPress version whenever a new one comes out. This will help you avoid some bugs and hackers. But that alone won’t be enough to keep your site secure.</p>
<p>There are other steps you can take to beef up the security of your WordPress site.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do is get an SSL certificate. This will encrypt information on your site, including sensitive details like customer data. The best web hosting services (like the ones we mentioned earlier) will usually include an SSL certificate.</p>
<p>You should also be backing up your site on a regular basis. If something goes wrong and your content gets lost, you don’t want to be forced to start over from scratch. There are plugins you can install for backups, as well as plugins made for enhancing your site’s security.</p>
<h3>9. Learn how to use heading tags and meta tags</h3>
<p>These are meta tags that appear in SERPs.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve seen them before.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43875" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tags.png" alt="Tags" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tags.png 1400w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tags-300x106.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tags-768x272.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tags-1024x363.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px" /></p>
<p>Heading tags get used within your content. For example, this blog post that you’re reading right now has 12 tags. There’s a title tag at the top, a heading for each of the 10 tips, and a conclusion tag at the bottom.</p>
<p>Both meta tags and title tags have SEO benefits. They also make it content easier for website visitors to consume content.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to read this post without these headers? It would not be as easy.</p>
<p>Based on which type of header is used, it ranks the tag’s significance on the page. The size of the text will change based on this as well. For example, H1 tags are the biggest and most important, while an H6 tag is smaller and less important.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with how these work, just review my guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-use-heading-tags-to-get-more-search-engine-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to use heading tags to get more search engine traffic</a>. I also wrote a guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-craft-meta-tags-for-seo-and-ctr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to craft meta tags for SEO and CTR</a>.</p>
<p>Both of these are valuable resources for your WordPress SEO strategy.</p>
<h3>10. Eliminate clutter</h3>
<p>WordPress gives you tons of customizable options for your website. You have the option to include ads, banners, and widgets all over your page.</p>
<p>However, all of these extras just add clutter to your website. This makes your page looks untrustworthy and unprofessional.</p>
<p>Adding too many elements to your website is also very distracting to your website visitors. It makes it hard for them to focus, which means your content won’t get consumed and they won’t click on your CTAs.</p>
<p>While it might be tempting to take advantage of everything that WordPress has to offer, in some instances, less is definitely more.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>WordPress is one of the best content management systems on the market today. It’s easy to use, and extremely versatile for nearly every type of website.</p>
<p>However, WordPress isn’t really a set it and forget it platform. You’ll still need to actively manage your website.</p>
<p>With so many different features, functions, and add-ons to take advantage of, it can be a bit overwhelming at times. But don’t let yourself get distracted. If you follow these 10 simple WordPress tips that I’ve outlined above, your site performance will improve.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DreamHost has been around for nearly two decades. More than 1.5 million websites are hosted by this provider.</p>
<p>They have over 400,000 customers, and more than 750,000 WordPress installations throughout 100+ countries worldwide.</p>
<p>These figures alone show that <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10194/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost</a> is definitely a top player in the web hosting industry.</p>
<p>But how good is their web hosting service? Like most providers, DreamHost offers a wide range of web hosting types, plans, and services.</p>
<p>I’ll give you an in-depth analysis of everything they offer, so you have enough information to decide if DreamHost is the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best web hosting service for your website</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-43824"></span></p>
<h3>DreamHost Web Hosting Plans</h3>
<p>Compared to other web hosting providers, DreamHost definitely has one of the most extensive lists of hosting options to choose from. They offer a wide range of hosting types and price points to meet the needs of nearly any website.</p>
<h4>Shared hosting</h4>
<p>DreamHost has two tiers of shared hosting plans; Starter and Unlimited. They offer three-year, one-year, and month-to-month contracts for each plan. Although the longer you commit, the less expensive your rate will be.</p>
<p>Pricing for the Starter plan starts at $2.59, $3.95, and $4.95 per month, depending on the length of your contract terms. The Unlimited plan goes for $5.95, $6.95, or $10.95 per month.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43862" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Shared-Hosting.png" alt="DreamHost Shared Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Shared-Hosting.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Shared-Hosting-300x108.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Shared-Hosting-768x277.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Shared-Hosting-1024x369.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>As the name implies, the Stater package is made for new websites that are just starting out.</p>
<p>The Unlimited plan doesn’t have a cap on how many websites you can host. It also comes with free email for your domain, which is a paid add-on with the Starter plan.</p>
<p>Both of these shared plans are best for beginners who are on a tight budget.</p>
<h4>VPS hosting</h4>
<p>The virtual private server plans offered by DreamHost are definitely a step up from the shared options. You’ll benefit from managed performance, along with enhanced security and updates.</p>
<p>A VPS from DreamHost gives your website its own server resources, which speeds up the loading times.</p>
<p>As your website grows, your VPS plan allows you to upgrade your storage and RAM in less than 10 seconds. It’s extremely easy for anyone to set up, regardless of your technical skill level.</p>
<p>All VPS plans are managed, meaning you won’t have to worry about dealing directly with any servers. This is fully handled by the support and operational teams at DreamHost.</p>
<p>The VPS hosting options also support reseller and sub accounts for those of you who plan to manage websites for your clients.</p>
<p>There are four different tiers of VPS pricing from DreamHost. Here’s a comparison of all four.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43863" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-VPS-Hosting.png" alt="Dreamhost VPS Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-VPS-Hosting.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-VPS-Hosting-300x143.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-VPS-Hosting-768x366.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-VPS-Hosting-1024x488.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, they have plans that support a wide range of website types and business needs. All of the pricing shown above is for three-year contracts.</p>
<p>The price per month will increase if you go with a one-year contract or month-to-month plan.</p>
<h3>Dedicated hosting</h3>
<p>DreamHost’s dedicated servers can be rented annually or month-to-month. Unlike the shared and VPS plans, they don’t offer three-year contracts for dedicated hosting.</p>
<p>With that said, the dedicated hosting plans provide the most extensive and customizable options.</p>
<p>Plans are segmented into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard</li>
<li>Enhanced</li>
</ul>
<p>But within each category, you can choose how much RAM and disk space you want.</p>
<p>The Standard plan has three options, and the enhanced plan has six options. So overall, you can choose between nine different plans for your dedicated server.</p>
<p>As expected, price increases as you add storage. Rates range from $149 per month to $379 per month for annual contracts.</p>
<p>The dedicated servers from DreamHost are for those of you who want complete control. You’ll have full root access, and the ability to fully manage your websites, email addresses, and domains.</p>
<h4>Cloud hosting</h4>
<p>DreamCompute is the cloud hosting service offered by DreamHost. It’s a great choice for those of you who want more control, without the added cost.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting gives you the ability to change your settings on-demand. This highly benefits people with growing websites that see traffic spikes.</p>
<p>The best part about this plan is that the pricing is flexible.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43864" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Cloud-Hosting.png" alt="Dreamhost Cloud- Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Cloud-Hosting.png 1976w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Cloud-Hosting-300x177.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Cloud-Hosting-768x452.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Cloud-Hosting-1024x603.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1976px) 100vw, 1976px" /></p>
<p>Unlike every other plan we’ve seen so far offered by DreamHost, the cloud hosting is not billed at a fixed monthly rate.</p>
<p>Instead, they have a maximum amount that you’ll get billed per month, depending on the size of the server you choose. But you only get charged for what you actually use.</p>
<p>Flexible pricing is definitely one of the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/benefits-of-cloud-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top benefits of cloud hosting</a> in general. Not every web hosting provider offers cloud hosting plans, so it’s nice to see that a reputable company like DreamHost has this option for its customers.</p>
<h4>WordPress hosting</h4>
<p>DreamHost has <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plans that are specifically intended for WordPress users</a> as well. Considering that more than 30% of the entire Internet is powered by WordPress, it’s a great option to have if you’re using this CMS.</p>
<p>Along with BlueHost and SiteGround, DreamHost is one of the three web hosting providers that are “officially” <a href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended on the WordPress website</a>.</p>
<p>DreamHost offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared hosting for WordPress</li>
<li>Managed WordPress hosting</li>
<li>VPS for WordPress</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take advantage of one of these options, DreamHost will install WordPress for you. You’ll be able to set up everything with just one click. You’ll also benefit from automatic WordPress updates and automated daily backups of your WordPress site.</p>
<h3>Benefits of DreamHost for web hosting</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve had a chance to get familiar with the wide range of web hosting options offered by DreamHost, it’s time to look at the top features and benefits of this provider.</p>
<h4>Sufficient loading speeds</h4>
<p>Truthfully, DreamHost doesn’t have the fastest loading speeds we’ve seen compared to other web hosting providers. This metric is definitely one of the most important factors to take into consideration when you’re evaluating a web host.</p>
<p>But with that said, they definitely aren’t the slowest either. Here’s a look at the average response times on a <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/zp1kq4gopbjs/3292792/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost test website</a> through the first half of this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43866" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Load-Times.png" alt="Dreamhost Load Times" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Load-Times.png 1974w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Load-Times-300x106.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Load-Times-768x271.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-Load-Times-1024x361.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px" /></p>
<p>Overall, the average response time for the year is 740 ms.</p>
<p>In reality, that’s very fast. But again, I’ve seen sites that load in roughly half the time of DreamHost. With that said, I’d say these averages are sufficient. They aren’t necessarily the fastest web host on the market today, but you should still be happy with their speeds.</p>
<h4>High uptime rates</h4>
<p>If you look at the uptime rates on the same chart above, you’ll see that DreamHost has a 99.928% average uptime so far this year.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/average-hosting-uptime-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent case study</a> conducted by Hosting Facts, the average uptime of 32 popular web hosts is 99.59%. So DreamHost is above that average.</p>
<p>With that said, they fall outside of the top 10 hosts in terms of uptime.</p>
<p>You can look at this the same way you look at their page loading speed. It’s a high number, and more than sufficient for your website, but it’s just not the best compared to the competition.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost terms of service</a>, they guarantee a 100% uptime rate. So if they don’t meet that standard, you’ll receive a credit for one day of service, for every hour that your site is down.</p>
<p>However, that credit will max out at 10% of your next prepaid hosting renewal. This means that it’s a credit toward the next time you’re billed, as opposed to a refund for what you’ve already paid.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that any scheduled maintenance or user errors that cause downtime don’t apply to this promise.</p>
<h4>Money-back guarantee</h4>
<p>Web hosting providers don’t typically offer free trials. In order to see if you’re happy with their service, you’ll need to sign up.</p>
<p>We’ve seen lots of web hosting providers offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. So if you’re not happy with your service in the first month, you’re entitled to a refund.</p>
<p>But DreamHost goes above and beyond anything we’ve seen in terms of a money-back guarantee.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43867" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Money-Back-Guarantee.png" alt="Money Back Guarantee" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Money-Back-Guarantee.png 1540w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Money-Back-Guarantee-300x145.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Money-Back-Guarantee-768x372.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Money-Back-Guarantee-1024x496.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1540px) 100vw, 1540px" /></p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Your eyes are not playing tricks on you.</p>
<p>DreamHost offers a 97-day guarantee! That’s more than three months to try out their web hosting plan to see if you’re satisfied.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this only applies to web hosting fees, and not any add-ons that you paid for.</p>
<p>But when I see a hosting provider offer something like this, it tells me one thing—they stand behind their services. If they thought that the majority of their customers would be asking for refunds, they wouldn’t set up this policy.</p>
<p>This guarantee reduces your risk and makes you feel more confident about your purchase. I’m always more inclined to buy services from companies that stand behind what they’re selling.</p>
<h4>Environmentally friendly</h4>
<p>DreamHost is a “green” web hosting provider, which means they are environmentally conscious.</p>
<p>I know that this doesn’t necessarily impact your site’s performance, but it’s still an important factor to take into consideration.</p>
<p>In order to reduce their carbon footprint, DreamHost uses LED and low-mercury lighting, optimized HVAC plants at their offices. DreamHost data centers have high-efficiency coolers, use renewable energy sources, and participate in “clean wind” programs in certain areas.</p>
<h4>Low renewal rates</h4>
<p>It’s a common practice for web hosting providers to offer low introductory rates, and then jack up the prices when it’s time for the contract to renew.</p>
<p>Depending on the web host, those prices can nearly double.</p>
<p>But DreamHost is one of the few providers that doesn’t use this pricing strategy. Prices don’t automatically increase when you renew your contract.</p>
<p>Instead, DreamHost offers price breaks based on the length of your contract, which we saw earlier when I showed you their plans.</p>
<h4>Unlimited features</h4>
<p>DreamHost offers lots of “unlimiteds” with their web hosting plans, which isn’t always common in the industry.</p>
<p>With a couple of exceptions, you’ll get unlimited disk space and bandwidth with your web hosting plans. They also offer unlimited network transfers and unlimited email options.</p>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>DreamHost isn’t perfect. Even in the benefits listed above, we learned that although they have high uptimes and fast loading speeds, they’re not industry leaders in those categories.</p>
<p>That aside, there are a few other things that you should keep in mind when you’re evaluating DreamHost as a potential service provider for your website.</p>
<h4>Paid site migrations</h4>
<p>Lots of web hosts will throw in a free site migration as an incentive to switch to their service. But that’s not the case with DreamHost.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43868" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Migration-Services.png" alt="Migration Services" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Migration-Services.png 1672w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Migration-Services-300x154.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Migration-Services-768x394.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Migration-Services-1024x525.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1672px) 100vw, 1672px" /></p>
<p>Unless you have a managed WordPress hosting plan, you’ll have to pay $99 for this service.</p>
<p>While it may not be a big deal if you’re only moving one site, this can add up quickly for those of you who are managing websites for your clients.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions for migrations as well. They can’t move multisite WordPress sites or website builder sites.</p>
<p>You can find a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215461357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step-by-step instruction guide</a> on how to do this manually on their website, but it’s not an easy task. I wouldn’t recommend this process if you’re a beginner.</p>
<h4>Limited support</h4>
<p>This piggybacks off of our last point. It seems like other web hosts out there are more willing to do some heavy lifting for their customers.</p>
<p>Beyond that, they have a knowledge base and forums that can be helpful for finding solutions to any questions or problems you might have.</p>
<p>They claim to have 24/7 support, but if you call or try to get help via live chat after hours, you won’t always get what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>The chatbot on their site seems to have limited responses, even in the middle of a weekday.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43869" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chatbot.png" alt="Chatbot" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chatbot.png 712w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chatbot-256x300.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></p>
<p>This is a clip of a conversation I had when I was browsing for cloud hosting plans. The fact that “sales rep” or “sales team” didn’t register another triggered response from this AI bot is kind of surprising.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>DreamHost is a reputable web hosting provider. While they don’t lead the way in every performance category, they still have great options for you to consider.</p>
<p>Would I recommend <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10194/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost</a>? Absolutely.</p>
<p>I like this provider because they have such a wide range of hosting types and plans for you to choose from. Unlike other providers out there, DreamHost is transparent with their pricing, and won’t jack up your rates when it’s time to renew.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ecommerce industry is booming. It seems like everyone is coming up with different ways to get into this space.</p>
<p>But when we think of ecommerce our minds typically don’t jump to food. Most entrepreneurs seem to focus their efforts on inventing or modifying a new product that can solve problems</p>
<p>With that said, there is lots of money to be made in the online food industry.</p>
<p>As of 2018, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1915/us-consumers-online-grocery-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online grocery shopping</a> in the United States is a $17.5 billion industry. But there are plenty of other ways to sell food online as well.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you have a restaurant and want to expand the way your customers order takeout. The global <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/374/100/online-food-delivery/worldwide#market-globalRevenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online food delivery</a> market is growing at a 14.8% year-over-year rate.</p>
<p><span id="more-43821"></span></p>
<p>That’s not all. Take a look at this graph from eMarketer on the projections for total online <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/grocery-ecommerce-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">food and beverage ecommerce sales</a> in the coming years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43876" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Food-Ecommerce-Sales.png" alt="Food Ecommerce Sales" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Food-Ecommerce-Sales.png 1262w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Food-Ecommerce-Sales-300x242.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Food-Ecommerce-Sales-768x621.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Food-Ecommerce-Sales-1024x828.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px" /></p>
<p>Online sales in the US alone are expected to double over the next four years. So it’s safe to say that there is plenty of money to be made in this space.</p>
<p>Here’s the reality of the situation. Everything in our lives has gone digital. We’re ordering everything else online, so it’s only natural that online food sales is the way of the future as well.</p>
<p>But when you search the web for <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/create-ecommerce-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to create an ecommerce site</a>, the resources for selling food online are pretty scarce. That’s what inspired me to create this guide. I’ll tell you everything you need to know about building an online platform for selling food.</p>
<h3>Understand the law</h3>
<p>Before you do anything, you need to make sure that you’re familiar with all of the legal regulations for selling food online. This will vary depending on your location, as well as the type of food you’re selling.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re selling in the United States, you’re going to have to follow different guidelines than if you were selling in Europe.</p>
<p>Here’s something else to take into consideration. Are you planning to prepare and sell food out of your home? Or are you selling out of an industrial kitchen?</p>
<p>Let’s say you were making homemade cupcakes in your kitchen at home. The rules that apply to you will be different than someone who is jarring sauce in the kitchen of their restaurant.</p>
<p>In the United States, you’ll need to follow the <a href="http://www.pickyourown.org/CottageFoodLawsByState.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cottage Food Laws</a>, which vary slightly from state to state. Regardless of your location, here are some guidelines that are pretty standard across the board:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual inspection from the department of health.</li>
<li>Zoning permits from the department of health and/or the department of agriculture.</li>
<li>Valid business license in your operating state.</li>
<li>Ability to properly store food (cold, dry, etc.).</li>
<li>No pets in the home or kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the minimum requirements, and it barely scratches the surface. So be sure to fully review your local requirements before you start selling any food online. Otherwise, you’ll risk violations that can shut your operation down.</p>
<h3>Find a supplier</h3>
<p>No matter what you’re planning to sell, you need to source a reputable supplier. Whether you’re planning to sell pre-made products or if you’re cooking everything on your own, this still applies to you.</p>
<p>The most challenging part about finding the right supplier is establishing their legitimacy.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re planning to prepare food in your home kitchen. Costco would be considered a reputable supplier for your ingredients. Picking apples, tomatoes, or peppers from your neighbor’s garden is not reliable, reputable, or trustworthy.</p>
<p>If you’d rather use an online supplier, you can try using a resource like <a href="https://www.foodmaster.com/directories/72-food-ingredients" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Master</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43877" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FoodMaster.png" alt="FoodMaster" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FoodMaster.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FoodMaster-300x188.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FoodMaster-768x480.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/FoodMaster-1024x640.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>This is a massive online directory of ingredients. You can browse what you’re looking for by category, or search for specific keywords.</p>
<p>If you’re on the fence about a supplier’s reputation, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask them for their credentials. After all, the products you buy from your supplier will ultimately be consumed by your customers. So whatever you buy from them will directly impact your business.</p>
<p>Just because your supplier claims that it’s selling organic produce, it may not necessarily be true. Follow the supply chain to fact check everything.</p>
<h3>Know your niche</h3>
<p>Everybody eats. But that doesn’t mean that everyone is a potential customer.</p>
<p>This is a mistake that I see new entrepreneurs in the online food industry make all of the time. They assume that everyone will enjoy what they’re selling, and they don’t go after a specific niche.</p>
<p>You’ll have much more success if you can clearly define your target audience before you proceed. Then you’ll be able to make necessary adjustments to meet their needs.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at the meal plan options offered by <a href="https://greenchef.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Chef</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43878" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GreenChef.png" alt="GreenChef" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GreenChef.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GreenChef-300x115.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GreenChef-768x295.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GreenChef-1024x393.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>This company is targeting people with special diet needs, such as keto, paleo, or plant-based diets.</p>
<p>Are you going to target working professionals who don’t have time to cook? Or are you targeting families who need healthy options for their children?</p>
<p>Does your site want to focus on college students living in dorms? Or elderly residents who are living on their own?</p>
<p>As you can gather from just these handful of potential examples, the food you’re selling and the way you market yourself would be drastically different in all of these scenarios.</p>
<p>So rather than trying to compete in an over-saturated industry, pick a niche and run with it.</p>
<h3>Focus on branding</h3>
<p>Once your niche has been established, it will be much easier for you to go through the branding process. Your brand will be a combination of what you’re offering as well as who you’re offering it to.</p>
<p>People can buy food anywhere. Your brand needs to explain why they should buy it from you.</p>
<p>Think of a company like McDonald’s. When you hear the name or see their golden arches, you automatically have an association with what they’re offering. They are the epitome of a fast food burger chain. You know exactly what you’re getting and how you’re going to get it.</p>
<p>That’s because they’ve done an excellent job branding themselves. In the online food industry, these are the components you need to prioritize to establish proper branding.</p>
<h4>Brand name</h4>
<p>Your name should go far and beyond what you’re selling. This is another common mistake that I see new food entrepreneurs make all of the time.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you currently sell cupcakes out of your home kitchen. You might be tempted to name your company something like Cassie’s Cupcakes.</p>
<p>But this name puts you in a box. What happens when you want to start selling brownies, cookies, and other baked goods? Don’t let your brand name restrict the future expansion of your company.</p>
<p>Use a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-domain-registrar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">domain registrar</a> like Namecheap to see if the domain name for your brand is available.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43880" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Namecheap.png" alt="Namecheap" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Namecheap.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Namecheap-300x120.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Namecheap-768x308.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Namecheap-1024x410.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>If your name isn’t available, and can’t be purchased for a reasonable price, it’s definitely in your best interest to think of another name. I’d also recommend reviewing my guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-choose-a-brandable-domain-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to choose a brandable domain name</a> for help with this process.</p>
<h4>Colors</h4>
<p>Your brand’s colors will be synonymous with your branding strategy.</p>
<p>Don’t think colors are that important? Think again. Let me give you an example to show you what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>Starbucks.</p>
<p>Without even showing you a picture of this company, their website, or their products, I can almost guarantee that a color popped into your head when you saw the name. That’s because the brand has done a great job with their branding strategy.</p>
<p>I’ll give you another example from the online food space. Let’s take a look at the <a href="https://www.blueapron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Apron</a> website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43881" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BlueApron.png" alt="BlueApron" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BlueApron.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BlueApron-300x148.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BlueApron-768x380.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BlueApron-1024x506.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>This is a fairly obvious example since there’s a color in the brand name. But as expected, the business has a blue logo and the website has a blue theme. If this company had a red or an orange color scheme, then it wouldn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Make sure your colors appeal to your niche. It’s also important to know how certain colors are perceived.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re planning to sell fruits and vegetables online. Having a black or brown color scheme isn’t very appealing. It doesn’t give the perception of products that are fresh. In this case, you’d be better of going with some lighter and brighter tones.</p>
<h4>Packaging and labeling</h4>
<p>Like any product, the packing of the food that you’re selling online needs to be carefully thought out. In addition to having your brand name, logo, and colors integrated on the package, there are other things to take into consideration as well.</p>
<p>Food needs to be packaged in a way that keeps it preserved. If perishable items need to be kept cold, the packaging should reflect that.</p>
<p>There are also certain regulations that need to be followed for shipping foods that are perishable or fragile.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are other requirements for labeling food. Your labels need to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete list of ingredients.</li>
<li>Net quantity.</li>
<li>Weight of all combined ingredients.</li>
<li>Name and location of the company.</li>
<li>Names and locations of suppliers.</li>
<li>Expiration or “best by” dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the packaging and labeling aspects of selling food online will fall within the legal scope of your operation, which we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>But it’s important to find a balance between a packaging that’s appealing to your customers while meeting all of those legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Figure out your pricing strategy</h3>
<p>Now it’s time to figure out how your online food store is going to make money.</p>
<p>You can’t just pull a price out of thin air. It’s important to factor in all of your operational and business costs to ensure that your products are priced in a way that is profitable for you. Your pre-defined niche will also factor into your pricing strategy.</p>
<p>For example, a business professional living and working in New York City will likely be willing to spend more on a single serving than a family of five living in the midwest.</p>
<p>You’ve got to come up with a pricing formula that drives ecommerce conversions. Take a look at <a href="https://www.freshly.com/plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freshly’s pricing</a> as a reference.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43882" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freshly-Pricing.png" alt="Freshly Pricing" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freshly-Pricing.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freshly-Pricing-300x127.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freshly-Pricing-768x324.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freshly-Pricing-1024x432.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>They’re using an age-old strategy, that’s not limited to the online food industry. As quantity increases, price decreases.</p>
<p>The cost per meal drops nearly 30% if a customer orders 12 meals per week as opposed to just 4. Sure, they’re making less per meal, but they’re getting more than double the weekly revenue from one subscription over the other.</p>
<p>If the cost per meal didn’t change based on quantity, then it doesn’t give your customers an incentive to spend more money.</p>
<p>Here’s something else to consider with the Freshly pricing strategy. All of the plans offer free shipping.</p>
<p>This is all related to perceived value. If you charge extra for things like shipping, it lowers the overall value of what you&#8217;re selling.</p>
<p>Review my guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-generate-more-profits-by-focusing-on-your-pricing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to generate more profits by focusing on your pricing strategy</a>. All of these concepts can be applied to businesses that sell food online.</p>
<h3>Create an online store</h3>
<p>There are two ways to sell food online. Each one is very different.</p>
<p>First, you can sell through online marketplaces, like Etsy or Amazon. Alternatively, you can sell through your own ecommerce platform.</p>
<p>If you’re going to use a marketplace, you need to meet additional regulations. These are put in place by the marketplace to protect themselves, as well as their customers. You’ll also need to get your company approved to sell through a marketplace by following specific standards.</p>
<p>You won’t have to take responsibility for managing a website and you’ll be able to reach an existing global audience if you decide to go through a marketplace. However, you lose some control and credibility with this method.</p>
<p>Personally, I’d recommend building your own ecommerce website to sell food online.</p>
<p>It might take a bit more effort on your end to get everything set up and running, but it gives you complete control.</p>
<p>In order to create your own online food store, you’ll need to choose a platform. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/sell/food-and-beverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a> is a great option for this.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43883" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shopify.png" alt="Shopify" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shopify.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shopify-300x181.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shopify-768x464.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shopify-1024x618.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>They’ll provide you with an easy to use interface, all the tools you need to track your orders, and professional templates that are specifically designed for selling food online.</p>
<p>If you’re not sold on Shopify, I’d recommend <a href="https://www.wix.com/website/templates/html/online-store/food-drinks-ecom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wix</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/food-beverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BicCommerce</a> as alternative options.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There is a huge demand for online food. As ecommerce continues to grow and evolve, people are buying online more than ever before.</p>
<p>The online food industry is growing at a rapid rate. This is the perfect opportunity for you to take advantage of this situation.</p>
<p>But before you can start selling online, there are some preliminary steps that you need to take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate yourself on the legal side of online food sales.</li>
<li>Source a reputable supplier.</li>
<li>Identify your target market.</li>
<li>Create a brand.</li>
<li>Learn how to properly package and label your products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all of that has been taken care of, you’ll be ready to build an online store. After that’s set up, you’ll be able to sell food online with ease.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re in the market for a new web hosting service, <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HostGator</a> is certainly an option that will come on your radar. It’s a reputable company within the web hosting industry.</p>
<p>Like most web hosts, HostGator has a wide range of plans, options, and hosting types to accommodate the needs of different websites.</p>
<p>Today, I want to put more emphasis on the HostGator Cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting is new compared to other <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/everything-about-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">types of web hosting</a>. Rather than your website being hosted on a local server, it’s hosted on multiple remote servers.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of cloud hosting is the ability to scale on-demand. So it’s a great option for fast-growing websites with high volatility in their site traffic.</p>
<p>For those of you who are interested in using the cloud to host your website, I strongly recommend that you review my analysis of HostGator Cloud. I’ll cover their plans, pricing, benefits, and everything else that you need to know before finalizing your decision.</p>
<p><span id="more-43820"></span></p>
<h3>HostGator Cloud Web Hosting Plans</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43884" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Cloud-Hosting.png" alt="HostGator Cloud Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Cloud-Hosting.png 1982w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Cloud-Hosting-300x71.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Cloud-Hosting-768x183.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Cloud-Hosting-1024x244.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1982px) 100vw, 1982px" /></p>
<p>There are three cloud plans offered by HostGator. The cloud uses premium hardware, low-density servers, and multiple layers for caching. As a result, this speeds up your page loading times.</p>
<p>As your traffic increases, HostGator Cloud plans make it possible for you to increase your resources with a click on-demand. All of this happens without any downtime, reboots, or data migrations.</p>
<p>Regardless of the plan you choose, you’ll have access to HostGator’s intuitive dashboard. From here, you’ll be able to monitor all of the metrics related to your website’s performance.</p>
<p>That’s what you’ll use to allocate any additional resources accordingly. Basically, you have complete control of your usage with the HostGator Cloud.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at each individual cloud hosting plan.</p>
<h4>Hatchling Cloud</h4>
<p>The Hatchling Cloud is the entry-level cloud hosting plan from HostGator. It’s made for hosting one domain and has 2 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Like all cloud plans, the Hatchling comes with a free SSL certificate.</p>
<p>Pricing for this plan starts at $4.95 per month as an introductory offer. Your contract will renew at $8.95 per month.</p>
<p>You can add on SiteLock monitoring, CodeGuard site backups, professional email, and HostGator SEO tools for additional annual fees.</p>
<p>This plan is <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-create-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best for new websites</a> that want to be hosted on the cloud. Even though you can allocate new resources on demand, you’ll likely want to upgrade as your total monthly traffic increases.</p>
<h4>Baby Cloud</h4>
<p>Here’s a quick glance at what the Baby Cloud offers compared to the Hatchling.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43885" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Baby-Cloud.png" alt="Baby Cloud" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Baby-Cloud.png 1460w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Baby-Cloud-300x236.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Baby-Cloud-768x604.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Baby-Cloud-1024x805.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1460px) 100vw, 1460px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the Baby Cloud can host unlimited domains, and has twice as much available CPU space, and double the memory.</p>
<p>The rate for new cloud customers is $7.95 per month, before renewing at $11.95 per month. Right now they’re running a deal where you can actually get the introductory rate reduced down to $6.57 per month, which is a great value.</p>
<p>All you need to do is sign up and the discount will automatically be applied at the checkout.</p>
<p>This is the most popular cloud hosting plan offered by HostGator. I’d say it will likely be the option that’s the most suitable for the majority of you.</p>
<h4>Business Cloud</h4>
<p>The Business Cloud is HostGator’s top-tier cloud hosting plan. Like the Baby Cloud, it also hosts an unlimited number of domains on a single plan.</p>
<p>However, the Business plan comes with access to 6 cores, as opposed to just 2 or 4 cores on the Hatchling and Baby plans. Your HostGator Business Cloud also has access to 6 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>It’s the only cloud hosting plan that comes standard with a dedicated IP address. This feature is not available on the Hatchling plan and it costs an additional $4 per month on the Baby Cloud plan.</p>
<p>Considering that the Business Cloud starts at $9.95 per month, that extra feature is a great value. However, it’s worth noting that renewals jump up to $17.95 per month once your initial contract expires.</p>
<h3>Alternative Hostgator hosting options</h3>
<p>While the primary focus of this review is on the HostGator Cloud, I would be doing you a disservice if I didn’t mention the other hosting options offered by this provider.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting isn’t for everyone. So if you’re in the market for a more traditional type of web hosting plan, you may want to consider one of these options as an alternative.</p>
<h4>Dedicated server hosting</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43886" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Dedicated-Server.png" alt="HostGator Dedicated Server" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Dedicated-Server.png 1526w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Dedicated-Server-300x103.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Dedicated-Server-768x263.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Dedicated-Server-1024x350.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1526px) 100vw, 1526px" /></p>
<p>With a dedicated server, your website will be renting a physical server from HostGator. This server will only be used for your site.</p>
<p>It’s a faster option than shared or VPS hosting since you won’t be sharing any resources, storage, or bandwidth with other websites.</p>
<p>Dedicated servers are ideal for those of you who are a bit more tech-savvy. If you want complete control over your server in terms of security and flexibility, this is your best bet.</p>
<p>Pricing for HostGator dedicated servers starts at:</p>
<ul>
<li>$118.99 per month for the Value Server</li>
<li>$138.99 per month for the Power Server</li>
<li>$148.98 per month for the Enterprise Server</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the cloud hosting plans, these dedicated servers are priced significantly higher.</p>
<h4>VPS hosting</h4>
<p>Virtual private servers from HostGator give you flexible software options. You’ll gain full root access, which gives you added control in your environment.</p>
<p>The VPS plans are a step up from shared hosting, but not quite as in-depth or expensive as the dedicated servers. For comparison purposes, let’s take a look at how these VPS plans are priced, so you can weigh them as an option against cloud hosting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Snappy 2000 — $29.95 per month</li>
<li>Snappy 4000 — $39.95 per month</li>
<li>Snappy 8000 — $49.95 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re already using cPannel for web hosting, SiteGround will migrate you to VPS hosting for free.</p>
<h4>Shared hosting</h4>
<p>If you’re on a budget and don’t want to use the cloud, shared hosting is the bottom-tier plan offered by HostGator.</p>
<p>Plans start at $2.75 per month, $3.95 per month, and $5.95 per month, respectively.</p>
<p>The problem with this option is that you’re going to be sharing resources with other websites. So if those sites have traffic spikes or higher volumes of visitors, it will impact the metrics on your site as well.</p>
<p>So if you want to save some money, but don’t want to sacrifice performance, cloud hosting will be a better option for you. Shared hosting doesn’t give you the flexibility to manage your resources the way that cloud hosting does.</p>
<h3>Benefits of HostGator Cloud for web hosting</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve had a chance to see some of the other types of web hosting offered by HostGator, let’s get back to focusing on the HostGator Cloud.</p>
<p>The following benefits refer specifically to the cloud plans. So for those of you who are considering one of those alternative options, I can’t guarantee the same advantages.</p>
<h4>High uptimes and fast load times</h4>
<p>When measuring the performance of a web hosting service, uptime and page loading speeds are two of the most important metrics to consider. Let’s take a look at how a <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/zp1kq4gopbjs/1972788/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HostGator Cloud test website</a> performed so far this year.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43887" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Uptimes.png" alt="HostGator Uptimes" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Uptimes.png 1980w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Uptimes-300x103.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Uptimes-768x264.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/HostGator-Uptimes-1024x352.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1980px) 100vw, 1980px" /></p>
<p>Over the past six months, HostGator Cloud had a 99.995% average uptime rate. That’s about as exceptional as it gets.</p>
<p>As you can see from the table above, the page loading speed fluctuates quite a bit so far this year. The fastest average monthly response time was 280 ms, while the slowest was 736 ms. But on average, the response time in 2019 is 514 ms.</p>
<p>Truthfully, it’s definitely not the fastest loading time we’ve seen. But with that said, it’s still very fast, and far from the slowest.</p>
<p>Based on these numbers, I can’t say that you’ll be disappointed with your uptimes or loading speed if you decide to go with a cloud hosting plan from HostGator.</p>
<h4>User-friendly</h4>
<p>HostGator Cloud is very easy to use. It’s a great option for beginners, as well as users who have more experience with web hosting.</p>
<p>The cloud plans make it possible for you to allocate your resources as needed whenever you’re experiencing traffic spikes. That’s not the case with their other plans, which would require you to upgrade as you reached limitations on resources.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve never done this before, the interface is very easy to manage.</p>
<p>Another reason why HostGator Cloud is so user-friendly is because you won’t have to worry about outrageous pricing. These plans don’t surprise you with monthly overage fees when you exceed your plan limits. That’s a major downside of other web hosting plans.</p>
<h4>Lots of freebies</h4>
<p>The reason why cloud hosting from HostGator is so fast is because it doesn’t rely on typical servers. Instead, the servers from remote data centers work in unison with a person’s web browser to limit the number of resources required to host the website.</p>
<p>Things like managed cloud resources, data mirroring, and integrated caching make this possible, which comes free with your cloud hosting plan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you’ll get free server monitoring to alert you if there are any hardware problems.</p>
<p>When you sign up for HostGator cloud, you’ll have access to cPannel as well. As I said before, you’ll get a free migration if you’ve been using cPannel with your current web host.</p>
<h4>Easy access to customer support</h4>
<p>HostGator Cloud comes with 24/7/365 customer support, which is crucial for web hosting. My favorite part about this is their <a href="https://support.hostgator.com/articles/hosting-guide/lets-get-started/cloud-sites-server-usage-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support portal</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than having to pick up the phone or chat online, there’s a good chance you can find the answer to your question here.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a tutorial that explains the step-by-step process of how to add resources to your cloud hosting plan.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43889" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Update-Plan.png" alt="Hostgator Update Plan" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Update-Plan.png 1032w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Update-Plan-266x300.png 266w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Update-Plan-768x866.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Update-Plan-908x1024.png 908w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p>
<p>HostGator has tons of these for nearly every aspect of cloud hosting. It’s a quick way to find a solution to your problem.</p>
<p>With that said, phone support and live chat is always available as well. Personally, I prefer live chat as opposed to picking up the phone. But you’ll have both options depending on your personal preference.</p>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>Based on the benefits that we just discussed, I think we’ve established that HostGator Cloud is a top choice to consider if you want to use cloud hosting. But with that said, there are a couple of things that you need to keep in mind before you make that decision.</p>
<p>I briefly touched on this earlier when we discussed the cloud hosting plans, but the initial rates are just introductory offers. When your contract renews, you’ll be paying more.</p>
<p>Depending on your plan, you can expect prices to increase by roughly 80%.</p>
<p>While HostGator has its fair share of freebies, there are also some upsells along the way as well. Some of these are automatically checked off in your shopping cart, so make sure you review that page thoroughly before you commit to anything.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HostGator</a> is a reputable name in the web hosting space. Their cloud hosting service is a great option for those of you who want to take advantage of cloud website hosting.</p>
<p>If you compare those plans to their standard shared hosting options, the cloud is the superior choice in my opinion.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t think cloud hosting is for you then you could always consider VPS or dedicated server hosting from HostGator as well.</p>
<p>For those of you who still aren’t convinced on the HostGator Cloud, you can check out my list of the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best web hosting services</a> for some other viable options.</p>

<p>But the design and layout of your website will have a huge impact on its success.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://learn.g2.com/web-design-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">48% of people</a> say that the design of a website is the top factor they use when it comes to determining how credible a business is. 38% of people will stop using websites with unattractive layouts.</p>
<p>So if you want to create unique and beautiful landing pages without having to design them from scratch, you’re going to want to use pre-designed templates. WordPress is the best place to find these.</p>
<p>That’s because WordPress is the <a href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular CMS platform in the world</a>, and has been for the past seven years in a row.</p>
<p>It controls nearly 60% of the entire CMS market across the globe. With more than 500 new sites launching on WordPress each day, it’s also the fastest growing CMS worldwide. 34% of the whole internet is run via WordPress.</p>
<p>So if you were on the fence about using WordPress to manage your site, hopefully now you’re convinced.</p>
<p>For those of you who are already using WordPress, you’re ahead of the game. Now it’s time to design the best landing pages for your WordPress site.</p>
<p>With so many options to choose from, I’ve narrowed down the top 11 WordPress landing page templates to make the decision much easier for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://themeforest.net/item/landkit-wordpress-landing-page-theme/20425881?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Landkit</a> is extremely easy to use, yet it’s designed for high performance.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are nearly <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.7 billion websites</a> worldwide. This number continues to grow each day.</p>
<p>What do all of these sites have in common? In one way or another, they all use some form of HTML. That’s why learning basic HTML is such a useful skill.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. You can definitely <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-create-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a website without having to write a line of code</a>. But with that said, once your site is live you should still know how to read and some HTML on your own.</p>
<p>So whether you’re creating a new website, have an existing website, or you just want to learn more about coding, this is guide will serve as the perfect introduction to HTML for you.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics. What exactly is HTML?</p>
<p><span id="more-43798"></span></p>
<p>This acronym stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it’s the standard format used to create web pages, web applications, and documents. This computer language is a series of code that is typically written in a text file and then saved as HTML. When viewed on a web browser, this code translates to a properly formatted blend of text and other media.</p>
<p>HTML is behind every web page you see online, including this page that you’re reading right now.</p>
<h3>Understanding hypertext and markup language</h3>
<p>As I’ve already mentioned, HTML stands for hypertext markup language. But those words don’t mean much to most people, so I want to break them down even further so you can fully understand the definition.</p>
<p>The word hypertext dates back more than 50 years. It was invented to describe links in a document that make it possible for a viewer to jump to another place in the document or to a completely new document. This is something that we see and use every day in the modern Internet.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of what <a href="https://www.media-studies.ca/articles/hypertext.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypertext</a> looks like.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43800" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hypertext.png" alt="Hypertext" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hypertext.png 904w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hypertext-300x187.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hypertext-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>I’m sure you’re familiar with hyperlinks, which is a form of hypertext.</p>
<p>As you browse online, you’ll see either http:// or https:// before every web page in your web browser. This stands for hypertext transfer protocol.</p>
<p>Markup language refers to how documents and web pages are displayed. You see words that are bold, italic, or larger on a page. But behind the scenes, the markup language is the reason why certain components appear differently on a page.</p>
<p>Markups are characterized by tags and attributes. Most of the time these tags come in pairs. There are start tags and end tags, which are also known as opening tags and closing tags.</p>
<h3>When to use HTML</h3>
<p>HTML is the default language for all websites on the Internet. But it’s also used for various types of documents, such as ebooks.</p>
<p>When an HTML document gets rendered by a web browser, all of the markup language and tags are hidden. The display automatically gets changed to display a reader-friendly version of the document (what you’re seeing right now).</p>
<p>Do you need to learn HTML to create a website?</p>
<p>The short answer is no. Unless you’re planning to build pages from scratch and pursue web development, you won’t necessarily need to know every single component of HTML.</p>
<p>You can probably get away without knowing HTML if you’re using a CMS, <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-website-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website builder</a>, or blogging platform. For example, if you’re using WordPress as your blogging CMS, the visual editor automatically translates your text to HTML.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43801" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Editor.png" alt="Wordpress Editor" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Editor.png 964w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Editor-300x174.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wordpress-Editor-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px" /></p>
<p>Working in the visual editor will display content similar to a standard email message or Microsoft Word document.</p>
<p>With that said, there are times when visual editors don’t always work the way you want to. You might find yourself in a situation where you want to format something a certain way and it’s not getting displayed properly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your HTML also needs to be optimized for non-human readers. Search engine bots are crawling your website for indexing purposes. The way that your HTML gets read will have an impact on your SEO.</p>
<p>Website accessibility also needs to be taken into consideration. Computers can translate web pages into sound for people with disabilities. They rely on the structure and quality of HTML for this.</p>
<p>While the platforms on the market today make it possible to operate a website without knowing HTML, it’s still in your best interest to learn the basics.</p>
<h3>Choosing your HTML editor</h3>
<p>For those of you who are planning to create web pages using HTML, you’ll need to use an HTML editor.</p>
<p>These editors are the best way to organize your code and keep everything clean. Editors are great because they recognize whenever a new tag is opened. These tags are automatically closed by the software, ensuring that your code doesn’t have bugs. This also limits the number of typing and keystrokes you have to make.</p>
<p>The best HTML editors let you preview your HTML to see how the content will look from a web browser. There are tons of options online. But I’ve narrowed down a handful of the top HTML editors for you to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notepad++</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sublime Text</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coffeecup.com/free-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoffeeCup</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.htmlkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML-Kit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atom</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also practice HTML with this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free tool from W3Schools</a>. That’s what I’m going to use to show you examples of HTML as we continue.</p>
<h3>HTML basics</h3>
<p>Before you start writing HTML, you need to understand the three main components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags</li>
<li>Attributes</li>
<li>Elements</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be described as the building blocks or foundation of HTML. Once you learn what these are and how they work, it will be easier for you to move forward. I’ll go into greater detail on each of these below.</p>
<h4>Tags</h4>
<p>In short, tags are used to distinguish HTML code from normal text. The way your document gets displayed will be based on the tag instructions.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Let’s say you want to make something bold.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43802" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bold-Example.png" alt="Bold Example" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bold-Example.png 1744w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bold-Example-300x93.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bold-Example-768x237.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bold-Example-1024x316.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1744px) 100vw, 1744px" /></p>
<p>The tag for bold is &lt;b&gt;, which is pictured above. This compares to the text above it, which is &lt;p&gt;, or a standard paragraph text.</p>
<p>Once the code is rendered, it’s displayed how we would normally see it on a web page, as you can see from the right side of the screenshot above.</p>
<p>Now let’s say you wanted to make something italicized. The HTML tag would look like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43803" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/italicized-example.png" alt="italicized example" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/italicized-example.png 1666w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/italicized-example-300x62.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/italicized-example-768x158.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/italicized-example-1024x210.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1666px) 100vw, 1666px" /></p>
<p>Pretty straightforward, right?</p>
<p>All I’m doing is using the tags to change the way the text appears when it’s on a web page.</p>
<p>Take a look at those tags closely. Do you notice a difference between the opening tag and closing tag? The closing tags have a slash, indicating that the italics, bold, or whatever other tag you’re using stops here.</p>
<p>If that example above didn’t have a slash in the closing tag, anything written after it would continue to be italicized.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks are also created with tags. Here’s what the HTML tag would look like if I wanted to hyperlink to the Quick Sprout homepage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43804" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Link-Example.png" alt="Link Example" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Link-Example.png 1548w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Link-Example-300x67.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Link-Example-768x173.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Link-Example-1024x230.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1548px) 100vw, 1548px" /></p>
<p>This tag is a little bit more in-depth than the bold and italics examples. But the same concept still applies.</p>
<p>There is an opening tag and closing tag with text in between. The way these tags are written determines what the result will look like on the web page.</p>
<p>Every web page starts with a &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. Then the first line of the file says &lt;html&gt; as well. You can see this on the three examples that I showed you above. This tells browsers how to read the code.</p>
<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>An HTML element consists of the opening tag, closing tag, and the content in between the two.</p>
<p>So when we were going through different examples of tags, each example was a new element. For example, let’s take a look at some potential lines of HTML.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43805" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Element-Example.png" alt="Element Example" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Element-Example.png 1638w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Element-Example-300x111.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Element-Example-768x285.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Element-Example-1024x380.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1638px) 100vw, 1638px" /></p>
<p>When you look on the right side of the screen at the page version of this code, you see four total sentences and two paragraphs.</p>
<p>Now, look at the HTML code on the left side of this split screen. You can see how the three different elements are identified.</p>
<p>Elements can be simple, such as the bold example above, or they can be a bit more complex.</p>
<p>The document above starts with an open &lt;body&gt; tag, and also ends with a closed &lt;/body&gt; tag. So everything within those two tags can also be considered one element. But within that entire body, there could be dozens, hundreds, or thousands of additional elements, depending on how long and complex your content is.</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>For the most part, tags are used to define how content is displayed in HTML. But with that said, there are times when additional information within an element needs to be added.</p>
<p>In these instances, you would use an attribute to define a specific characteristic of the element in question. Attributes consist of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Value</li>
</ul>
<p>They are placed inside the start tag of an element. Here’s an example to show you what I mean.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43806" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attribution-Example.png" alt="Attribution Example" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attribution-Example.png 1738w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attribution-Example-300x84.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attribution-Example-768x214.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Attribution-Example-1024x285.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1738px) 100vw, 1738px" /></p>
<p>The attribute used here is align=”center” and it falls within the &lt;p&gt; opening tag. It means that whatever text comes before the closing &lt;/p&gt; tag will have a specific characteristic defined by the attribution.</p>
<p>In this case, the attribute said to center the text.</p>
<p>We saw another example of this earlier when I created a hyperlink for the Quick Sprout home page.</p>
<h3>Beginner HTML cheat sheet</h3>
<p>There are thousands of different ways you can write content in HTML. But if you’re just starting out with, there’s no reason for you to learn all of them right away.</p>
<p>Instead, I’ll show you some basic HTML tags and explain what they’re used for. Then you can practice applying them in an HTML editor.</p>
<h4>Heading tags</h4>
<p>&lt;head&gt; … &lt;/head&gt;</p>
<p>These tags are used to showcase specific information on pages such as title tags and meta tags. Proper use of <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-use-heading-tags-to-get-more-search-engine-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heading tags can increase your search engine traffic</a>.</p>
<h4>Title tags</h4>
<p>&lt;title&gt; … &lt;/title&gt;</p>
<p>Your title will appear within the header of the page. It will give search engine crawlers more information about the primary content of a particular page.</p>
<h4>Paragraph tags</h4>
<p>&lt;p&gt; … &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>You’ve seen these throughout the examples that I showed you above. They denote a new paragraph of text.</p>
<h4>Hyperlinks</h4>
<p>&lt;a href=”link”&gt; … &lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>This tag and attribute is used to display the anchor text for hyperlinks. The full link would be written in between the quotation marks.</p>
<h4>Images</h4>
<p>&lt;img /&gt;</p>
<p>Image tags are used to present image files on the page.</p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>&lt;table&gt; … &lt;/table&gt;</p>
<p>This tag contains all of the information related to content in a table. It also identifies content as a table.</p>
<h4>Footers</h4>
<p>&lt;footer&gt; … &lt;/footer&gt;</p>
<p>Anything in between these tags would be in the footer block of a page.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Every website uses HTML. So if you’re building a website or currently manage a website, it’s in your best interest to know what’s going on behind the scenes of your web pages.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that you should go out and start building pages from scratch without any experience as a developer. There’s really no reason for that.</p>
<p>But you should have a basic understanding of what HTML is, how it works, and where to edit it on your website.</p>
<p>Here’s what I suggest. Use one of the HTML editors that I showed you earlier to practice your basic coding skills. Then just go through and try to replicate some of the examples that I covered in this beginner guide.</p>
<p>That’s the best way to get your feet wet with HTML if you don’t have any experience with it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I’m sure you’ve figured out by now, building a website takes lots of hard work. This is even more so the case for those of you who are <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/create-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating an ecommerce site</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your website design, architecture, and all of the standard website elements, you also need to figure out how you’re going to accept payments online.</p>
<p>If you’ve never done this before and you’re just starting some preliminary research, there’s a good chance that you’ll come across two names; PayPal and Stripe. These are both industry leaders in the online payment processing industry.</p>
<p>Both platforms will essentially let your customers buy products or services from your ecommerce shop, but the way that these services are provided are different from platform to platform.</p>
<p>So what’s the difference between PayPal and Stripe? Is PayPal or Stripe better for accepting payments online? These are questions that I hear all of the time when I’m consulting with ecommerce companies.</p>
<p><span id="more-43791"></span></p>
<p>Truthfully, you probably can’t go wrong with either one. But with that said, I want to give you as much information as possible about each platform so you can decide which one is right for your ecommerce business.</p>
<h3>Basics of payment gateways</h3>
<p>Before we continue, I want to make sure you understand exactly how PayPal and Stripe work. There are two terms you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payment gateway</li>
<li>Payment service provider</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment gateways give ecommerce sites the capability to accept payments online. These gateways are like a middleman between a business payment processor and credit card network. PayPal and Stripe both have payment gateways, which you’ll need if you’re planning to authorize online payments.</p>
<p>A payment service provider (or PSP for short) on the other hand is a bit more involved. PayPal and Stripe are both PSPs as well. They link businesses with merchant accounts by providing the technology required to process online payments, as well as other forms of payment.</p>
<p>PayPal and Stripe group all of their merchants into one account, as opposed to each business having a dedicated account.</p>
<p>Basically, both of these platforms have everything you need to authorize payments as an ecommerce website.</p>
<h3>PayPal for ecommerce</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43792" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-for-Ecommerce.png" alt="Paypal for Ecommerce" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-for-Ecommerce.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-for-Ecommerce-300x135.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-for-Ecommerce-768x345.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-for-Ecommerce-1024x461.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>Even if you have no prior experience with running an ecommerce website, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/business-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal</a> is definitely a name that you’ve heard before.</p>
<p>The company has always been known for payment processing. They have the reputation for being a safe and secure way for PayPal users to buy from merchants using a PayPal balance as well as a debit or credit account linked to their PayPal profile.</p>
<p>But PayPal offers much more features and services to accommodate ecommerce shops. So the days of PayPal only being suitable for things like eBay or other P2P payment situations are long behind us. Now they have a variety of plans for launching a business, whether you want to sell online, in person, or both.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to accept payments from credit cards, debit cards, PayPal credits, PayPal accounts, and Venmo as well.</p>
<p>With PayPal, you can design your own shopping cart. They have customizable solutions that are fully scalable for growing businesses.</p>
<p>PayPal offers three main plans for you to choose from. I’ll cover each one in greater detail below.</p>
<h4>PayPal Checkout</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43793" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-Checkout.png" alt="Paypal Checkout" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-Checkout.png 1654w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-Checkout-300x161.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-Checkout-768x412.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Paypal-Checkout-1024x550.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1654px) 100vw, 1654px" /></p>
<p>For those of you who already have an existing payment processor that you’re using to accept credit cards on your ecommerce site, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal Checkout</a> might be a good option for you to consider.</p>
<p>Basically, you can just add the PayPal button to your current payments page with this supplemental plan. It’s easy to integrate with your existing ecommerce platform. Once the button is added, your customers will be able to use PayPal, PayPal credits, or Venmo to buy from your online store.</p>
<p>Conversion rates are up to 82% higher when PayPal Checkout is added to ecommerce sites. That’s because shoppers can complete the purchase in just a click or two, if they have PayPal on their phones or if they’re already logged into PayPal on their computers.</p>
<p>There is no setup fee or monthly fee for this plan. PayPal charges merchants 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction in the United States.</p>
<h4>PayPal Payments Standard</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal Payments Standard</a> plan is made for merchants who don’t have an existing payment processor or want to switch providers.</p>
<p>In addition to the PayPal payment options, you’ll also be able to accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover cards. Adding the button to your website is as simple as copying and pasting some code. The checkout pages will be hosted by PayPal.</p>
<p>This plan will cost you 2.9% + $0.30 per US transaction. There are no monthly fees or setup fees for the Payments Standard plan.</p>
<h4>PayPal Payments Pro</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Payments Pro</a> is the top-tier plan offered by PayPal. It allows you to create a fully customizable checkout experience on your ecommerce site.</p>
<p>Unlike the Payments Standard plan, website visitors won’t have to leave your site to complete the checkout process. It also has a <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/mobile-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile-optimized checkout process</a> and easy shopping cart integration. Payments Pro gives you a virtual terminal, which makes it possible to accept payments over the phone as well.</p>
<p>With the added features, this plan costs $30 per month, plus the standard 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.</p>
<h3>Stripe for ecommerce</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43794" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-for-Ecommerce.png" alt="Stripe for Ecommerce" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-for-Ecommerce.png 1684w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-for-Ecommerce-300x193.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-for-Ecommerce-768x493.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-for-Ecommerce-1024x658.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1684px) 100vw, 1684px" /></p>
<p>Unlike PayPal, <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a> doesn’t have their services segmented into tiered plans. Stripe’s payment processing will be the same, regardless of what features you’re taking advantage of.</p>
<p>With that said, depending on which tools you want to use, it will cost more. But the nice part about this is that you’re only going to be charged for the features that you actually want, as opposed to paying for a plan that includes tools you don’t need.</p>
<p>You can easily add Stripe to your ecommerce site with just one simple integration.</p>
<p>Once that happens, the platform makes it easy for you to accept payments, process them, settle, and reconcile. You’ll be able to process credit cards and ACH transfers both online and via <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-boost-sales-by-accomodating-the-needs-of-mobile-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile app payments</a>. In fact, big mobile app brands like Lyft are already using Stripe.</p>
<p>Stripe lets you build a checkout process from scratch, or select one of their pre-built templates.</p>
<p>The platform has features for invoicing and setting up recurring payments for subscriptions as well. Let’s take a look at some of those add-on features I was talking about earlier.</p>
<h4>Connect</h4>
<p>Stripe Connect is made so that marketplaces and platforms can accept money and pay it out to third parties. It supports ecommerce sites, crowdfunding, on-demand businesses, and travel or event platforms.</p>
<p>Take advantage of Stripe’s UI components that are pre-built, or use their tools to create and customize everything on your own.</p>
<h4>Sigma</h4>
<p>Sigma helps businesses analyze data from stripe using SQL. It can help improve the efficiency of business operations, finance departments, data teams, and product management.</p>
<p>It’s a great way for you to get to know your business better with data. Then you can make necessary adjustments based on your findings. Pricing for Stripe Sigma varies based on the volume of monthly charges.</p>
<h4>Atlas</h4>
<p>Stripe Atlas is made for those of you who are starting an online business from scratch. The startup toolkit guides you through the process of forming a company, establishing IP ownership, filling out the right documents, and getting a tax ID number from the IRS.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43796" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-Atlas.png" alt="Stripe Atlas" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-Atlas.png 1984w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-Atlas-300x75.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-Atlas-768x191.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-Atlas-1024x255.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1984px) 100vw, 1984px" /></p>
<p>Atlas also sets you up with a new bank account and debit card for your business.</p>
<p>There is a $500 one-time fee for using this service. Services like bank account maintenance, tax filing, and registered agents are not included in the setup fee. These are all billed individually at an annual rate.</p>
<h4>Radar</h4>
<p>Radar is Stripe’s fraud detection, prevention, and management tool. It’s designed to analyze your data and stop potential fraud cases before they are processed.</p>
<p>They take data from your checkout flows, payments, and financial partners to determine irregularities. Stripe’s partnership with major credit card companies and banks make it possible for them to identify fraudulent charges before you need to make a dispute.</p>
<h4>Issuing</h4>
<p>Stripe Issuing is made for ecommerce businesses that want to create, distribute, and manage both physical and virtual cards for in-house purposes.</p>
<p>You can use these cards for things like employee expense accounts. It’s supported by Google Pay and Apple Pay as well. It’s also worth noting that Stripe Issuing is a beta program that’s only being offered in the United States.</p>
<h4>Terminal</h4>
<p>For years, Stripe was better known for its online payment processing. But now they offer Stripe Terminal, which is a POS system for in-person payments.</p>
<p>This is a great option for those of you who have physical store locations in addition to your ecommerce shop. You can get everything you need both online and in-store from the same provider.</p>
<h3>PayPal and Stripe compared</h3>
<p>As you can see from everything that we’ve covered so far, these two payment service providers are very different from each other. But with that said, they have some things in common as well.</p>
<p>Deciding between PayPal and Stripe will mostly come down to personal preference and exactly what you’re looking for. Let’s take a look at some specific features to see how each platform stacks up against the other.</p>
<h4>Price</h4>
<p>The pricing for PayPal is very straightforward. Only the Payments Pro plan has a monthly fee, while all three plans charge 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.</p>
<p>Stripe also charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. But they do have custom pricing packages for things like volume discounts and multi-product discounts, which can be useful for those of you who want to take advantage of the products we looked at earlier.</p>
<p>According to research <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/credit-card-processing/best-online-credit-card-processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Value Penguin</a>, Stripe is more expensive than PayPal.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43797" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-vs-Paypal-cost.png" alt="Stripe vs Paypal cost" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-vs-Paypal-cost.png 1384w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-vs-Paypal-cost-300x120.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-vs-Paypal-cost-768x306.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Stripe-vs-Paypal-cost-1024x408.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1384px) 100vw, 1384px" /></p>
<p>It can be argued that Stripe has more to offer, which might justify that higher amount. But when you compare the cost per transaction rates head to head, both services are even.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>Both PayPal and Stripe offer excellent customer service and technical support options. They each have their own variation of a help center, with different tools, guides, FAQ, and resources needed to troubleshoot on your own.</p>
<p>You can also get help using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Live chat</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Social media</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on all of this, I don’t think that I can definitively say that one platform has better support than the other, so this category is a tie.</p>
<h4>Ease of use</h4>
<p>Stripe and PayPal are both easy to use. But with that said, Stripe is definitely more developer-friendly, meaning it could present more of a challenge to ecommerce store owners who don’t have that type of technical knowledge.</p>
<p>PayPal is as simple as copying and pasting some code to get set up, which is about as straightforward as it gets. So I’d say PayPal is better for beginners, while Stripe has more customizable options for developers.</p>
<h4>Contracts</h4>
<p>Both PayPal and Stripe offer pay as you go contracts. So you won’t get locked into anything long term and can cancel at any time. You also won’t be charged a cancellation fee by either service if you decide to do so.</p>
<p>This category is another tie.</p>
<h4>Reputation</h4>
<p>PayPal always had a reputation for its P2P payments through third-party platforms like eBay. Although now they’re taking aim at providing more services for ecommerce sites. Stripe has always been known for ecommerce solutions, but not offers POS solutions as well.</p>
<p>Both of these companies have the tools, services, and resources you need to run an ecommerce shop. They both have exceptional online reviews as well.</p>
<p>PayPal is the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2411/paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular digital wallet</a> in the United States and is the most popular mobile payment method in North America. There are more than 277 million PayPal users worldwide.</p>
<p>Based on these numbers, I’d have to give the edge to PayPal in terms of reputation. But by no means am I saying that Stripe doesn’t have an excellent reputation as well.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you have an ecommerce shop and you’re trying to figure out the best payment service provider, both PayPal and Stripe are top options to consider.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s going to come down to personal preference. Based on the information I gave you above, you can decide which plan meets your needs the most.</p>
<p>I can’t definitively give an edge to one platform over the other. I’d strongly recommend both options.</p>
<p>For those of you who still aren’t sold on PayPal or Stripe, you can review my guide on the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-payment-methods-for-your-ecommerce-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best payment methods for your ecommerce site</a> to find some alternative solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re on the hunt for a new web hosting service, <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10192/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost</a> is definitely a top option to consider. This platform powers more than 2 million sites across the globe.</p>
<p>All web hosting services are not created equally.</p>
<p>I see so many new webmasters make the mistake of just going with the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-cheap-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheapest web host</a> or the web hosting site that appears first in their Google search results.</p>
<p>For something as important as web hosting, you can’t rush this decision. It’s crucial that you take the time to weigh your options in order to find the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best web hosting plan</a> for your needs.</p>
<p>That’s what inspired me to write this guide. Since so many of you will likely come across Bluehost during your search, I wanted to give you as much information about this web hosting service as possible.</p>
<p>I’ll explain all of their hosting plans, pricing, and discuss the best parts about using Bluehost. I’ll even tell you about a couple of cons associated with Bluehost, just to make sure you have all the facts before you sign up.</p>
<p><span id="more-43781"></span></p>
<h3>Bluehost Web Hosting Plans</h3>
<p>Not every website has the same web hosting needs. Bluehost knows this and has three different types of web hosting options for you to choose from.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared</li>
<li>VPS (virtual private server)</li>
<li>Dedicated server</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing which kind of web hosting plan to go with will vary based on how much you want to pay, your expected site traffic, and the type of website you have. If these terms are foreign to you, I recommend reading my guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/everything-about-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything you need to know about web hosting</a>. This will give you a more detailed description of the differences between these hosting options.</p>
<h4>Shared hosting</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43782" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-shared-hosting.png" alt="Bluehost shared hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-shared-hosting.png 1706w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-shared-hosting-300x81.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-shared-hosting-768x207.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-shared-hosting-1024x276.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1706px) 100vw, 1706px" /></p>
<p>If you have a new website and you’re on a tight budget, shared hosting might be your best option. Bluehost offers four different pricing plans for its shared hosting services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic — $3.95 per month</li>
<li>Plus — $5.95 per month</li>
<li>Choice Plus — $5.95 per month</li>
<li>Pro — $13.95 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>I know what some of you are thinking. If Plus and Choice Plus are priced the same, wouldn’t you automatically go with Choice Plus?</p>
<p>All Bluehost plans go up in price once you renew. The advertised prices above are just the introductory rates. It’s worth noting that Plus renews at $10.99 per month, while Choice Plus renews at $14.99 per month.</p>
<p>Bluehost has managed shared hosting platforms, meaning you won’t have to worry about managing servers or anything like that.</p>
<h4>VPS hosting</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43784" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-VPS-hosting.png" alt="Bluehost VPS hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-VPS-hosting.png 1590w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-VPS-hosting-300x106.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-VPS-hosting-768x271.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-VPS-hosting-1024x362.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1590px) 100vw, 1590px" /></p>
<p>VPS hosting from Bluehost is the middle-tier option of the three plans. There are three pricing options for a Bluehost virtual private server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard — $19.99 per month</li>
<li>Enhanced — $29.99 per month</li>
<li>Ultimate — $59.99 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest differences in these plans are the cores, SSD storage, RAM, bandwidth, and IP addresses.</p>
<p>With the Standard plan, you’ll get 1 core, 30 GB of SSD storage, 2 GB of RAM, 1 TB of bandwidth, and 1 IP address. Cores, SSD storage, and RAM double at each tier for the Enhanced and Ultimate packages.</p>
<p>Using Bluehost for a VPS gives you dedicated server resources. You’ll be able to use your RAM, CPU, and disk space, no matter what other users on the same server are doing. VPS hosting also has increased security, since you won’t be sharing an operating system with any other Bluehost users.</p>
<h4>Dedicated hosting</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43786" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-dedicated-hosting.png" alt="Bluehost dedicated hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-dedicated-hosting.png 1758w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-dedicated-hosting-300x77.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-dedicated-hosting-768x198.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-dedicated-hosting-1024x264.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1758px) 100vw, 1758px" /></p>
<p>Picking a dedicated server plan from Bluehost means you’ll be taking advantage of their top of the line services. These plans are made for those of you who are tech-savvy and want complete control over your server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard — $79.99 per month</li>
<li>Enhanced — $99.99 per month</li>
<li>Premium — $119.99 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, top-tier plans come at higher price points. With VPS hosting, you’re maxed out at 120 GB of SSD storage, 8 GB of RAM, 3 TB of bandwidth, and 2 IP addresses. But dedicated servers from Bluehost go all the way up to 1 TB of storage, 16 GB of RAM, 15 TB of bandwidth, and 5 IP addresses.</p>
<p>These plans will probably exceed the needs and uses for what most of you are looking for. But with that said, as your website grows and your traffic scales, you might want to consider a dedicated server in the future.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Bluehost for web hosting</h3>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of the plans offered by Bluehost, it’s time for us to discuss what makes Bluehost a great choice for web hosting.</p>
<h4>Low pricing options</h4>
<p>If you have a brand new website, you don’t need to be spending thousands of dollars per year on web hosting. With Bluehost, you won’t have too.</p>
<p>As you’ve already seen, the introductory rates for Bluehost shared web hosting starts at just $3.95 per month. Being able to host your site for less than $50 is a great deal.</p>
<p>All Bluehost shared hosting plans come with a free SSL certificate and free marketing credits. When you factor in the storage and bandwidth you’re getting, that’s a fairly decent value for the price.</p>
<p>Overall, this is one of the lowest prices you’ll see for a legitimate web host.</p>
<h4>Great security</h4>
<p>Even though Bluehost has some inexpensive pricing options compared to other web hosts on the market today, it doesn’t mean that they’re inferior when it comes to crucial security features.</p>
<p>I’ve already mentioned that an SSL certificate comes standard, regardless of which plan you choose.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their plans have a feature to hide the personal information that you used when signing up for a private domain. Lots of times hackers will target this information from website owners.</p>
<p>Bluehost has features to prevent malware attacks, as well as tools used for automatic daily backups. You’ll also get a security tool that offers spam protection for the email address associated with your website.</p>
<p>Again, this is all a great value considering how much these plans go for.</p>
<h4>Top loading speeds</h4>
<p>Page loading speed is something that always needs to be taken into consideration when you’re shopping around for the best website host.</p>
<p>If your site takes too long to load, it’s going to kill your engagement metrics. People will abandon your site, and you won’t be able to drive conversions. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look the <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/zp1kq4gopbjs/3292804/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">response time</a> for a Bluehost test website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43787" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-response-time.png" alt="Bluehost response time" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-response-time.png 1794w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-response-time-300x107.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-response-time-768x275.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-response-time-1024x366.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1794px) 100vw, 1794px" /></p>
<p>The average response time for Bluehost so far in 2019 is 352 ms. To put that into perspective, refer to my <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/siteground-web-hosting-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround web hosting review</a>. SiteGround’s average response time over the same period of time was 662 ms, which is still fast.</p>
<p>Bluehost nearly cuts that time in half.</p>
<h4>Easy to use</h4>
<p>You don’t need to be a tech expert to host your website with Bluehost. Nearly anyone, regardless of their experience level, can find a beginner hosting plan from this platform.</p>
<p>That’s definitely not the case with all web hosting providers on the market today. There are plenty of web hosts out there that are specifically designed for advanced webmasters.</p>
<p>Whether you’re using WordPress or taking advantage of the Bluehost <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-website-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website builder</a>, everything will be pretty straightforward and easy to follow.</p>
<h4>Excellent support</h4>
<p>Even though Bluehost is easy to figure out, you may still find yourself in a situation where you need some help or guidance.</p>
<p>In most cases, you should able to find an answer through their knowledge base page. This is essentially a support center that has how-to guides, tutorials, and articles with instructions for troubleshooting and FAQ. Simply search what you’re looking for, and there will likely be a resource to help you out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bluehost has 24/7 phone support, which is great for those of you who like to be talked through problems.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you’ll probably just take advantage of their live chat agents. It’s a fast and easy way to get an answer without having to leave their website.</p>
<h4>High uptimes</h4>
<p>You can’t give a web hosting review without referring to uptime rates. Take a look at where Bluehost stacks up compared to other web hosting providers in this <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/average-hosting-uptime-study/">recent study.</a></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43788" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-uptimes.png" alt="Bluehost uptimes" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-uptimes.png 1436w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-uptimes-300x106.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-uptimes-768x272.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-uptimes-1024x362.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /></p>
<p>Bluehost ranked second on the list with a 99.991% average uptime for the year. That percentage is identical to MidPhase, which ranked first on the list.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can see that Bluehost only had seven total outages on the year, which was the lowest for all hosts in the top five, including the top-ranking provider on the list.</p>
<p>It really doesn’t get much better than that. So if you host your website with Bluehost, you can rest assured knowing that your site isn’t going to have much downtime throughout the year.</p>
<h4>Money-back guarantee</h4>
<p>Like most web hosting services, you won’t get a free trial to try them out. But with that said, Bluehost does offer a 30-day money-back promise.</p>
<p>So if you’re on the fence about using Bluehost, it’s comforting to know that you’ll get refunded if you’re not ultimately satisfied in the first month.</p>
<p>But with that said, it’s worth noting that the refund only applies to web hosting costs. So if you use Bluehost for a domain name or other add-ons, those purchases are final.</p>
<h4>WordPress hosting</h4>
<p>If you’re using WordPress, Bluehost is definitely a top option for you to consider. That’s because this web host is just one of the three “official” recommended choices from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/">WordPress website</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43789" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-Wordpress-hosting.png" alt="Bluehost WordPress hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-Wordpress-hosting.png 1952w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-Wordpress-hosting-300x173.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-Wordpress-hosting-768x444.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bluehost-Wordpress-hosting-1024x592.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1952px) 100vw, 1952px" /></p>
<p>DreamHost and SiteGround are the other two recommended web hosting services on this WordPress resource.</p>
<p>With that said, you can still use nearly any other web hosting service on the market to create your WordPress website. But it’s definitely a positive sign that Bluehost is recognized as a WordPress partner.</p>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>While Bluehost has its fair share of positive characteristics, it’s still not perfect. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention some of the shortcomings of this web host.</p>
<h4>High renewal rates</h4>
<p>I briefly mentioned this before when we were discussing the different plans and pricing options. Like many other web hosting services, Bluehost jacks up the prices once you renew your subscription.</p>
<p>Depending on your plan, the monthly rate will change as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3.95 to $7.99</li>
<li>$5.95 to $10.99</li>
<li>$5.95 to $14.99</li>
<li>$13.95 to $23.99</li>
<li>$19.99 to $29.99</li>
<li>$29.99 to $59.99</li>
<li>$59.99 to $119.99</li>
<li>$79.99 to $119.99</li>
<li>$99.99 to $159.99</li>
<li>$119.99 to $209.99</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see from this list, in some instances the price more than doubles. So it’s in your best interest to commit to a longer term plan if you want to get the best rate for the longest amount of time.</p>
<p>Bluehost offers plans for 12, 24, or 36 months. So if you know that you’re ready to commit to this web host, I’d recommend going with a three-year contract when you first sign up. It will save you money down the road.</p>
<h4>Costly site migrations</h4>
<p>It seems like the majority of web hosting services out there will migrate your current website to their service at no cost. This is a major selling point for new customers.</p>
<p>However, Bluehost does not offer free website migrations.</p>
<p>For $149.99 they’ll migrate up to five websites and 20 email accounts. This gets handled by experts at Bluehost, so you won’t have to do any heavy lifting.</p>
<p>But with that said, you do have to pay for it, which can be a turn-off for those of you with an existing site.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Simply put, I definitely recommend <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10192/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost</a> as a web hosting provider. There’s a reason why it’s one of the most popular services on the market today.</p>
<p>Bluehost has exceptionally fast loading times as well as one of the highest uptime rates we’ve seen in the last year.</p>
<p>They offer different hosting types, plans, and options to meet the needs of any website. I’m sure you’ll be able to find a plan from Bluehost that is suitable for your web hosting needs.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone’s heard of “the cloud.”</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the cloud refers to remote storage. For example, you can store pictures from your smartphone or documents on your computer to a cloud storage space like Google Drive.</p>
<p>This is different than storing files locally on something like an external hard drive. I’m sure you’re familiar with both of these scenarios, and you probably even use cloud storage for something in your digital life.</p>
<p>Now when it comes to web hosting, the cloud is a little bit more in depth, but the same principles still apply.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics. There are four main types of web hosting:</p>
<p><span id="more-43743"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Shared hosting</li>
<li>VPS (virtual private server) hosting</li>
<li>Dedicated server hosting</li>
<li>Cloud hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>To fully understand the differences between all of these options, refer to my guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/everything-about-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything you need to know about web hosting</a>.</p>
<p>But right now I want to put the primary focus on cloud hosting. Although it’s the newest way to host websites, the method has been <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/500541/worldwide-hosting-and-cloud-computing-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing in popularity</a> over the years.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43748" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cloud-Hosting-Popularity-Chart.png" alt="Cloud Hosting Popularity Chart" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cloud-Hosting-Popularity-Chart.png 1378w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cloud-Hosting-Popularity-Chart-300x223.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cloud-Hosting-Popularity-Chart-768x571.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cloud-Hosting-Popularity-Chart-1024x761.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1378px) 100vw, 1378px" /></p>
<p>This graph shows the cloud computing and cloud hosting market on a global scale in billions of dollars.</p>
<p>While cloud hosting has been around for years, not many people know exactly how it is and how it works. So what is cloud hosting?</p>
<p>Basically, your web host isn’t connected to one physical location. That’s not the case with shared hosting, VPS, and dedicated servers.</p>
<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of cloud hosting, I’ll cover the benefits. You can use this guide as a resource to determine if cloud hosting is the best option for your website.</p>
<h3>Easy to scale</h3>
<p>Traditionally, when you’re picking a web host you need to have some idea of the type of website traffic you’re planning to get. This makes it easier for you to pick a plan to fit your needs.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that you <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get a web hosting plan</a> with enough bandwidth, storage, and disc space.</p>
<p>But there is a common dilemma that new websites are faced with all of the time. They have to decide if they want to get the highest possible bandwidth, even if they probably won’t come close to exceeding those limits. Or should they start with a lower bandwidth plan and upgrade as their traffic starts to increase?</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to each approach.</p>
<p>One the one hand, a top-tier plan will come at a premium price. You’ll end up paying for a service that you won’t need until your site grows. But the second option will cause slower page loading times as your website scales until you upgrade.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting solves those problems.</p>
<p>Since your website is hosted on multiple remote servers, you won’t have to worry about exceeding bandwidth. If one server is maxed out, you can always pull resources from another.</p>
<p>All of this can be easily managed and configured in-real time. Here’s what that looks like if you’re using <a href="https://support.hostgator.com/articles/hosting-guide/lets-get-started/cloud-sites-server-usage-dashboard">HostGator</a> for cloud storage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43749" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Cloud-Hosting.png" alt="Hostgator Cloud Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Cloud-Hosting.png 922w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Cloud-Hosting-300x191.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-Cloud-Hosting-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" /></p>
<p>Cloud hosting allows you to scale your server without having to get approval from the hosting provider, which you’d need with VPS, shared, or dedicated hosting.</p>
<h3>Flexible pricing</h3>
<p>If you use a traditional web hosting server, you’re going to a pay a fixed monthly rate based on the plan that you sign up for. You’ll be charged this amount even if you don’t actually use all of the resources on that server.</p>
<p>But cloud hosting is priced based on what you actually use.</p>
<p>Here’s an analogy. Let’s say you go to an all you can eat buffet, where the food options can also be purchased à la carte. The buffet price is $20 per person. So that’s the most you’ll have to pay, regardless of how much food you eat.</p>
<p>But if you only eat $10 worth of food, then you’ll only be charged $10 for that meal.</p>
<p>That’s how pricing is structured for cloud hosting.</p>
<p>The pricing also relates back to our previous point about being able to scale your resources on demand. For example, let’s say you just built a bunch of new backlinks and you’re expecting a particular <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/the-anatomy-of-virality-how-to-engineer-the-perfect-viral-blog-article/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on your site to go viral</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than upgrading your entire plan (which you’d have to do with another hosting option), you can just increase the resources needed during that traffic spike. Then you can put everything back to normal when your traffic levels out.</p>
<p>In this case, you’d only pay for the server usage that was actually being used during the surge.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the pricing page for <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/computing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost</a> cloud hosting plans.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43751" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Cloud-Hosting.png" alt="DreamHost Cloud Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Cloud-Hosting.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Cloud-Hosting-300x154.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Cloud-Hosting-768x395.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DreamHost-Cloud-Hosting-1024x527.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, pricing is based on usage. Each plan has a maximum monthly rate. Even the fine print at the bottom of the page states that you’ll only be billed for what you use.</p>
<p>This type of pricing structure is standard for most cloud hosting services across the board.</p>
<h3>Reliable servers</h3>
<p>As I’ve previously explained, other types of web hosting options rely on a singular server.</p>
<p>So if something happens to the server that your site is hosted on, then your site would be offline until the server was back up and running. You’re essentially putting all of your eggs in one basket. This can be a huge risk when you’re talking about something as important as your website.</p>
<p>But cloud hosting uses multiple remote servers and resources.</p>
<p>If something happens to one, the others will still be able to host your site. This means that your website will have high uptime and availability rates.</p>
<p>In addition to potential problems with one server, cloud hosting will keep your site stable, even as traffic increases. We discussed this before when we covered the ability for you to pull resources from multiple servers to manage your site.</p>
<p>Cloud hosting is also extremely easy to set up.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to start hosting on the cloud right away, it can be a faster deployment option than something like a dedicated server or shared server.</p>
<h3>Speed and performance</h3>
<p>The majority of cloud hosting servers will provide lightning fast speed. They also increase the capacity of your website, which boosts your page loading speed.</p>
<p>That’s because all of your content will get loaded from multiple server environments.</p>
<p>This approach doesn’t put as much strain on a singular server, the way it would if you had a dedicated, shared, or VPS plan. If your website has lots of resource-intensive data such as videos, images, sound, and other media content, this is something that you need to prioritize.</p>
<p>Another benefit of cloud hosting is that content can be delivered from the nearest remote server, which is another reason why loading times are so fast.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, your website visitors don’t care what type of web hosting you’re using. They just want your site to be responsive and load quickly. That’s why your loading times will have such a major impact on <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/speed-up-your-website/">conversion rates</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43752" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Loding-Time-Conversion-Rates.png" alt="Loding Time Conversion Rates" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Loding-Time-Conversion-Rates.png 1482w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Loding-Time-Conversion-Rates-300x135.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Loding-Time-Conversion-Rates-768x345.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Loding-Time-Conversion-Rates-1024x460.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1482px) 100vw, 1482px" /></p>
<p>By prioritizing page loading speed with cloud hosting, your website will ultimately perform better from the user end.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Cloud hosting is very safe from a security standpoint. Here’s why.</p>
<p>Your website is isolated from any potential problems with a physical server. That’s because everything is handled remotely. This won’t be the case if you’re relying on a singular dedicated server that’s hosted locally.</p>
<p>If a local server was compromised, then your website would be at risk. You won’t need to worry about that happening with cloud hosting.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say something went wrong with one of the servers in your cloud hosting network. Maybe it was hacked, had a system overload, or hardware failure.</p>
<p>Your site would be fine because it could just continue using one of the many other remote servers in the network. Everything would stay up and running without any downtime or delays.</p>
<h3>Best cloud hosting services</h3>
<p>Now that you know the top benefits of cloud hosting, I want to show some of the best cloud hosting services available on the market today.</p>
<h4>SiteGround</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43753" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground.png" alt="Siteground" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-300x85.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-768x217.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-1024x289.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround</a> is second to none in terms of reliability for cloud hosting. Their team fully manages your cloud, so you won’t have to worry about any maintenance for your hosting.</p>
<p>SiteGround guarantees that you’ll have enough resources on the cloud to power your site. It will be fully optimized in terms of speed and efficiency based on your traffic and usage.</p>
<p>Their platform makes it easy for you to add RAM or CPU on-demand with just one click. SiteGround also has an auto-scale feature, which adds sufficient resources to your site in times of where traffic spikes. I would definitely take advantage of this. That way you won’t have to manually add resources and track your traffic.</p>
<p>Your cloud service with SiteGround also comes with powerful tools like a dedicated IP, free Cloudflare CDN, free SSL, private DNS, and daily backups.</p>
<p>SiteGround cloud hosting plans start at $60, $120, and $160 per month.</p>
<h4>HostGator</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43754" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator.png" alt="Hostgator" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-300x83.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-768x213.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hostgator-1024x284.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10189/">HostGator</a> has unmetered bandwidth and storage for all of their cloud hosting plans.</p>
<p>They offer automatic daily backups as well as daily scans to protect your site from hackers, viruses, and malware. Their cloud system has integrated caching to ensure that your pages always load as fast as possible.</p>
<p>HostGator’s intuitive dashboard makes it easy for anyone, regardless of their tech background, to manage the performance of a website. You’ll also be able to appropriately allocate any additional resources that your site requires based on usage and traffic.</p>
<p>HostGator cloud hosting plans start at $4.95, $6.57, and $9.95 per month.</p>
<h4>DreamHost</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43755" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost.png" alt="Dreamhost" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-300x93.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-768x238.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dreamhost-1024x317.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10189/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost</a> is a great option for those of you who are price-sensitive. They offer plans that are are charged strictly based on usage. The maximum you’d pay each month is either $4.50, $12, or $48, depending on the plan you choose.</p>
<p>You’ll have full root access and control over your cloud servers, so there are no restrictions for software or operating systems.</p>
<p>The only downside of DreamHost is that they don’t offer live chat and phone support. But since their platform is so straightforward and easy to use, I’m willing to look past that for the bargain rates.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Cloud hosting is growing in popularity. It’s become a reliable and flexible way to host websites in the modern digital era.</p>
<p>There are lots of great benefits to cloud hosting. I highlighted the top ones in this guide.</p>
<p>Overall, cloud hosting should be taken into consideration if you have a website that’s growing. The flexibility of the resources and pricing structures ensure that your site will have high uptime rates and fast loading speeds, even during unexpected traffic surges.</p>
<p>But with that said, cloud hosting isn’t necessarily for everyone. If you have an ecommerce website that always has high traffic and want to make changes to your server based on the software you’re using, you might be better off with a dedicated server.</p>
<p>For those of you who think cloud hosting is right for your website, I’d recommend using one of the three options that I covered in this guide.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing has arguably become the biggest buzzword in the marketing industry today.</p>
<p>It seems like you can’t have a conversation with a business owner who has an online presence without the term being brought up. Every online “expert” claims to hold the secret to content marketing.</p>
<p>But the reality is this. Like most marketing strategies, what works for one business won’t necessarily work for another. Content marketing campaigns will vary by industry as well.</p>
<p>So what exactly is content marketing?</p>
<p>By definition, it’s the process of creating and distributing digital materials online to directly or indirectly promote a brand, product, or service.</p>
<p>But that definition is so broad. To have a successful content marketing strategy as an ecommerce website, you need to take an ecommerce-specific approach.</p>
<p><span id="more-43746"></span></p>
<p>Your content strategy won’t be the same as a B2B SaaS company or a B2C local retailer without an online presence.</p>
<p>I’ve seen countless ecommerce sites get so caught up in their marketing plan, that they actually lose sight of what drives their business. Rather than trying to copy the content strategy of a competitor (who may or may not have a good approach) you should be focusing on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/the-best-ways-to-boost-ecommerce-sales-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ecommerce conversions</a>.</p>
<p>Everything you do needs to drive conversions. That’s the ultimate way to survive as an ecommerce shop.</p>
<p>So if you can’t directly or indirectly connect conversions to your content strategy, then it’s a wasted effort. That’s what inspired me to create this guide.</p>
<p>I want to clear up any misconceptions that you might have about content marketing and how it works. I’ve outlined a straightforward content marketing approach that’s specifically designed for ecommerce shops.</p>
<h3>Ecommerce content marketing process</h3>
<p>Before you start blogging or uploading videos to YouTube, you need to establish a clear plan for your content strategy. Remember, everything you do ultimately needs to drive conversions.</p>
<p>This is something that I encounter all of the time when I’m consulting with ecommerce companies.</p>
<p>They start to tell me about their plan, which sounds great in theory, but they don’t know the “why” behind the strategy.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re putting all of your efforts into advertising on LinkedIn. You saw some information online about how many users are on the platform and how much it’s been growing over the years. Must be a good place to deploy a content marketing campaign, right?</p>
<p>For some businesses, sure. But that’s not the case for ecommerce.</p>
<p>You would know this if you took the time to create a plan before putting a strategy in motion. I’ve simplified the planning process into three easy steps. It’s crucial that you follow them in order.</p>
<h4>Step #1: Identify your target audience</h4>
<p>I know this may sound simple, but you’d be surprised at how many people don’t know the answer to this question. Take a moment to see if you really know your target audience.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Your target audience needs to be crystal clear before every content marketing campaign. Otherwise, it won’t have a high success rate and lead to conversions.</p>
<p>Without knowing your target audience, you won’t know how to reach them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Likes</li>
<li>Dislikes</li>
<li>Habits</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the basics that you need to know, at a minimum. <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-identify-the-target-market-of-your-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying the target market of your startup</a> is something that you should have done a long time ago. But your overall audience isn’t always the same for individual campaigns and strategies.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say your company sells sports equipment online. Your audience isn’t just “people who play sports.”</p>
<p>You can’t tailor your content around that because it’s way too broad. High school softball players aren’t the same as middle-aged male golfers.</p>
<h4>Step #2: Learn their online habits</h4>
<p>Remember, content marketing is all about distributing digital touchpoints online. That’s why it’s so important to figure out who your audience is.</p>
<p>You need to know where these people <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/social-media-usage-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live online</a>. Otherwise, you won’t know how or where to distribute the right content.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43756" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Composition-of-Social-Media-Brand-Users.png" alt="Composition of Social Media Brand Users" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Composition-of-Social-Media-Brand-Users.png 1214w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Composition-of-Social-Media-Brand-Users-300x148.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Composition-of-Social-Media-Brand-Users-768x380.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Composition-of-Social-Media-Brand-Users-1024x506.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1214px) 100vw, 1214px" /></p>
<p>Social media is a great way to distribute your content. Here’s a basic breakdown of social media usage based on age.</p>
<p>This will tell you more about your target audience, but it’s still not enough information.</p>
<p>Sure, based on this graph, you could eliminate the possibility of targeting users over the age of 55 on Instagram and Snapchat since they only make up 9% and 6% of the population on those platforms, respectively.</p>
<p>However, other times broad information like this can be misleading. Take a look at the Snapchat usage. 76% of Snapchat users fall between the ages of 12 and 34.</p>
<p>So if you’re targeting younger consumers, like Millennials or Generation Z, this might seem like the place to do it. But you need to learn their habits as well.</p>
<p>For simplicity sake, let’s continue using the example from before. You have an ecommerce sports shop, and you’re trying to sell equipment to high school softball players.</p>
<p>If you assume that Snapchat is the best place to distribute your content, you’re making a mistake. You haven’t done all of the research yet.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://genhq.com/what-are-generation-zs-social-media-preferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">49% of Generation Z females</a> say that they prefer to use Snapchat for sending videos of themselves. 43% of that same group says they prefer using Snapchat for posting selfies. They don’t use this platform to interact with brands.</p>
<p>However, 48% of Generation Z females say that Instagram is their preferred social media network for following brands.</p>
<p>Even though Snapchat has a greater marketing penetration of your target audience, it doesn’t matter if they’re not using that platform to interact with businesses online.</p>
<p>You can’t make assumptions about habits. I alluded to this earlier about LinkedIn. While your customers may be using the platform, that network is designed for B2B marketing, not B2C ecommerce shops.</p>
<h4>Step #3: Create and distribute content</h4>
<p>Once you figure out what platforms are the best places to distribute content for your previously identified target audience, now you can start to create content.</p>
<p>If you start building the content before you go through the first two steps, it’s a big mistake. You might be wasting your time creating content that people won’t end up seeing or using.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re spending 90% of your content marketing resources on blogging. But your audience is consuming content on YouTube and Instagram. That’s not an efficient use of your resources.</p>
<p>The type of content you create will also depend on who you’re targeting people based on their stage in the <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/content-marketing-funnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing funnel</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43757" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png" alt="Content Marketing Funnel" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Content-Marketing-Funnel.png 1416w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Content-Marketing-Funnel-300x215.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Content-Marketing-Funnel-768x551.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Content-Marketing-Funnel-1024x735.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1416px) 100vw, 1416px" /></p>
<p>This graphic is a great resource to give you inspiration for content ideas.</p>
<p>A consumer who has never heard of your brand or ecommerce site will be targeted differently than repeat customer who knows what they’re looking for and is ready to make a purchase.</p>
<p>Breaking this entire process down into these three steps simplifies content marketing for ecommerce brands. But if you mix up the order of these steps, it won’t be as effective.</p>
<h3>Types of ecommerce content marketing</h3>
<p>Now that you understand the approach behind content marketing for ecommerce sites, it’s time to look at some more specific types of content that you can use for your campaigns.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, not all of these will be applicable for every campaign you run. The content will always vary and be based on who you’re targeting and the platforms you’re planning to distribute on.</p>
<h4>Blogging</h4>
<p>I always recommend starting your content marketing strategy with blogging. While this may not be the most popular approach for ecommerce companies, it’s very beneficial in terms of SEO.</p>
<p>There are ways for you to <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-scale-your-lead-generation-through-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scale your lead generation through blogging</a> as well.</p>
<p>Let me show you an example from <a href="https://www.getvinebox.com/blogs/learn/why-you-should-be-drinking-organic-wine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vinebox</a>, an ecommerce store that sells wine.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43758" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vinebox.png" alt="Vinebox" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vinebox.png 1602w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vinebox-300x245.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vinebox-768x626.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Vinebox-1024x835.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1602px) 100vw, 1602px" /></p>
<p>Here’s a blog post I pulled from their site about the benefits of drinking organic wine.</p>
<p>So if someone is browsing online and searching for more information about organic wine, how it works, and the effect it has on their body, this post can pop up. People can navigate to this website even if they never heard of Vinebox.</p>
<p>As an ecommerce shop, you’re competing with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of other brands across the web. You can’t rely on all of your customers going directly to your site to buy.</p>
<p>While this page serves as an informational guide on organic wine, it’s also designed for conversions.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43759" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Design-for-conversions.png" alt="Design for conversions" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Design-for-conversions.png 1372w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Design-for-conversions-300x161.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Design-for-conversions-768x413.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Design-for-conversions-1024x551.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" /></p>
<p>This is the final section of the blog post.</p>
<p>The blog closes with two CTAs about buying organic wine directly through their website. It’s a simple, yet effective approach.</p>
<p>You can definitely mimic this strategy for blog posts related to the products you’re selling online.</p>
<h4>Original photos</h4>
<p>The biggest challenge of selling online is that customers can’t touch and feel what you’re offering before they buy it.</p>
<p>They rely heavily on visuals for this. So it’s up to you to ensure that you have tons of pictures of your products from nearly every imaginable angle. This is necessary for your product pages, but you can also repurpose those images on other channels as well.</p>
<p>For example, you can take an original photo of a model wearing the clothes that you’re selling and turn it into an <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/shoppable-posts-on-instagram-for-ecommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram shoppable post</a>.</p>
<p>Again, this is only under the assumption that you’ve done the right research and recognized this platform as a place to reach your target audience.</p>
<p>Include photos in your blogs. Add them to your email campaigns. Share them on other social media channels. Keep taking original photos because you’ll always be able to find a use for them.</p>
<h4>Video content</h4>
<p>This piggybacks off of my last point about how consumers need to see your products before they buy anything.</p>
<p>Images are somewhat limited, but videos can tell the full story. Just look at how big of an impact <a href="https://marketingland.com/retailers-using-product-videos-report-much-higher-aov-conversion-rates-113436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video content</a> has on purchases.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43760" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Video-Content.png" alt="Video Content" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Video-Content.png 994w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Video-Content-300x187.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Video-Content-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" /></p>
<p>The more videos people watch about a product online, the higher their average order value is.</p>
<p>Videos can also be repurposed across multiple channels. Your blog, product pages, email campaigns, and social media profiles are all great places to distribute.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90% of consumers</a> say that videos assist their buying decisions. 54% of consumers want to see more video content from brands they support. Videos on landing pages can increase conversions by up to 80%.</p>
<p>Just adding the word “video” to an email subject line can increase your open rates by 19%.</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to” videos</li>
<li>Product demonstrations</li>
<li>Brand advertisements</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Live video broadcasts</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of possibilities goes on and on. Video content must be incorporated into marketing strategies for all ecommerce sites.</p>
<h4>Product buying guides</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/2019/01/04/how-to-generate-ecommerce-sales-with-product-buying-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product buying guides</a> are essential for the same reason as blogs. They can be used to drive organic traffic to your ecommerce site when people are looking for more information about specific products.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between product buying guides and blogging is that they will each target different types of people.</p>
<p>Blog posts are typically ToFu (top of funnel) content since the consumer is still in the product and brand awareness stage. On the other hand, product buying guides are MoFu (middle of funnel) content as the consumer reaches the evaluation stage of the purchase process.</p>
<p>Make sure that all of your buying guides have CTAs to drive conversions.</p>
<h4>Email marketing</h4>
<p>Truthfully, email marketing isn’t just an ecommerce-specific content marketing strategy.</p>
<p>But with that said, there are definitely ways that your ecommerce shop can leverage emails that other businesses cannot. Here’s a look at how <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2018_B2C_Research_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2C marketers</a> are using email marketing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43761" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2C-email-marketing.png" alt="B2C email marketing" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2C-email-marketing.png 1090w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2C-email-marketing-300x165.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2C-email-marketing-768x421.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2C-email-marketing-1024x562.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px" /></p>
<p>Your ecommerce site can take this to the next level.</p>
<p>Any time someone makes a purchase on your website, you have the opportunity to send them a drip campaign that’s relevant to that order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Order confirmation</li>
<li>Shipping notification</li>
<li>Package delivered</li>
<li>Follow up</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s four emails that you have an excuse to send. All of them are relevant to the customer and provide information that they want to see.</p>
<p>You can use these messages to drive more conversions. Provide discount codes off of an upcoming purchase. Show product recommendations based on what they bought.</p>
<p>If a customer buys a surfboard, send them an email about a wetsuit. If they buy workout shorts, send them an email about more new workout gear.</p>
<h4>Customer stories</h4>
<p>There are lots of different formats you can use to tell a customer story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Testimonials</li>
<li>Case studies</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be in text format, image format, videos, or blog posts. Display them on your homepage. Create separate landing pages for customer stories. Share them on social media.</p>
<p>If you look back to the content marketing funnel that we talked about earlier, customer stories fall into the BoFu (bottom of funnel) category.</p>
<p>At this point, the consumer is close to converting. The customer stories can be the factor that drives them to complete the purchase process.</p>
<h4>Interactive content</h4>
<p>Adding interactivity to your content strategy is a great way to bring a personalized touch to the customer.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from the <a href="https://www.beardbrand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beardbrand</a> website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43762" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Beardbrand.png" alt="Beardbrand" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Beardbrand.png 1992w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Beardbrand-300x137.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Beardbrand-768x351.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Beardbrand-1024x468.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1992px) 100vw, 1992px" /></p>
<p>When you land on their homepage, you aren’t shown any specific products, and they don’t have any CTAs saying something like “buy now.”</p>
<p>Instead, there is an original photo of three men, each with three very different beards. There is a link to a quiz that will “help you find the perfect product.”</p>
<p>This interactive quiz makes the customer feel confident about the product that they’re purchasing. By answering a series of questions designed to meet their needs, it gives them an incentive to buy.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are lots of misconceptions about content marketing and how it works. As an ecommerce business, you need to look for strategies that are specific to your industry.</p>
<p>Before you do anything, you need to know the process for ecommerce content marketing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify your audience</li>
<li>Find out how to reach them online</li>
<li>Create content and distribute them on those platforms</li>
</ol>
<p>When you take this approach, everything else gets easier. Just remember that every content strategy you apply needs to ultimately drive conversions.</p>
<p>Keep this guide as a reference, and use the examples I listed above as inspiration for some high-converting content strategies.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t matter what type of business you have or what industry you’re in; everyone needs to incorporate email campaigns into their marketing strategy.</p>
<p>There’s a common misconception that email marketing is dead. That’s just simply not the case.</p>
<p>So for those of you who are struggling with your email strategy, there’s a good chance that you’re making some mistakes. Don’t get me wrong—I’m not saying this to discourage you.</p>
<p>This is actually good news. All this means is that you need to make some adjustments with your approach to have more success.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why email marketing is so useful is because it delivers a <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high ROI</a>.  For every $1 you spend on email campaigns, you can expect an average return of $32.</p>
<p>81% of small business owners say they rely on email as their primary customer acquisition method. Additionally, 80% of small businesses say that email marketing is their primary method for customer retention as well.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve been having decent success with your email marketing campaigns in the past, you can still benefit from this guide.</p>
<p><span id="more-43744"></span></p>
<p>Without even realizing it, you might be making mistakes that are holding you back. So if you’re ready to take your email strategy to the next level, review and correct these eight mistakes that should be avoided at all costs.</p>
<h3>1. Not welcoming your subscribers</h3>
<p>You just added a new subscriber to your email list. That’s great news!</p>
<p>This person was navigating through your website, made their way to a landing page, saw your email value proposition, and filled out the form fields required to sign up. They took a lot of steps, so clearly they’re interested in your website and brand.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>If you’re not planning to contact them until you send your next newsletter or coupon, then you’re making a big mistake. Welcome emails should be triggered immediately after a sign-up. That’s because they have the <a href="https://www.dyspatch.io/resources/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highest open rates</a> compared to every other email category.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43763" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Email-Open-Rates-by-Category.png" alt="Email Open Rates by Category" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Email-Open-Rates-by-Category.png 1308w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Email-Open-Rates-by-Category-300x183.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Email-Open-Rates-by-Category-768x470.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Email-Open-Rates-by-Category-1024x626.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1308px) 100vw, 1308px" /></p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense. Think about it for a second.</p>
<p>Why did this person sign up?</p>
<p>Maybe you have an ecommerce shop and you promised something along the lines of exclusive discounts or offers for people who opt-in to your email list. Obviously, this visitor wants to buy something.</p>
<p>They’re on your site right now, and probably still have the browser open. But if you wait a day or a week to send that email, it’s going to be extra steps for that person to go back to your site and make a purchase. By now, the want or need for whatever you’re offering might be out of their mind.</p>
<p>On a per email basis, welcome emails generate <a href="http://respondr.io/why-welcome-emails-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">320% more revenue</a> than other marketing messages. With that in mind, you can refer to my guide on <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/2018/12/26/how-to-generate-sales-with-welcome-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to generate sales with welcome emails</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, welcome messages have a 336% higher transaction rate as well as a 196% higher click-through rate than any other email you send.</p>
<p>You need to take advantage of this. Yes, ideally you want this subscriber to be engaged with all of your emails down the road. But there’s no reason for you to wait. Get them to convert now by triggering a welcome as the first message in a drip campaign as soon as they sign up.</p>
<h3>2. Forgetting a call-to-action</h3>
<p>You think about your business and website all day, every day. Nights, weekends, holidays, it doesn’t matter; your business is always on your mind.</p>
<p>While it would be nice to think that your customers feel the same way as you do, that’s just not the case. So sending them a “hello” or “just checking in” message for no reason doesn’t add any value to their life.</p>
<p>All of your emails need to have a purpose and include a clear CTA that drives your goal home.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what do you expect the recipient to do with the message? Even if you’re sending a newsletter or some type of breaking news update, there should still be something in the message that entices conversions.</p>
<p>That’s not the only CTA mistake I see people make. On the flip side, instead of forgetting to include a CTA altogether, some site owners will go overboard and have four or five in the same message.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop now</li>
<li>Join our loyalty program</li>
<li>Forward this message to a friend</li>
<li>Share this on social media</li>
<li>Sign up for our upcoming event</li>
</ul>
<p>Alone, all of these CTAs are just fine. But when you add all of them to one message, the reader will get overwhelmed. Too many conflicting CTAs will just confuse your subscribers and end up hurting your conversion rates.</p>
<p>The content of the message should be priming and setting up the call-to-action. For example, if you’re releasing a new product, the CTA should be about buying. If you’re hosting an event, the CTA should be about signing up. For those of you who want to promote both of these, it needs to happen in two independent email campaigns.</p>
<h3>3. Sending too many emails</h3>
<p>Just because someone subscribed to your email list, it doesn’t give you the right to bombard them with messages all day.</p>
<p>The average person who works in an office receives <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/05/shocking-truth-about-how-many-emails-sent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">121 emails per day</a>. That’s more than 44,000 emails each year!</p>
<p>So it’s no surprise that the number one reason <a href="https://lab.getapp.com/new-research-getdata-why-do-people-unsubscribe-from-email-newsletters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why people unsubscribe</a> from email lists is because they get too many messages.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43765" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/why-people-unsubscribe.png" alt="why people unsubscribe" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/why-people-unsubscribe.png 1186w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/why-people-unsubscribe-300x146.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/why-people-unsubscribe-768x373.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/why-people-unsubscribe-1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1186px) 100vw, 1186px" /></p>
<p>Think about this for a moment. Put yourself in the shoes of a consumer.</p>
<p>How often do you check your emails and feel annoyed about all of the messages you have? This drives me crazy.</p>
<p>You don’t want people to have that association with your website and brand.</p>
<p>They should be happy when they get a message from you, not feel annoyed. Remember, they signed up to get messages from your website, so they obviously have some interest in your content.</p>
<p>Realistically, people aren’t going to shop every day or visit your website every day. This is something that you need to accept.</p>
<p>So I would limit your email promotions to once per week at the most.</p>
<p>You can even allow subscribers to set up their preferences when they sign up. Ask them the communication frequency that they want, as well as the type of messages that they prefer. Then segment your subscribers accordingly based on their answers.</p>
<h3>4. Not segmenting subscribers</h3>
<p>If you have one long master email list where every subscriber receives the same content at the same time, you’re doing it wrong. This is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>I just briefly explained during my last point how some people may want messages more or less frequently than others. Some subscribers may only want promotions and coupons, while others want your newsletter. Everyone has different needs and preferences.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you run an ecommerce shop. A 20-year-old male subscriber isn’t interested in the same products as a female subscriber in her 50s. So sending them the same message is not a winning strategy.</p>
<p>Take a look at how these marketing metrics increase as the result of <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/email-marketing-segmentation-mistake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segmenting emails</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43766" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segmenting-emails.png" alt="segmenting emails" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segmenting-emails.png 1314w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segmenting-emails-300x144.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segmenting-emails-768x368.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/segmenting-emails-1024x491.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1314px) 100vw, 1314px" /></p>
<p>You’ll get more opens, revenue, and leads, while simultaneously increasing customer retention, acquisition, and transaction rates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, studies show that 60% of people will delete an email that they find irrelevant. 27% of people unsubscribe from irrelevant emails and 23% mark them as spam.</p>
<p>That’s right. Even if you’re not sending emails too frequently, your subscribers can still unsubscribe. But segmenting subscribers decreases the likelihood that your content will be perceived as irrelevant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Sales cycle</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Lifetime value</li>
<li>Interests</li>
<li>Browsing behavior</li>
<li>Previous purchases</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all common starting points for segmenting your email lists. Learning <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/email-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to deliver relevant content by segmenting your email subscribers</a> needs to be a priority.</p>
<h3>5. Delaying campaigns</h3>
<p>I regularly consult with lots of different website owners and businesses. When we talk about email marketing, lots of them have the wrong impression about when email campaigns should be sent.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. I’ll use nice and round numbers to make it easy.</p>
<p>Say you have 1,000 email subscribers currently on your list. You sent out a message to all of them last week. You’re ready to run a new campaign this week, but you only gained ten new subscribers since your last campaign.</p>
<p>That’s not an excuse to put off the campaign.</p>
<p>But all too often I see business owners delay campaigns until they get more subscribers. As long as you’re not sending the messages too frequently, you can still deploy a new campaign to the same people, regardless of how many subscribers you gained or lost in between messages.</p>
<p>Your current subscribers are already familiar with your brand. The <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/10/customer-retention-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">probability of selling</a> to a current customer is 60 to 70%. But the chances of selling to a new customer is just 5 to 20%.</p>
<p>Based on these numbers, there’s no reason for you to hold off. Plus, any new subscriber should be getting a welcome email, which we discussed earlier in this guide. So you’ll be able to target them with an offer right away. For everything else, pick a schedule and stick to it. Stop coming up with excuses for delaying new campaigns.</p>
<h3>6. Neglecting mobile users</h3>
<p>I’m assuming that most of you will be using a computer to craft your email marketing messages. On these devices, everything looks great.</p>
<p>Time to send it out to your subscribers, right? Not so fast.</p>
<p>You need to check and see how your message looks from mobile devices. Most email marketing software out there will have mobile-optimized features.</p>
<p>But the best way to do this is by sending a test email to yourself. I have a category on my email marketing list for office and executive. Basically, it’s just a few of my email addresses. I always send content to this group first, so I can check everything before it goes out to the masses.</p>
<p>Look at which <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devices people use the most</a> to check their emails.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43767" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/devices.png" alt="devices" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/devices.png 1078w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/devices-300x205.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/devices-768x526.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/devices-1024x701.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /></p>
<p>Smartphones are by far the most popular devices for people of all ages.</p>
<p>So even if your message is technically mobile-friendly based on the test run through your email software, there are other things you should keep in mind.</p>
<p>Avoid long blocks of text. Something that’s two or three lines on a desktop computer could up being ten lines on a 4-inch smartphone screen.</p>
<p>Your email should have visuals, but don’t rely too heavily on images. Here’s what I mean by this. Some email apps won’t automatically display images. So if your entire message is based on the context of your picture, you might be out of luck.</p>
<p>To fix this mistake, you’ve got to know <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-boost-sales-by-accomodating-the-needs-of-mobile-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to boost sales by accommodating the needs of mobile users</a>.</p>
<h3>7. Sending unprofessional messages</h3>
<p>Earlier I explained why you shouldn’t delay campaigns. But with that said, emails shouldn’t be sent in a matter of minutes either. Take the same approach that you would if you publishing a blog or adding anew landing page to your website.</p>
<p>Plan it out. Create an outline. Write the copy. Put it through some editing software. Proofread, and then proofread it again. Slang, spelling errors, and improper formatting will not reflect well on your business.</p>
<p>Imagine getting an email from a high-end brand trying to sell you a $2,500 watch. But the message is filled with type-os and grammar mistakes. Are you going to buy that watch?</p>
<p>Probably not. It looks like a poor reflection of that company as a whole.</p>
<p>People think that if you don’t take the time to do something as simple as writing an email, what other shortcuts are you taking?</p>
<p>The reply to address for the email should be your business. Not your old screen name @hotmail.com. You should also <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/email-ab-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A/B test all of your emails</a> for formatting purposes. All of this will ensure that your messages look as professional as possible.</p>
<h3>8. Not prioritizing sign-ups</h3>
<p>Your email marketing campaigns will only be as good as your subscriber list.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you have great content in your mobile-optimized message with the perfect CTA and professional design. If you only have 30 people to send it to, you can’t expect great results.</p>
<p>I realize that email lists don’t get built overnight, but this needs to be something that you’re always working at. No number is ever high enough.</p>
<p>If you just have “sign up for our emails” buried somewhere in the corner of your website, it won’t generate subscribers.</p>
<p>Remember, people are getting bombarded with nearly 1,000 emails per week. They won’t be signing up to receive more unless they have a good reason.</p>
<p>Check out his popup from the <a href="https://www.blenderseyewear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blenders Eyewear</a> homepage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43768" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blenders-eyewear.png" alt="blenders eyewear" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blenders-eyewear.png 1538w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blenders-eyewear-300x195.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blenders-eyewear-768x498.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blenders-eyewear-1024x664.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1538px) 100vw, 1538px" /></p>
<p>It’s a creative approach to collect emails.</p>
<p>First of all, you can’t miss it because it takes up nearly the whole screen while a user is browsing. Since they operate an ecommerce site, it’s safe to assume that the visitors are interested in their products.</p>
<p>By offering a discount in exchange for an email sign up, they’re essentially killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an incentive for purchases</li>
<li>Gain email subscribers</li>
</ol>
<p>Refer back to what we discussed earlier in terms of a welcome message. When a visitor signs up in a situation like this, it’s absolutely necessary that they are welcomed with the discount immediately.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have an ecommerce shop, you still need to prioritize sign-ups and add value to potential subscribers. Offer them free downloads, video tutorials, or other types of exclusive content for email opt-ins.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Email marketing is still alive and thriving. Everyone needs to make this a priority.</p>
<p>But some people are doing email marketing wrong. After reviewing this guide, you might have just realized that you fall into that category.</p>
<p>Don’t worry. These common mistakes are fairly easy to correct.</p>
<p>Identifying them is the hardest step. But now that you know what needs to be done, you can make those adjustments and apply the changes to your email marketing strategy moving forward.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SiteGround is one of the most popular web hosting services available on the market today. It’s a safe and reliable way to host your website in 2019.</p>
<p>More than 2 million active domains are hosted with <strong><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10191/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround</a></strong>.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why this service is so popular is because they offer hosting options and plans suitable for a wide range of websites and businesses. Small personal websites, business websites, and large ecommerce sites alike can all use SiteGround.</p>
<p>For those of you who are looking to find a hosting provider for your new website, SiteGround is definitely a top option for you to consider.</p>
<p><span id="more-43745"></span></p>
<p>It’s also a great choice for anyone who wants to switch hosting providers for their existing website since SiteGround has plans with a free site transfer. But we’ll talk about this in greater detail as we continue.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a better understanding of the plans, types of hosting, and top benefits offered by SiteGround. You can use this guide to make an informed decision to determine if SiteGround is the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best web hosting plan</a> for your needs.</p>
<h3>SiteGround Web Hosting Plans</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10191/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-43770 size-full" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Hosting-Plans.png" alt="Siteground Hosting Plans" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Hosting-Plans.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Hosting-Plans-300x89.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Hosting-Plans-768x228.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Hosting-Plans-1024x304.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></a></p>
<p>Like most web hosting services, SiteGround offers different plans for websites with varying needs. In this case, there are three tiers for most of their hosting types.</p>
<p>With the exception of cloud hosting and dedicated server hosting, the prices of these three plans will remain the same across the board for shared hosting, WordPress hosting, and Woocommerce hosting. We’ll dive deeper into those plans later in this guide.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll focus on the pricing and features of the three most popular plan options offered by SiteGround.</p>
<h4><strong>StartUp</strong></h4>
<p>As the name implies, the SiteGround StartUp plan is ideal for new websites. With rates starting at $3.95 per month, this plan is suitable for websites with less than 10,000 monthly visits.</p>
<p>You can only host one website with the StartUp plan, and it comes with 10 GB of web space. Other top features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free site builder</li>
<li>Free SSL and HTTPS</li>
<li>Free email accounts</li>
<li>Free CloudFlare CDN</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a basic plan, but definitely appropriate for new websites that are starting from scratch. For those of you who want more features and better performance, you’ll need to upgrade. You’ll also outgrow the StartUp plan as your traffic increases (which is a good thing).</p>
<h4><strong>GrowBig</strong></h4>
<p>The GrowBig plan starts at $5.95 per month. This is ideal for medium-sized websites averaging up to 25,000 monthly visits. GrowBig has 20 GB of web space and can host an unlimited number of sites.</p>
<p>Unlike the StartUp plan, GrowBig has enhanced caching ability. The SiteGround Supercacher has three levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 — Static content caching</li>
<li>Level 2 — Dynamic data caching</li>
<li>Level 3 — Database queries caching</li>
</ul>
<p>StartUp only caches at the first level, but GrowBig caches on all three levels.</p>
<p>If you sign up for the middle-tier plan offered by SiteGround, you’ll also get free on-demand backups, a free site transfer, as well as a staging feature for WordPress and Joomla sites. I’d say that the GrowBig plan will be suitable for most of you who are reading this guide.</p>
<h4><strong>GoGeek</strong></h4>
<p>GoGeek can accommodate up to 100,000 monthly visits and has 30 GB of web space. Obviously, this plan is made for bigger websites with high volumes of traffic.</p>
<p>Rates for GoGeek start at $11.95 per month, but the plan comes with all of the bells and whistles. In addition to everything that’s available in the GrowBig plan, GoGeek offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced priority support (expedited customer service to the most experienced agents)</li>
<li>PCI compliant servers (necessary for those of you who process payments online)</li>
<li>Git pre-installed (for creating repositories on your site)</li>
</ul>
<p>The name for this plan was inspired by technology geeks. So it’s made for those of you who want more control of your site. If you don’t understand some of the tech lingo that’s being mentioned in the GoGeek plan, it’s probably not for you. The only other reason why you’d need to upgrade to GoGeek is if you’re getting tons of monthly site traffic.</p>
<h3>WordPress hosting</h3>
<p>SiteGround offers hosting options specifically designed for WordPress users. This will save you time since you won’t need to manually download, install, and configure WordPress.</p>
<p>With SiteGround, you can take advantage of their automated process that’s as simple as clicking a button. This plan also makes it easier for you to customize your WordPress site by choosing a theme, picking your site functionalities, and installing marketing tools.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43771" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Wordpress-Hosting.png" alt="Siteground WordPress Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Wordpress-Hosting.png 1324w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Wordpress-Hosting-300x148.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Wordpress-Hosting-768x378.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Wordpress-Hosting-1024x504.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px" /></p>
<p>The WordPress Starter Kit from SiteGround is a great added feature for new WordPress sites. You don’t need any technical knowledge or experience to set this up.</p>
<p>If you have an existing WordPress site, SiteGround offers a free WordPress transfer. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteground-migrator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround Migrator plugin</a> takes care of everything for you. This is a secure way to transfer your site.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have a GrowBig or GoGeek plan, you can get your WordPress site migrated by one of the experts at SiteGround. This is a free service for one website before rates start at $30 per site.</p>
<h3>WooCommerce hosting</h3>
<p>SiteGround also has hosting options for ecommerce shops using WooCommerce.</p>
<p>The quick install and integration with WooCommerce is an easy way for you to create a professional theme for your online store. You can get the site up and running in minutes.</p>
<p>Just migrate your WooCommerce site using the migrator plugin. Just like WordPress hosting, WooCommerce migrations done by a SiteGround expert is free for one website if you’re on the GrowBig or GoGeek plan. Then you’ll have to pay $30 per each additional site.</p>
<p>If you have WooCommerce, you’re going to need to the GoGeek plan anyways, since that comes standard with PCI compliant servers.</p>
<h3>Cloud hosting</h3>
<p>Cloud hosting is a new way to host websites. The process uses multiple remote servers and is a great option for those of you who have websites that have outgrown the shared hosting plans.</p>
<p>With cloud hosting, SiteGround gives you guaranteed resources to meet your needs. Your own RAM and CPU won’t be shared with any other websites.</p>
<p>It’s also easy for you to scale your website with <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/everything-about-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this type of web hosting</a>.</p>
<p>You can upgrade your RAM, CPU, and disk space on-demand at any time. You don’t need to get approval to do this, and it happens without any website downtime.</p>
<p>Rather than always doing this manually, you can set up automatic scaling with SiteGround. It will adjust your CPU and RAM to meet the needs of unexpected traffic surges, but you still have control of all the parameters.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43772" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Managed-Cloud-Hosting.png" alt="Siteground Managed Cloud Hosting" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Managed-Cloud-Hosting.png 1999w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Managed-Cloud-Hosting-300x164.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Managed-Cloud-Hosting-768x419.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Managed-Cloud-Hosting-1024x559.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></p>
<p>There are four plans for SiteGround Cloud hosting. As you can see from the image above, the plans range from $80 to $240 per month. So there’s definitely plenty of options to choose from.</p>
<p>I’d say that the business plan will likely be a suitable choice for most of you who are using a cloud hosting service for the first time.</p>
<h3>Dedicated servers</h3>
<p>For those of you who don’t want to use cloud hosting or shared hosting, SiteGround offers dedicated server options as well.</p>
<p>This is perfect if you don’t want any restrictions in terms of the software you use on your website. You’ll also be able to make changes directly to your server if you go with this route.</p>
<p>All servers are managed by the experts at SiteGround. They also offer software designed to boost the performance of your server and provide added functionality.</p>
<p>You can also choose the location of your data center.</p>
<ul>
<li>United States</li>
<li>Europe</li>
<li>Asia-Pacific</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three dedicated server plans offered by SiteGround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry Server</li>
<li>Power Server</li>
<li>Super Power Server</li>
</ul>
<p>These plans start at $269 per month, $349 per month, and $729 per month, respectively.</p>
<h3>Benefits of SiteGround for web hosting</h3>
<p>There is plenty of upside to using SiteGround as a web hosting service. I just want to quickly highlight and explain why this platform stands out from its competitors.</p>
<h4><strong>High uptimes</strong></h4>
<p>When it comes to measuring how good a web host is, uptime is the ultimate metric. By definition, this is the amount of time that a server stays up and running.</p>
<p>A recent study shows that SiteGround has <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/average-hosting-uptime-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exceptionally high uptimes</a>, on average, over a twelve-month stretch.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43773" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Uptimes.png" alt="Siteground Uptimes" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Uptimes.png 1278w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Uptimes-300x184.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Uptimes-768x470.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Uptimes-1024x627.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1278px) 100vw, 1278px" /></p>
<p>In 2018, SiteGround ranked fourth compared to other web hosts judging by average uptime. As you can see, they were just barely beat out for the third place spot by a one-thousandth percentage point.</p>
<p>Overall, the average uptime for the 32 shared web hosting services in the study was 99.59%. SiteGround was significantly higher than the average and near the top of the list.</p>
<p>High uptimes ensure that your site will nearly always be up and running around the clock.</p>
<h4><strong>Fast load times</strong></h4>
<p>Just because your site is up, it doesn’t always mean that it will be fast. But take a look at the response time for this <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/zp1kq4gopbjs/3292798/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiteGround test website</a> that was set up by Hosting Facts.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43774" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Load-Times.png" alt="Siteground Load Times" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Load-Times.png 1902w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Load-Times-300x102.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Load-Times-768x262.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Siteground-Load-Times-1024x349.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1902px) 100vw, 1902px" /></p>
<p>We already talked about the great uptime, but now you can refer to the response time column.</p>
<p>The average response time for the first six months of 2019 was 662 ms. That’s phenomenal. In addition to using a good web host, you should also know the other <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/boost-website-loading-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top principles that boost website loading times</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Great customer support</strong></h4>
<p>Hopefully, you don’t have any issues with SiteGround. But in the event that you run into a problem, have a question, or need some assistance, it’s nice to know that they provide excellent customer support.</p>
<p>You can access phone support as well as live chat 24/7. As I mentioned earlier, you’ll have priority support if you have a GoGeek plan. This means that you’ll be connected with the most experienced SiteGround technicians whenever you need help.</p>
<h4><strong>Free features</strong></h4>
<p>Web hosting services will always try to hit you with add-ons at an upcharge. But SiteGround throws in some great features at no extra charge.</p>
<p>Your membership comes with one free site migration. This can be done with their migrator plugin, which we talked about earlier. If you have the GrowBig or GoGeek plan, a SiteGround professional will do the migration for you.</p>
<p>SiteGround plans also come with a free CDN and free SSL certificate.</p>
<p>Cloudflare CDN keeps images, videos, and other large files off of your server. As a result, your server is always fast. Since SiteGround users servers all over the globe, the CDN makes sure that files are stored closer to website visitors for fast delivery.</p>
<p>The SSL certificate is required for all websites. It protects private information being transmitted between devices and websites. SiteGround throwing this in for free is a nice touch since you’d need to get one regardless.</p>
<h4><strong>Flexible</strong></h4>
<p>Nearly any website can be hosted on SiteGround.</p>
<p>It’s a great web hosting service for beginners and experienced users alike. You don’t need to be too tech-savvy to understand how the platform works and get your site hosted. But on the other hand, if you like to be more hands-on with the server and take advantage of certain features, SiteGround has plans with you in mind.</p>
<p>There are also enough options on SiteGround to accommodate different web hosting needs, such as shared hosting, dedicated server hosting, and cloud hosting.</p>
<p>They have plans suitable for a wide range of average site traffic as well. So as your website scales, you can always upgrade to a plan that will meet your needs.</p>
<h4><strong>Money back guarantee</strong></h4>
<p>SiteGround offers a 30-day money back guarantee for their shared hosting plans. This shows that they stand behind the services that are offered.</p>
<p>Dedicated servers and cloud hosting plans have a 14-day money back guarantee, which is still enough time to tell if you’re happy with your service.</p>
<p>SiteGround will also refund you if they fail to meet a 99.9% uptime rate. This is clearly written in their <a href="https://www.siteground.com/term/121.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of service</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-43775" src="https://www.quicksprout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TOS.png" alt="TOS" srcset="https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TOS.png 1596w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TOS-300x100.png 300w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TOS-768x257.png 768w, https://quicksprout-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TOS-1024x343.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1596px) 100vw, 1596px" /></p>
<p>This relates back to what we talked about earlier, in terms of their high uptime rates. There’s a reason why it’s so high—SiteGround has a promise to stand behind.</p>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>There’s no such thing as a perfect web hosting service. While SiteGround is great, there are a few downsides that you should be made aware of before you proceed.</p>
<h4><strong>Setup fee</strong></h4>
<p>SiteGround charges a one-time setup fee for $14.95 with all of their plans. It’s not a deal breaker by any stretch, but it means you can’t just sign up for their lowest plan and be out the door for $3.95.</p>
<h4><strong>Renewal rates</strong></h4>
<p>At first glance, SiteGround’s pricing is very attractive. But those are only promotional rates.</p>
<p>When you renew, your rates will jump as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3.95 to $11.95 per month</li>
<li>$5.95 to $19.95 per month</li>
<li>$11.95 to $34.95 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost essentially triples across the board. So I’d recommend locking in the longest contract possible when you first sign up, which is 36 months. This will guarantee you a low rate for a while before you’re forced to renew.</p>
<h4><strong>Limited budget plan</strong></h4>
<p>For those of looking for the <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-cheap-web-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best cheap web hosting service</a>, SiteGround’s StartUp plan for $3.95 per month is definitely attention-grabbing.</p>
<p>It’s a great choice for those of you with smaller websites, but it’s fairly limited for anyone who plans on getting more than 10,000 visitors per month. You may have to upgrade faster than you anticipated if you start with their lowest priced web hosting plan.</p>
<h4><strong>No free domains</strong></h4>
<p>While SiteGround throws in a fair amount of free features, a free domain isn’t on the list.</p>
<p>That’s a bit surprising, considering that this tends to be the standard with other reputable web hosting services. At the very least, the cost of the domain is covered for the first year. But again, SiteGround doesn’t offer that.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ll get straight to the point—I would definitely recommend <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/go/qs10191/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SiteGround</strong></a> for web hosting.</p>
<p>This platform offers a wide range of hosting types and plans to accommodate the needs of nearly any website, large or small. SiteGround stacks up well compared to its competitors in terms of features and performance.</p>
<p>While the hosting service it’s perfect, it still gets the nod from us here at Quick Sprout. I’m confident that it will fulfill your web hosting needs.</p>
