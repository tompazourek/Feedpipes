<p>MediaMonkey 4.1.24 adds about 20 fixes and improvements, including syncronization improvements, tagging improvements, and a number of stability and performance enhancements.</p>



<p>&#8220;MediaMonkey 4 has been improved on a regular basis since it was launched over 5 years ago. Over the past couple of years we&#8217;ve been hard at work on the MediaMonkey 5 platform that will form the basis of versions to come over the next few years,&#8221; explained Jiri Hajek, VP Development. &#8220;It creates a foundation for a more modern UI, includes a framework that  allows MediaMonkey better integrate with cloud/music services, will allow  MediaMonkey to become cross-platform and support different form factors,  improves developer interfaces so that it can be customized to a greater  degree, lays the groundwork to make it a more social experience, and adds much improved functionality such as automated metadata lookup.&#8221;</p>



<p>MediaMonkey for Windows 4.1.24 is available at:<br> <a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/download">http://www.mediamonkey.com/download</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ventis Media is proud to announce a major new release of MediaMonkey. It makes MediaMonkey an even better management tool for serious collectors with a range of new functionality, including:</p>
<p>1) Wireless synchronization with <a title="MediaMonkey for Android" href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/android">MediaMonkey for Android</a>* and <a title="MediaMonkey for Windows 8 tablets" href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/touch">MediaMonkey for Windows 8 tablets</a>.  This allows users to sync their music collection wirelessly, while maintaining common metadata, ratings, play history, etc. across devices.</p>
<p>2) Bi-directional synchronization. Synchronization to Android devices is no longer a one-way street.  MediaMonkey can sync media and metadata in both directions so that music purchases and edits made on the phone also appear in the main library.</p>
<p>3) Improved device compatibility. MediaMonkey can now sync with almost all Android and iOS 7 (iPod / iPad) devices, with little to no configuration required.</p>
<p>4) Improved metadata lookup. MediaMonkey can now automatically look up Artwork and Lyrics.</p>
<p>5) Improved media sharing.  The MediaMonkey UPnP/DLNA server:</p>
<ul>
<li>now converts audio/video formats on the fly depending no the needs of individual UPnP/DLNA players</li>
<li>adds indexed browsing which makes it easier to browse huge lists of content</li>
<li>adds UPnP renderer &amp; controller functions enabling playback of content to other devices</li>
<li>can run as a service even when MediaMonkey isn&#8217;t running.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the new version improves Windows 8 compatibility, has a new coat of paint (new skin), and includes over 300 other fixes and improvements.<br />
MediaMonkey is the music and movie manager for serious collectors.  It works with your devices (Apple, Android, etc.), your files (MP3, AAC, FLAC, WMA, etc.), with you in full control of how your music is tagged, organized and shared.</p>
<p>A full changelog is available at:<br />
http://www.mediamonkey.com/information/changelog/</p>
<p>MediaMonkey 4.1.0 is available for download now at:<br />
http://www.mediamonkey.com/download</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* MediaMonkey for Android is currently in beta testing.  Until its release later this week, <a title="MediaMonkey Pro" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ventismedia.android.mediamonkeypro">MediaMonkey Pro</a> is available at a 70% discount on Google Play.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MediaMonkey has long been known as a music manager for serious collectors.  With today&#8217;s release, Ventis Media&#8217;s MediaMonkey 4.0 finally lives up to its moniker&#8211;managing video as well as music.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most commonly received requests we&#8217;ve had was to extend MediaMonkey&#8217;s music management, tagging, and organization tools to video.  MediaMonkey 4 will provide serious video collectors with the tools they need to effectively manage their collections,&#8221; indicated Russell Samuels, VP Marketing.</p>
<p>The new version tags AVI, MP4, and WMV with support for MKV coming in the future.  It can lookup album art and metadata, automatically rename and organize videos based on metadata, and convert between video formats. Additionally, it&#8217;s able to segment a library into &#8216;Collections&#8217; so that home videos, music videos, movies, and tv shows can be managed independently.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of the most significant MediaMonkey releases to-date.&#8221; said Jiri Hajek, VP Engineering.  &#8220;Although it adds a lot of new functionality, the new UI is even simpler than in previous versions of MediaMonkey. MediaMonkey 4 is accessible to the novice, but powerful enough for the most serious collector.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new version improves on the UI in so many ways: multiple collections are more easily managed, a tabbed interface allows to easily switch between different views/collections, the toolbar contains only the commands that are needed in any given context, and the overall look and feel is much improved.</p>
<p>Version 4 also improves devices synchronization for Android devices, adds library sharing over DLNA / UPnP, improved audio output via WASAPI, secure ripping for bit perfect CD rips, and portable mode to carry MediaMonkey on a USB stick.</p>
