								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/M1_SolutionsComposite.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1029" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366217" /></p>
<p>Remember those old photo printing kiosks you used to find in convenience stores and pharmacies? Kodak is trying to bring these back into vogue by releasing the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fimaging.kodakalaris.com%2Fretailers%2Fequipment%2Fm1-order-station" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">M1 Order Station</a>: a printing kiosk that seeks to &#8220;capitalize on consumers’ interest for photo products by offering high-quality prints from their smartphones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walk into a Walgreens or CVS in the United States, and you may be able to find the remnants of a photo printing kiosk somewhere in a dingy corner at the back of the store. If you&#8217;re lucky, it might even be working. But you&#8217;re just as likely to find something that&#8217;s broken, and you&#8217;re almost certainly going to find a machine that&#8217;s out of date.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Kodak Alaris wants to fix with the M1 Order Station. This &#8220;scalable&#8221; little photo printing kiosk is built to be used with smartphones instead of SD cards or thumb drives (although those still work), making it easy to grab a few prints, create a collage, or make a custom card during an impromptu trip to replenish your paper towels or pick up some NyQuil.</p>
<p><div class="fluid-iframe" style="max-width: 800px;"><div class="fluid-iframe__inner" style="padding-top:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x0wqtmDjouY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>
<p>Admittedly, announcing the release of a new photo printing kiosk in 2019 seems&#8230; quaint. Almost like releasing a new VHS player with smartphone connectivity. Then again, holding a print—even a snapshot of friends or family—is an incredibly satisfying experience and the reason why instant film cameras are doing so well.</p>
<p>If something like the M1 Order Station makes its way into pharmacies across the US, will people actually use them? Will you suddenly start seeing 4&#215;6 prints all over the place again? Or will the few of these that are actually ordered and installed simply collect dust until they become smartphone-connected versions of their defunct predecessors? I guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait and find out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about the M1, head over to <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fimaging.kodakalaris.com%2Fretailers%2Fequipment%2Fm1-order-station" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">the Kodak Moments website</a>.

<p>It&#8217;s not often someone &#8220;reimagines&#8221; an established bit of kit, but that&#8217;s what the folks over at <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.photorockbar.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Photo Rock Bar</a> have done. This strange looking weight for tripods, light stands and boom arms is meant to replace ye old sand bag with something more convenient and versatile. </p>
<p>The Photo Rock Bar came to our attention earlier this week when we were contacted by one of the contraption&#8217;s creators. As you can see from the images below, the Photo Rock Bar consists of a tubular nylon case that attaches directly onto your tripod or C-Stand using two removable straps. Inside the zip-up tube are 7 lbs worth of removable weights made from recycled steel.</p>
<p>When strapped down correctly, the creators of Photo Rock Bar promise that it will &#8220;not move or sway and cause movement or vibration problems like hanging weight bags can.&#8221; And if you really need some stability, it&#8217;s compact enough that you could even attach multiple Rock Bars to a single tripod or stand.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look:</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/1-2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="746" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366193" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/4-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="383" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366196" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/3-2.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="744" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366195" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/5-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="303" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366197" /></p>

<p>Even if we don&#8217;t think the Rock Bar will completely replace sandbags for photographers, it&#8217;s an interesting alternative that could legitimately be more useful in many situations. To learn more about this product, head over to the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.photorockbar.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Photo Rock Bar website</a> where you can purchase one for yourself for $45. </p>

<p>Photographer <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joeyl.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Joey L.</a> is known for pushing himself to capture stunning imagery. From his documentary work on the frontlines of <a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/09/13/born-urgency-joey-l-releases-book-film-war-isis/" data-wpel-link="internal">the fight against ISIS</a>, to <a href="https://petapixel.com/2013/03/03/interview-with-photographer-joey-l/" data-wpel-link="internal">A-list celebrity and commercial work</a>, he never shies away from a physical or creative challenge. His most recent commercial shoot was both.</p>
<p>The ad campaign featured the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zaafcollection.com%2F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">ZAAF Collection</a>, a premium lifestyle brand created by Joey&#8217;s friend and personal hero Abai Schulze, and whose bags are made entirely in Africa. For this special campaign, Schulze wanted to highlight the heritage of her homeland and place her brand in several of &#8220;the unique locations that people don&#8217;t really know about&#8221; in Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many stereotypes about my homeland,&#8221; says Schulze in the short doc above. &#8220;With a shoot like this, you can break that narrative.&#8221; And so the duo chose to capture this campaign in the Danakil Desert, one of the most remote regions in Ethiopia and hottest places on Earth.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/ZAAF-Joey-L-Afar-Ethiopia-Shoot-002.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1536" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366158" /></p>
<p>This is not your standard on-location shoot. &#8220;Our crew climbed an active volcano, camped for days without electricity, and yet we somehow managed to photograph an advertising campaign in one of the hottest places on Earth,&#8221; explains Joey <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joeyl.com%2Fblog%2Fall%2Fpost%2Fzaaf-ethiopia" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">on his blog</a>. </p>
<p>The shoot included several days on the rim of the active volcano Erta Ale (which last erupted in 2017), a day in the Dallol Sulphur Springs where the rotten air smell was sometimes overwhelming and the temperature reached an unbelievable 46°C (114°F), and some gorgeous imagery captured on the Afar Salt Plains.</p>
<p>The resulting images have that high-fashion sheen that you expect from commercial work. And yet they were all captured in grueling conditions, sometimes after hours of hiking and days without showers or electricity. Keep that in mind as you scroll through some of the images below, which Joey kindly allowed us to share:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why Joey says the ZAAF Collection photo shoot, &#8220;will go down as one of my top 5 favorite photoshoots of all time- a special project for both the overall vision as well as the journey creating it.&#8221; To experience the whole process of creating these images, watch the behind-the-scenes documentary above and then <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joeyl.com%2Fblog%2Fall%2Fpost%2Fzaaf-ethiopia" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">head over to Joey&#8217;s blog</a> to see all of the images he captured. </p>

After the company&#8217;s <a href="https://petapixel.com/2018/08/21/how-meyer-optik-gorlitz-won-at-kickstarter-but-failed-at-life/" data-wpel-link="internal">very public failure</a>—including the <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/03/07/meyer-optik-gorlitz-admits-nocturnus-was-a-modified-chinese-lens/" data-wpel-link="internal">embarrassing admission</a> that the $3,000 &#8220;Nocturnus&#8221; was just a modified $850 Chinese lens—the brand and <a href="https://petapixel.com/2018/12/13/meyer-optik-gorlitz-is-back-from-the-dead-with-a-new-owner/" data-wpel-link="internal">its new owner</a>, OPC Optics, is preparing to re-release &#8220;optimized&#8221; and &#8220;redesigned&#8221; versions of several lenses this year.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meyer-optik-goerlitz.com%2Fen%2Fblog%2Fdetail%2FsCategory%2F39%2FblogArticle%2F6" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">announcement</a> published on the brand&#8217;s website earlier this week, OPC Optics revealed that the &#8220;renewal of the Meyer Optik Görlitz portfolio [is] on schedule.&#8221; This renewal will include several optimized and redesigned lenses, as well as a brand new creation. </p>
<figure id="attachment_366130" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-366130" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-01-at-1.34.47-PM.png" alt="" width="1494" height="806" class="size-full wp-image-366130" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-366130" class="wp-caption-text">The Trioplan 100 will be the first lens to be re-released by the re-born Meyer Optik Görlitz</figcaption></figure>
<p>First up will be a &#8220;revised&#8221; version of the Trioplan 100, dubbed the Trioplan 100 f/2.8 II. The lens is currently in the prototype phase and will be the first Meyer Optik lens to be re-released later this summer.</p>
<p>After this, Meyer Optik intends to release redesigns of five lenses, including: the Trioplan 50, Lydith 30, Primoplan 75, Primoplan 58, and Trioplan 35+ (in that order). These lenses will feature a &#8220;complete redesign of the mechanics and outer geometry&#8221; in order to ensure the best possible &#8220;haptic&#8221; and imaging performance, with the Trioplan 50 already almost ready to start real-world testing.</p>
<p>Finally, Meyer Optik also intends to release a brand new lens. The Primagon 50mm f/2.0—the first Meyer Optik Görlitz lens created entirely under the OPC Optics umbrella—is still being kept mostly under-wraps, but we know that it will feature 8 elements in 6 groups and will &#8220;probably be launched this year.&#8221; </p>
<figure id="attachment_366128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-366128" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/trioplan-50-i.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="size-full wp-image-366128" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-366128" class="wp-caption-text">The Trioplan 50 is one of the lenses receiving a &#8220;complete redesign&#8221; by OPC Optics, promising better image quality and &#8220;haptics&#8221; when it&#8217;s re-released.</figcaption></figure>
<p>No pricing or official [re]release date have been announced for any of these lenses, but Meyer Optik and OPC Optics promise that they are &#8220;working hard to optimize production and internal processes so that the new lenses can be offered at realistic and attractive prices without compromising quality and precision.&#8221; </p>
<p>No doubt, Meyer Optik Görlitz/OPC Optics has a long way to go to regain the industry&#8217;s trust. Thousands of backers <a href="https://petapixel.com/2018/10/17/if-you-backed-a-meyer-optik-gorlitz-on-kickstarter-your-money-is-gone/" data-wpel-link="internal">were left high-and-dry</a> when the company went under, and it&#8217;ll take more than press release promises of &#8220;optimized&#8221; and &#8220;redesigned&#8221; lenses to prove that future Meyer Optik Görlitz lenses will be worth the investment. But fans of the venerable brand are sure watching these progress reports closely and hoping for the best. </p>

<p>Back in the Sony SLT days, the company included an incredibly useful feature into the a99 Mark II called the Custom Focus Limiter. It allowed you to limit your autofocus to any distance range you wanted, and by golly, we wish it were still a thing.</p>
<p>In the video above, Chris Niccolls and Jordan Drake of <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpreview.com%2Fvideos%2F6142638580%2Fdpreview-tv-bring-back-the-custom-focus-limiter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">DPReviewTV</a> explain why they love this feature, and implore camera makers to add it back into their modern bodies. </p>
<p>As they point out, focus limiters do exist on high-end lenses, but they only lock the lens into a pre-specified focus range (e.g. 3m &#8211; infinity). A custom, software-based focus limiter like the one Sony used to use in the a99 II has no such limitation. You could potentially set your autofocus to a much more restricted focus range, ensuring that your camera never accidentally focuses on the far background when, say, you&#8217;re shooting sports or outdoor portraits.</p>
<p>Check out the full video above to see Niccolls and Drake demonstrate this useful feature in action. Then drop into the comments and let us know what other now-defunct features you&#8217;d like to see in the next generation of cameras.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/feature.jpg" alt="" width="1231" height="821" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366091" /></p>
<p>Why do photographers need to market themselves? In a phrase: so that you don&#8217;t starve to death. No, but seriously. Otherwise, you risk ending up like Vincent van Gogh who (in the words of Steven Pressfield) “produced masterpiece after masterpiece and never found a buyer in his whole life.”</p>
<p>A lot of artists have this notion that they’re the creative person, and marketing belongs to the business world. Some even think it’s evil or dirty to promote themselves, and they don’t want to have anything to do with the grimy world of self-promotion.</p>
<p>But the truth is, it’s your job to market yourself. You are the artist, and you know best how to spread the word about your work. After all, you created it. You can’t rest after creating your art; you need to start marketing it. </p>
<p>To that end, here are 8 invaluable lessons from the masters of marketing that every photographer should consider implementing.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1231" height="821" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366083" /></p>
<h2>Lesson #1: Provide Value and Create Trust</h2>
<p>Providing value means continuously putting work out into the world—blogging consistently, making videos, taking part in interactions on social media, etc.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk talks a lot about providing massive value without asking anything in return, and he’s a big proponent of having a social media presence. In his latest book <em>Crushing It</em>, you can read a story about a dentist who massively grew her business by building a presence on Snapchat. All the kids in the area wanted to go to her.</p>
<p>Jared Polin of FroKnowsPhoto is another great example of a photographer who provides massive amounts of value through his YouTube channel. His efforts have paid off. According to Jared, he can nowadays generate seven figures a year.</p>
<p>Putting out content <em>is</em> marketing. It creates trust as people get to know you, and that&#8217;s the point. If people don’t know who you are, they don’t trust you; if they don’t trust you, they don’t want to spend their money on you.</p>
<p>One common hurdle is that many artists, photographers included, are worried about people stealing their work. They watermark their images and spend a lot of energy trying to protect their work. They are afraid of giving out their secrets and ideas. But as Tim O’Reilly puts it: “The problem for most artists isn’t piracy, it’s obscurity.” </p>
<p>Ask yourself: is my problem that people are stealing my work, or that nobody knows about it in the first place?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an unfortunate reality, but free spreads quicker than something that costs money. If Facebook had charged you money every month when it started, it wouldn’t be so popular as it is now. Sometimes, that&#8217;s what it takes to provide value and create trust.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1190" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366084" /></p>
<h2>Lesson #2: Be Authentic</h2>
<p>Isaac Asimov once said of Carl Sagan, whose work he admired greatly: “You are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style, and when I read what you write, I hear you talking.”</p>
<p>This from Asimov, who was the one who wrote and published hundreds of books and short stories over the course of his life!</p>
<p>I believe that people don’t follow blogs, they follow people. What do I mean by that? I think it’s not so much the content, but the unique voice that people are drawn to. Content is important, but the &#8220;how&#8221; is more important than the “what.&#8221; In other words: every story has probably already been told, but has it been told by you?</p>
<p>There’s an entertaining channel on YouTube called “Camera Conspiracies.” I haven’t been able to keep up with his videos lately, but when I did, I noticed that many people followed him even though they weren’t into film-making, vlogging or the video aspect of cameras in general (which is what he mostly talks about). They follow him because he’s unique. He doesn’t have filters. He’s just him. </p>
<p>Whether people like him or not is probably none of his concern. He puts himself out there, saying “this is me, like it or not.” </p>
<p>The same goes for most successful creators online. We all crave authenticity. In a world where everyone is trying to be someone they’re not, putting up a mask, filtering their words, and trying not to offend others, the ability to be authentic is a key asset.</p>
<p>If you hold yourself back, trying to be liked by everyone else, you end up boring. Be hated or loved, but don&#8217;t be boring. Boring is “meh.” Boring equals the death of your creative career.</p>

<h2>Lesson #3: The Power of Word of Mouth</h2>
<p>Forget about SEO and all the fancy optimization methods, word of mouth is probably the most powerful form of marketing an artist or a business can double down on. </p>
<p>Word of mouth is not sharing through social media. People don’t generally trust much of what&#8217;s shared through social media, even if it comes from a friend. Word of mouth is real life sharing. According to a study by McKinsey, word of mouth is the primary factor behind <em>20 to 50</em> percent of all purchasing decisions.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“[Companies] live or die by word of mouth.”<br />&#8211; Jonah Berger
</p></blockquote>
<p>Marketing masterminds Seth Godin and Ryan Holiday agree. In his book <em>This is Marketing</em>, Godin has written that he&#8217;d rather have people find his blog using the keyword “Seth” than the keyword “blog.”</p>
<p>So how do you create word of mouth? Well, that’s another story, and it can be incredibly difficult. Just remember: word of mouth always starts with a single customer. As Seth Godin has wrote in his book <em>Tribes</em>: “Sell one.”</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg" alt="" width="1167" height="778" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366086" /></p>
<h2>Lesson #4: Use Your Real Name</h2>
<p>One of the best ideas I got from Eric Kim (besides owning your platform) is to use your real name. If you’re an artist, using your real name might seem trivial at first, but there are at least two convincing reasons for it.</p>
<p>First, using your real name makes it easier to be authentic, which would be a bit harder to do when you’re operating under some abstract name such as “Picture Perfect Photos” or some-such (I just made that name up on the spot, any connection to real brands or companies is coincidental).</p>
<p>Second, using your real name helps to spread the word because people tend to remember real names better than abstract names, because we know there’s an actual person behind the work.</p>
<p>When I started out, I was always trying to be this anonymous person because it allowed me to hide behind a pseudonym in case I might need it. Using your real name doesn’t give you that possibility. You put yourself and your reputation on the line. You take full responsibility for every word you say, sentence you write, and action you take.</p>
<p>It might be scary at first, but the fact remains: real names generate more trust and, because they stick easier, they also help to facilitate that word of mouth mentioned above.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/5.jpg" alt="" width="1231" height="821" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366087" /></p>
<h2>Lesson #5: Find Your People (Following)</h2>
<p>Business geniuses Eric Ries and Peter Thiel talk about the false hope that if you “build it, they will come” in their books <em>The Lean Startup</em> and <em>Zero to One</em>, respectively. Just because you make something that you care about, doesn’t mean other people wil care.</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Customers will not come just because you build it. You have to make that happen, and it’s harder than it looks.”<br />&#8211; Peter Thiel, <em>Zero to One</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, photographer and filmmaker Ted Forbes made a video called “Nobody Cares About Your Photography” where he discussed why it&#8217;s important to do work that matters, even if nobody cares. I agree and would go even further. </p>
<p>While it’s true that most people don’t care about your work, if you do work that matters, there will be people out there who will. You just need to find them. Seth Godin calls it, “finding the smallest viable audience.”</p>
<p>Novelist Stefan Zweig understood this 80 years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;I had acquired what, to my mind, is the most valuable kind of success a writer can have—a faithful following, a reliable group of readers who looked forward to every new book and bought it, who trusted me, and whose trust I must not disappoint.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Stefan Zweig, <em>The World of Yesterday: Memoirs of a European</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>To be clear, social media “following” is not a following. These are just people who often don’t even see your stuff. They’re fine with that, and you should be too. You can’t expect someone who follows hundreds or thousands of other people to see your work, let alone buy from you.</p>
<p><em>True</em> followers are people who actually seek out your work. They visit your website religiously; read your newsletters; watch your videos without any bell notifications and wonder what has happened to you if you haven’t posted anything for a few days.</p>
<p>These people are your bread and butter. There might not be many of them, but they are your true fans and you should do everything you can to foster this kind of following.</p>
<p>As Seth Godin puts it in his book <em>This is Marketing</em>: “The goal isn’t to maximize your social media numbers. The goal is to be known to the smallest viable audience.”</p>
<p>Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of <em>WIRED</em>, found out that a thousand true fans might be sufficient to live a better-than-decent life. So, instead of dreaming of hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, it might just be more profitable to have a few thousand true fans instead.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/6-1.jpg" alt="" width="1191" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366088" /></p>
<h2>Lesson #6: Price <em>is</em> Marketing</h2>
<p>Every once in a while, an article or story is published about a photographer who complains that clients are low-balling them or that photographers don’t get paid fairly.</p>
<p>This is a marketing problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Marketing changes your pricing. Pricing changes your marketing.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Seth Godin, This is Marketing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the price you ask depends on what you offer (and the other way around). What is the story you tell?</p>
<p>If you offer high-quality luxury service, then your prices should reflect that. It’s not just the physical or digital pictures you take or your years of experience that make the price high. It’s everything: your emotional labour, your respect, your caring about the customer, all the way to the packaging and paper you use. Essentially, you are offering more than a service—you provide an experience.</p>
<p>It’s okay to charge a lot of money if you’re able to provide a “change” in your client. We’re all on a journey of transformation. We seek transformation. If you can give that to someone, you’re golden.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Low price is the last refuge of a marketer who has run out of generous ideas.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Seth Godin, This is Marketing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Godin, lowering the price has further implications, making it <em>harder</em> for people to trust you. This is because people rationalize spending a lot of money by making up a story about the value they will receive, and a low price takes that story away.</p>
<p>Obviously, before you can charge a lot of money, you need trust. The more money you ask for, the more trust you need. Would you buy $500 sneakers from an unknown brand that you&#8217;ve never heard about? Would you buy a (cheaper) generic brand of Coke for a house party? Most people won&#8217;t, because they don’t trust these brands.</p>
<p>Over the years, photographer Eric Kim has given away a lot of value in terms of literally thousands of blog posts, videos and dozens of e-books. As a result, he&#8217;s built enough trust and a loyal enough following that he can charge a lot of money for his workshops. He&#8217;s offering more than a product, he can offer an experience.</p>
<p>According to the definition of a <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fv%2Fveblen-good.asp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Veblen good</a>, the more something costs, the more people want it. Of course, not everyone can afford what they want, but that’s not even necessary. As Kim has pointed out, he only needs a handful of students a year to make a decent living.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/7-1.jpg" alt="" width="1231" height="821" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366089" /></p>
<h2>Lesson #7: Own Your Platform</h2>
<p>Many photographers and artists don’t have their own website. Instead, they rely solely on Instagram or some other social media platform. But Kim has long promoted the idea of owning your own platform and why it’s important.</p>
<p>Being dependent on someone else’s platform poses many problems. I&#8217;ll use Instagram as an example here, but it applies to any social media platform.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, imagine that Instagram disappears one day. If you have spent years building your following on that platform, then you would have to start all over again on a new platform, without any way to contact or inform your following on IG.</p>
<p>True, Instagram probably won’t disappear suddenly, but it happened to Myspace. Everything is in constant change; social media platforms come and go. Something else could become more popular than Instagram at any moment. Flickr is an excellent example of something that was once very popular falling into near-obscurity.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, you are a guest. You don’t own the space; you rent it. Which also means you pay rent by watching ads and providing data about yourself so that Facebook can sell it to advertisers.</p>
<p>You can also be thrown out, and you won’t even get a month’s notice. You have to be politically correct and behave nicely, lest you upset your landlord. You can’t express yourself freely. Instagram has the final say so, what is allowed and what is not.</p>
<p>On your own platform, you can do whatever you want. It’s your little corner on the Internet. You own it, you control it, and you choose how you curate it. It offers freedom and, believe me, freedom is worth paying for.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong, your customization on someone else's platform is very limited. You can’t choose how you present your work. Once a photo is uploaded, you can’t simply delete it, change it, and re-upload it the way you can do it on your website.

<strong>Fourth</strong>, Instagram controls your photos and your followers. It can delete photos if it wants and ask you for money so you can actually reach all of your followers. There’s nothing you can do except to protest; which is basically the equivalent effect of yelling at a wall. Even when protests <a href="https://petapixel.com/2016/03/16/instagram-feed-change/" data-wpel-link="internal">reach a fever pitch</a>, companies rarely listen.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, your followers are not really your followers. They’re Instagram’s followers. There’s no real way to interact with them directly. You can post a story or a picture, but only a fraction will see it, so you often have to beg for people to enable notifications.</p>
<p>None of this means you should avoid social media entirely. I believe social media is a very powerful marketing tool if used correctly, but it&#8217;s a poor choice for your platform. Spend some energy on your own platform, where nobody else gets to call the shots.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/8.jpg" alt="" width="1224" height="816" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366090" /></p>
<h2>Lesson #8: Set Up an Email Newsletter ASAP</h2>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;As is true for so many things, the best time to have built your network was yesterday. The second best time is right now.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Ryan Holiday, <em>The Perennial Seller</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in the age of social media, one of the most powerful marketing tools available today is the email list. There’s a reason everyone uses it. It has stood the test of time, and it works.</p>
<p>Your email list is the follower list you should be building. You will own this list. It enables you to communicate with your followers directly, and you can take this list with you—it’s platform-independent.</p>
<p>Even if your website is taken down for some reason, you can still communicate with your people. You can keep them updated, share your thoughts, and tell them about your new products, exhibitions, and events. It serves you for a lifetime. No expiration date.</p>
<p>Most people don’t change their email addresses very often, and there’s a much bigger chance of them seeing your email (and therefore being reminded of your existence) even if they don&#8217;t ultimately read it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;If you want people to consume your work and to know what you do next, you have to make it possible for them to hear about it as easily and regularly as possible.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Ryan Holiday, <em>The Perennial Seller</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Before he published his first book, Ryan Holiday started an email newsletter where he gave monthly book recommendations. By the time he was about to publish his book, the list had grown significantly.</p>
<p>Do you think there were people who bought his new book because he told them about it in his email newsletter? You bet. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As Ryan Holiday put it: “The idea that you won’t have to work to sell your product is more than entitled.” It presupposes that everyone will flock to your work and that they care. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the salesperson.&#8221;<br /> &#8211; Peter Thiel, Zero to One
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ryan Holiday describes how the road to creative success feels like in his book <em>The Perennial Seller</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Art is the kind of marathon where you cross the finish line and instead of getting a medal placed around your neck, the volunteers roughly grab you by the shoulders and walk you over the starting line of another marathon.</p></blockquote>
<p>By that “another marathon,” he means marketing his work. This means promoting your work is equally important as <em>doing</em> your work. Books, just like everything else, don’t sell themselves.</p>
<p>There are too many great artists out there, many of them waiting to be discovered. It’s a notion of romanticism-sitting around waiting for magic to happen.</p>
<p>The problem with this waiting is obvious: you’re waiting. Instead of taking charge and being the engine of your own life and success, you’re at the mercy of sheer luck. Sure, you might be discovered, but what if you aren’t? Much more often than not, if you don’t <em>make</em> things move forward, nothing happens. This is real-life.</p>
<p>Because there are so many exceptionally good artists out there, skills alone won’t make you stand out. Excellent skills are assumed—baseline. You need to be more than that. </p>
<p>Ultimately, marketing your work means valuing your work. You are essentially saying: “I&#8217;m confident that my work is great, and I have no shame telling you about it.”</p>

<p>For now, details about this rumored camera are pretty few and far between, but it sounds like Canon may be jumping back in to the spec wars head first. A move that might give disgruntled Canon users a reason to hold on a bit longer before switching to the competition.</p>

<p>After teasing releasing teasers for the YN200 pocket flash and YN560-TX radio transmitter <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/07/04/yongnuo-yn200-pocket-flash-will-be-a-godox-clone/" data-wpel-link="internal">last month</a>, Yongnuo <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hkyongnuo.com%2Fe-detaily.php%3FID%3D475" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">officially revealed</a> the Godox AD200 clone and the TTL and HSS compatible transmitter this week, hoping to reclaim a bit of the budget gear market that Godox has all but taken over.</p>
<p>The Godox AD200 (AKA the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fl%2F%3Fsearchinfo%3Dflashpoint%2Bevolv%2B200%26kbid%3D67085" rel="norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Flashpoint eVOLV 200</a>) made quite the splash <a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/02/27/godoxs-ad200-packs-200ws-power-flash-size-candy-bar/" data-wpel-link="internal">when it was first announced</a> back in 2017. More powerful than a speedlight but just as compact, the AD200 packed 200W/s of power into a pocket-sized monolight.</p>
<p>The Yongnuo YN200 does the exact same thing&#8230; for about $80 less.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/1.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366036" /></p>
<p>The Yongnuo YN200 was <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hkyongnuo.com%2Fe-detaily.php%3FID%3D475" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">officially announced</a> this week, and as expected, it boasts a 200W/s of power from a bare-bulb design, a removable Li-Ion battery for power, and support for TTL and HSS. It also features the 560 PRO radio system, so it will automatically sense whether you&#8217;re shooting on Canon, Nikon or Sony and is backwards compatible with any Yongnuo 2.4GHz flash gear.</p>
<p>Other now-confirmed specs include a 2-second recycle time when shooting at full power, approximately 500 full-power flashes per charge, support for 6 groups and 16 channels, a built-in Micro USB port for firmware updates, and the ability to adjust the flash from 1/1 to 1/64 power in 1/3 increments using the built-in LCD on the back of the flash:</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/3.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="560" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366038" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366045" /></p>
<p>Finally, the YN200 will also offer attachments in case you&#8217;re not keep on using the bare bulb. The compact bayonet modifier mount will let you attach diffusers and other heads, although, as <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fflashhavoc.com%2Fyongnuo-yn200-speedlite-released%2F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer"><em>FlashHavoc</em> points out</a>, &#8220;there is no clamping thumbscrew to lock reflectors and modifiers in place,&#8221; nor any support for an LED modeling light.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t entirely surprising though—Yongnuo were going to have to cut corners somewhere to drop the price. Speaking of which, the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hkyongnuo.com%2Fe-detaily.php%3FID%3D475" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Yongnuo YN200</a> will be available this month, and should cost about $250 based on early online listings. </p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/2.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="860" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366040" /></p>
<p>In addition to the YN200, Yongnuo <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hkyongnuo.com%2Fe-detaily.php%3FID%3D476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">also announced</a> the anticipated YN560-TX PRO radio transmitter with full support for HSS and TTL, and the next-gen 560 PRO Radio System found in Yongnuo&#8217;s newer flashes (like the YN200).</p>
<p>As expected, the YN560-TX features the exact same enclosure/body as the YN-E3-RT Transmitter, an AF Assist Light, a quick lever locking foot, and support for up to 5 groups and 16 channels. You also get backlit buttons and a built-in Micro USB port for firmware updates, and the transmitter is powered by two AA batteries.</p>
<p>There is no sync port or shutter release port.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/6.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366042" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/08/7.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366041" /></p>
<p>The Canon version of the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hkyongnuo.com%2Fe-detaily.php%3FID%3D476" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">YN560-TX PRO</a> will be available this month, and is has already been spotted online for around $65. Nikon and Sony versions are expected later.</p>
<p>Given the popularity of Godox&#8217;s AD200 and the <a href="https://petapixel.com/2017/03/30/ultra-portable-godox-ad200-can-overpower-texas-sun/" data-wpel-link="internal">impressive photo shoots</a> that several photographers have managed to achieve using the tiny monolight (or <a href="https://petapixel.com/2018/10/16/this-cluster-light-is-made-of-7-godox-ad200-flashes/" data-wpel-link="internal">a bunch of them strapped together</a>), we expect the Yongnuo YN200 will sell quite well. The only question is: given the more limited support and ultra-budget branding, would you rather spend the extra $80 and buy the Godox/Flashpoint version? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>JPEGmini has announced a new plug-in that brings its widely used JPEG file size shrinking technology to Capture One Pro 12.</p>
<p>Phase One released Capture One Pro 12 back in November 2018, opening the door to third-party plug-ins for the first time, and JPEGmini was selected as one of the first software companies to create a plugin for the photo editing software.</p>
<p>Photographers exporting photos from Capture One can now choose to have JPEGmini automatically optimize the JPEGs for the smallest possible file size while retaining the same image quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;The resulting benefits will be faster uploading times, better UX and faster loading websites, thus improving Google search rank and customer satisfaction,&#8221; JPEGmini says.</p>
<p><a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpreview.com%2Fnews%2F5786692003%2Fjpegmini-brings-its-image-compression-plug-in-to-capture-one-12" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer"><em>DPReview</em> tested</a> the new plug-in using full-size JPEGs captured with a <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fcar.html%3Fkbid%3D67085" rel="norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Canon EOS R</a> and achieved a nearly 75% reduction in file size when exporting from Capture One 12 &#8212; 30MB files were shrunk down to 7-8MB without any change in dimensions or loss in apparent image quality.</p>
<p>The new JPEGmini Capture One plugin is bundled within <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpegmini.com%2Fcreators%23choose-package" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">the $89 JPEGmini Pro Suite</a>, which also includes the standalone app (priced at $59 by itself), the Lightroom plug-in, and the Photoshop extension. You can also test out the software before you buy by <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpegmini.com%2Fcreators" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">downloading a free trial</a>.</p>

<p>The quality of a camera&#8217;s shutter sound probably isn&#8217;t high on the list of what any photographer considers when looking to buy a new body, but Lensrentals has just published <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lensrentals.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F07%2Fthe-shutter-sounds-of-our-most-popular-cameras%2F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">a tongue-in-cheek review/comparison</a> of shutter sounds anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a leading authority on optical testing and product reviews, it occurred to the Lensrentals staff recently that we owed it to The Internet to explore the final frontier of camera comparisons, a comprehensive examination of shutter sounds,&#8221; the camera gear rental company says. &#8220;Our thorough and scientific testing covered multiple models from nearly every major camera manufacturer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 5.5-minute video above presents the shutter sounds of each camera for your listening pleasure.</p>
<p>And after &#8220;weeks of debate and analysis,&#8221; Lensrentals concluded that the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Finkd850.html%3Fkbid%3D67085" rel="norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Nikon D850</a> (heard at 1:01), Olympus PEN E-PL7 (4:34), and <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fipx645z.html%3Fkbid%3D67085" rel="norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Pentax 645Z</a> (3:50) have the best shutter sounds on the market.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/threewinners-800x250.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="250" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365857" /></p>
<p>The Nikon D850 sound &#8220;is an absolute classic,&#8221; Lensrentals writes. &#8220;The shutter on the D850 is the default &#8216;professional&#8217; camera sound in our collective mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>And regarding the medium format $5,000 Pentax 645Z, Lensrentals says: &#8220;No one within fifty feet of the Pentax 645Z will have any doubts as to who has territorial dominance in the area. Prove to your friends and neighbors that you’re recording more pixels than they are and, therefore, are the better photographer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The worst sounding shutters, in Lensrentals&#8217; opinion, was the <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Flcsl.html%3Fkbid%3D67085" rel="norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Leica SL 601</a> (heard at 4:55), <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa772.html%3Fkbid%3D67085" rel="norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Sony Alpha a77 II</a> (3:34), and <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpcs1r.html%3Fkbid%3D67085" rel="norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Panasonic Lumix DC-S1R</a> (1:57).</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Leica is a German company, but, for this amount of money, the camera should speak French,&#8221; Lensrentals says. &#8220;We expected more rounded corners and less hard edges. The shutter needs to drop some vowels.&#8221;</p>
<p>And although the Panasonic S1R has been earning rave reviews for other aspects of its photographic abilities, Lensrentals was disappointed that its shutter &#8220;sounds like a mousetrap.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re a photographer who cares way too much about how nice your shutter sounds, hopefully this review can point you in the right direction as you search for a new <del datetime="2019-07-31T16:43:50+00:00">shutter sound</del> camera to fall in love with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/advancefeescamfeattt-800x420.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="420" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365840" /></p>
<p>There is a persistent scam going around that is so pervasive that you might think everyone has heard about it and is immune to it. Yet, I often enough see this come up as a question in a Facebook group when a photographer is unsure if an inquiry is a scam. Most often they are. This is how these advance-fee scams work and how photographers are scammed.</p>
<p>The scammer will overpay you and you have to pay the difference to another vendor, whether the florist or model or whatever. There is no florist/model/whatever – the other vendor is, in fact, the scammer. </p>
<p>The money you pay to the other vendor will be lost because the money the scammer sent to you will be through a fraudulent credit card. The money paid to you will be reversed from your account in a few days, and you will be out of pocket. Let me restate that for emphasis: you <em>will</em> be out of pocket. There is no other vendor. It is just you and the scammer.</p>
<p>I know it might sound attractive &#8212; someone wanting to give you a lot of money and is even a little insistent on it. Just know it is a scam.</p>
<p>Here is a recent email exchange, and as you read along, you will see the progression until the scammer reveals themselves:</p>
<p>The email I received from “Cheryl Brown” at cherylbrown@allrecipess.org:</p>
<blockquote><p>I came across your website online while searching for a fashion photographer,your work seems impressive..i’m looking for an experienced Photographer to work with me on an ongoing fashion articles for family circle/allrecipe magazine..Get back to me if interested .<br />
regards<br />
Cheryl Brown</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the .org domain for “allrecipes”. Not .com but .org — that already is suspicious. Never mind the incorrect spelling of “recipes”.</p>
<p>I replied, asking where “Cheryl” is located because scammers are always (initially) vague about the location. Remember, it is a copy-and-paste email they send out.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there Cheryl,</p>
<p>What projects did you have in mind?<br />
And where are you located?</p></blockquote>
<p>Cheryl replied. Note that she didn’t answer my question. There is also now the authoritative touch of the privacy note, as many companies have in the footer of their emails. (For brevity, I deleted it from “her” other emails that I post further on.)</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m looking for an experienced photographer to work with me on an on-going fashion articles for Familycircle.I’m compiling shots for familycircle.com“fashion page” segment and we are looking for professional photographers who want to create stunning images to feature on our website- Glamour is particularly looking for outdoor and urban looks.If you’re interested this project, it is important to understand few details about the project. These are:</p>
<p>1. You will be required to work with two(2) models and one(1) hair stylist.<br />
2. There will be 4 outfits per model, 4 looks for each outfit, which<br />
totals 32 looks/images.<br />
3. Outfits/Wardrobe will be supplied by us.<br />
4. Location, date, and time will be fixed by you.<br />
5. We want 32 professionally taken pictures in High Res Digital<br />
Copies.<br />
6. Delivery date: June 30.<br />
7. Compensation: $2,400 ($800 upfront and $1,600 final payment).<br />
8. You will hold full image right (Licensor)z</p>
<p>As the photographer we want you to handle other aspect of the gig and dictate the creative direction. If you can handle this, please reply with your full name/Business name (to be written on your payment and contract), phone number, and address.</p>
<p>I will forward a contract to be signed by both parties.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Cheryl Brown<br />

<blockquote><p>You didn’t mention where you are located.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>New york</p></blockquote>
<p>The brief is still too vague, so I prod for more details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Studio work, or out on location?</p>
<p>Do you have examples of the kind of style you are going for?</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with these details, “Cheryl” also sent a number of fashion images, shot on location. I am not posting them here since they are most certainly just stolen off the internet. Remember, there is no client. It is just the scammer. Nothing is real.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response and the interest to work with us on this project. Your works are really impressive and aesthetic; I would like to work with you on this gig. There are few details you need to know:</p>
<p>Wardrobe will be picked by our stylist based on urban trends for the winter season. The stylist will also be available on the shooting date. We expect you to shoot in an urban gritty or/and natural outdoor look with clean product focused images;  I’m attaching some pictures as samples.</p>
<p>You will have to do little retouching if pictures can be taken with natural lighting. Final images will be 300dpi or larger, mix of rectangular and verticals, to be delivered via google drive or onedrive. Images will on be used as an editorial content on familycirlce.com for 12 months.</p>
<p>Could you confirm that you will be able to deliver this quality on or before the delivery date.<br />
Regards,<br />
Cheryl Brown<br />
cheryBrown@allrecipess.org Editor (9317160204</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is a copy-and-paste email. There are inconsistencies – another sure sign you are dealing with a scammer. Since I don’t have a time-machine, I ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>“6. Delivery date: June 30.”</p>
<p>I won’t be able to deliver the images before June 30, 2019<br />
So I assume this is June 30, 2020 ?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Sorry for the error in delivery date,I’ve just been informed the delivery date has been shifted to Aug 30.Please let me know if you can still deliver .</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Cheryl Brown<br />
cheryBrown@allrecipess.org Editor (9317160204</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just too easy – the entire shoot depends on my schedule and happens to be close to me. Just too convenient. So I prod a bit more:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s the delivery date.</p>
<p>The actual date of the shoot … is to be determined by me?<br />
And you will arrange for a stylist and hair &#038; makeup and all the models?</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, the scam is revealed, with the hook made even more attractive. I can make even more money now!</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi ,</p>
<p>An agency will provide a male and a female fashion model, makeup and hair stylists. I will send the agency details when I’m sending the contractual agreement. I was just informed the budget for the project has changed a little; it’s now $6,500 (photographer gets $2,400 and $4,100 for the talents). You will be paid $800 upfront plus the talents budget while your balance payment will be paid after sending us proof that the job has been done; usually watermarked images. You will be credited for the photo on our pages and you also have the full licencor right of the images.</p>
<p>Photographers we hire usually take on the responsibilities of coordinating the shoot,date for the shoot,selecting location, and disbursing fees. An advance payment of $4,900 will be issued prior to the shoot; this covers your $800 upfront and fee for talents’ fee payable to their manager.</p>
<p>If you’re comfortable with the above, let us get started. And once I get your response, we will start preparing the contractual agreement but I will still need your full name/Business name (to be written on your payment and contract), phone number, and address to prepare the contract.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Cheryl Brown<br />
cheryBrown@allrecipess.org Editor (9317160204</p></blockquote>
<p>There is the scam. They overpay you, and you reimburse the “talents”, which is really the scammer. The money they paid you will be a fraudulent transaction, and the bank will most definitely reverse the payment … and you will be out whatever you paid the “talents”/scammer.</p>
<p>In this way they will reveal themselves if you play along a little bit, feigning interest.</p>
<p>But for the love of everything that is good in the world, don’t fall for it. Don’t let the dollar signs cause you to be careless.  There is no tantalizing job opportunity. It’s just you and the scammer.</p>

<p>Check out this photo. Although it may look like a color picture upon first glance (and even more so if you squint or view it from a distance), it&#8217;s actually a black-and-white photo with thin color grid lines overlaid on it to trick your brain into filling in the missing color.</p>
<p>The viral image was created by artist and developer <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fpippin.gimp.org%2F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Øyvind Kolås</a>, a prominent developer in the GIMP open-source image editor project. Kolås took a Creative Commons photo <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fchuwa%2Falbums%2F72157627053578573" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">by Chuwa (Francis)</a>, converted it to black-and-white, and carefully overlaid red, orange, yellow, blue, and green grid lines over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;An over-saturated colored grid overlayed on a grayscale image causes the grayscale cells to be perceived as having color,&#8221; Kolås <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fposts%2F28661801" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">says</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another example Kolås created using the same technique:</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/example-800x534.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365809" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the exactly same as the way JPEG compression works, since in JPEG compression the lower resolution color signal is present for in every reconstructed pixel, in this illusion the reconstruction is happening in our eyes/mind,&#8221; Kolås writes. &#8220;[B]ut it uses the same principle that Chroma Subsampling does, that luminance is a lot more important than the chroma for our visual perception.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in playing with this concept yourself, Kolås is adding it to <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gimp.org%2F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">GIMP</a> as an operation called color-assimilation-grid, and it&#8217;ll be available starting with the next GIMP-2.10 release.</p>

<p>&#8220;The NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.8 S is a fast aperture lens ideal for all types of portrait photography and videography thanks to its edge-to-edge sharpness and beautiful, natural bokeh,&#8221; Nikon says, adding that the &#8220;fast f/1.8 constant aperture medium telephoto NIKKOR Z lens benefits from the wider, shallower Nikon Z-mount, producing edge-to-edge sharpness, even wide open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Features of the lens include a 9-blade rounded aperture for creamy bokeh, a filter size of 67mm, a minimum focusing distance of 2.62 feet (0.8m), 12 elements in 8 groups, a Nano Crystal Coating that reduces ghosting and flare, a customizable control ring, silent autofocus, and minimal focus breathing.</p>

<p>Scientists have revealed a new futuristic robotic contact lens that&#8217;s essentially an advanced zoom lens for the human eye. It can be zoomed and controlled by blinking and looking around.</p>
<p>The researchers at the University of California San Diego detailed their design in a new paper titled, &#8220;<a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fonlinelibrary.wiley.com%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1002%2Fadfm.201903762" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">A Biomimetic Soft Lens Controlled by Electrooculographic Signal</a>,&#8221; in the journal <em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>.</p>
<p>Mounted to a human eye using a set of five electrodes placed around the eyeball, the contact lens zooms in and out when the wearer double blinks. An electrical charge is applied to the polymer film layers of the lens, expanding or contracting it to change its thickness.</p>

<p>European scientists already announced <a href="https://petapixel.com/2015/03/19/new-contacts-and-glasses-give-you-2-8x-zoom-with-a-wink-of-the-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal">a blink-to-zoom 2.8x contact lens</a> back <a href="https://petapixel.com/2013/07/01/researchers-develop-a-telescopic-contact-lens-give-your-eyes-2-8x-optical-zoom/" data-wpel-link="internal">in 2013,</a> but this new contact lens goes a step further by detecting and responding to eye <em>movements</em> as well.</p>
<p>So in addition to double blinks, the contact lens can be controlled by looking in different directions (e.g. up, down, left, and right) as well, shifting as your eye moves around.</p>

<p>This technology is still in its infancy and likely still a long way away from being available for public use, but scientists say it could one day be used for everything from visual prostheses to remotely operated robotics.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/outsmartedkid-800x420.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="420" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365579" /></p>
<p>I’m an experienced concert photographer. From the largest stadiums to the smallest, dirtiest night clubs, I’ve photographed thousands of bands and seen it all. I’m damned confident in my ability to anticipate the shot and be in the right place at the right time. Or, at least I was until last Saturday night.</p>
<p>I was out to shoot the Beck and Cage the Elephant show at the Dos Equis Pavilion in south Dallas. Dos Equis is an outdoor amphitheater, with covered seating up front and a huge lawn area out back. Even with the sun going down, it’s still July in Texas; hot, sweet and sticky. 18,000 of us are waiting for Cage the Elephant to take the stage. </p>
<p>Cage the Elephant is one of the best live acts in rock and roll, driven by lead singer Matt Schultz’s willingness to get up close and personal with the fans. His brother Brad has been known to toss his guitars into the crowd. Lots of bands at this level try to control your photo rights; Cage the Elephant just warns you that they aren’t liable if you get hurt during the show.</p>
<p>There were stairs leading down from the stage to the photo pit, and we had been warned that Matt would be coming down into the pit and then out into the audience. I saw a parentless kid waiting in the front row, and in an attempt to demonstrate my superior insider’s knowledge I motioned him over and quietly told him to watch out&#8230; that Matt would be coming down from the stage into the crowd. </p>
<p>He said, &#8220;Oh&#8230; OK&#8221; but seemed less than excited. This kid:</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-1-800x503.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="503" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365569" /></p>
<p>A couple of minutes later flames go off, the show starts, and the lead singer comes out in a full yellow rain suit with a big clear umbrella.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-2-800x481.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="481" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365570" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m shooting pictures, and don&#8217;t really notice that at some point Matt has abandoned the umbrella. Then I looked back towards the crowd and see the kid holding it. Yeah, the same kid.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-3-800x553.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="553" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365571" /></p>
<p>OK, I&#8217;m getting a little suspicious, but you know, I&#8217;m busy and go back to taking pictures. During the second song, the lead singer jumps into the pit, hops the rail, and takes the wireless mic a hundred feet into the crowd. There are nine photographers in the pit and no one knows what he is going to do. </p>
<p>I take a chance and push into the spot where he jumped the barricade. At this point he is deep in the crowd, surrounded by security and cell phones. I can still see him, just barely, with the 70-200mm. Luckily he starts walking back right towards me. Then I look down and see the kid with the umbrella&#8230; <em>setting up for his shot</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-4-800x502.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="502" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365572" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-5-800x534.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365573" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-6-800x488.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="488" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365574" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-7-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365575" /></p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-8-800x533.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365576" /></p>

<p>At this point, I know I&#8217;ve been outsmarted. By a pre-teen kid. After a brief back and forth, Matt ducks into the umbrella for a selfie with “the kid”. Disengaging, he then swings right by me on his way back to the stage. In fact, he stops right in front of me and yells at the crowd. I&#8217;m snapping away, figuring I&#8217;m getting something, but all the time I&#8217;m thinking that the dang kid got the better shot. Him and Matt Schultz in an umbrella, for gosh sake! </p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/Cage-the-Elephant-kid-10-800x502.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="502" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365578" /></p>
<p>If I ever see him again, I’m going to give him a stern talking to. Then I might hand him a camera and consult him on strategy. Little bugger just might have a future in this business&#8230;</p>

<p>On July 27th, I was out taking photos and filming the moonrise behind a tower called Arctura here in Östersund, Sweden.</p>

When filming in 4K with my Nikon D500, I have a 2.25 crop factor so using it with my 600mm lens gives me an focal length equivalent of 1350mm.</p>
<p>Here’s a photo of my setup with the Nikon D500 on the left and the Nikon D850 on the right.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/IMG_20190728_004649-800x800.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365562" /></p>
<p>A couple of minutes into the moonrise, I noticed a very thin cloud in the preview of my still photos. I knew the sky was clear just minutes before so it caught my attention. A few seconds later a saw a small flashing light and realized that this was an airplane flying through my view. I quickly glanced at the LCD of my Nikon D500 and was happy to see that the airplane was inside my framing of the movie. Sometimes you just get lucky.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/airplane-800x450.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365563" /></p>
<p>Upon returning home, I did some research into what flight it was, and it turned out to be a Boeing 787 Dreamliner flying from JFK in New York to Baku in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from Flightradar24 showing the flight. Down to the left in the map, you can see the city of Östersund where I was located. I measured the distance to around 200km (124.27 miles) between me and the airplane. </p>

<p>Here’s a short movie showing the flyby as recorded by my Nikon D500. The movie is in real-time during the flyby, but otherwise it’s sped up to shorten the final movie.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/socialmediaaddictiontt-800x420.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="420" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365555" /></p>
<p>Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a new bill designed to ban the &#8220;addictive&#8221; tricks used by social networking services to hook users and increase the amount of time they spend on their platforms.</p>
<p>Hawley, a Republican senator for Missouri, says his new Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act (SMART) is meant &#8220;to prohibit social media companies from using practices that exploit human psychology or brain physiology to substantially impede freedom of choice&#8221; and to for the companies to take steps to reduce risks of Internet addiction and &#8220;psychological exploitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawley specifically targets a number of &#8220;tricks&#8221; that are widely used by services such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. These include infinite scroll (having an endless stream of content load as you scroll through it), elimination of natural stopping points, autoplay (e.g. YouTube automatically switching viewers to new videos as each one ends), and badges tied to engagement (e.g. Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.snapchat.com%2Fen-GB%2Fa%2Fsnapstreaks" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">Snapstreaks</a>, which rewards users for continuous days of sending photos to friends).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full text of the bill:</p>
<p><center><div class="fluid-iframe" style="max-width: 600px;"><div class="fluid-iframe__inner" style="padding-top:133.33%"><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" title="Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act" src="https://www.scribd.com/embeds/420250026/content?start_page=1&#038;view_mode=scroll&#038;show_recommendations=false&#038;access_key=key-L6oYlJkcgUJhrcIhOXPu" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.7729220222793488" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></center></p>
<p>Hawley has been a vocal critic of social media in the US Senate. Back in May, he <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fopinion%2F2019%2F05%2F22%2Ffacebook-instagram-twitter-do-more-harm-than-good-column%2F3751735002%2F" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">penned an op-ed in <em>USA TODAY</em></a> in which he argued that we might be better off if Instagram and other social media services &#8220;vanished.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook, Twitter, Instagram — they devote massive amounts of money and the best years of some of the nation’s brightest minds to developing new schemes to hijack their users’ neural circuitry,&#8221; Hawley writes. &#8220;That’s because social media only works — to make money, anyway — if it consumes users’ time and attention, day after day. It needs to replace the various activities we enjoyed and did perfectly well before social media existed. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8220;Let’s be clear. This is a digital drug. And the addiction is the point. Addiction is what Mark Zuckerberg is selling.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Hawley gets his way, it will become illegal for social media to serve users more content than they requested, and as a result, how we use photo-sharing services like Instagram will instantly look very, very different.</p>

<p>After the Apollo 11 mission that successfully landed the first humans on the Moon back in July 1969, a NASA photographer unexpectedly became the first non-astronaut to touch Moon dust with his bare hands.</p>
<p>Upon splashing back down on Earth, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins were immediately placed in quarantine and evaluated for weeks in case they had brought back any &#8220;bugs&#8221; from the Moon. But while that was going on, other NASA employees worked on the gear and samples that had been brought back.</p>
<p>One of these workers was NASA photographer Terry Slezak, who was tasked with unpacking the film canisters containing Moon photos. And one particular canister, Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Hasselblad 70 mm Film Magazine &#8220;S&#8221;, was accompanied by a note from Aldrin stating that the canister had been dropped on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started unpacking the film, which was double-bagged in plastic containers,&#8221; Slezak states <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fhistorycollection.jsc.nasa.gov%2FJSCHistoryPortal%2Fhistory%2Foral_histories%2FSlezakTR%2FSlezakTR_7-29-09.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">in an interview for NASA&#8217;s Oral History Project</a>. &#8220;[W]hen I came to Magazine S, I opened the Beta Cloth belt, and in there was a note from Buzz Aldrin. He said, &#8216;This is the magazine that Neil [A. Armstrong] had dropped on the surface, but this was the most important magazine.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Slezak handled the canister behind a biological barrier with his bare hands, worrying more about the dust&#8217;s potential risk to the film than to his own health.</p>
<figure id="attachment_365533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365533" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/XdeuUqSMiGBpXe6q8eqBcT-800x798.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="798" class="size-large wp-image-365533" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-365533" class="wp-caption-text">NASA photographer Terry Slezak handling the first Apollo 11 film container.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;When I pulled it out it was all covered in this black material &#8212; looked like lampblack almost &#8212; it was really dark black with little bright speckly things, which turned out to be little bits of glass from the lunar surface,&#8221; Slezak says. &#8220;So everybody said, &#8216;What is that?&#8217; I said, &#8216;It’s Moon dust. That’s the only place it’s been.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn’t really think too much about it at the time. The only thing I was concerned with was this dust, which is so abrasive, it’s like carborundum [silicon carbide (SiC)], and I was thinking, &#8216;If this stuff has gotten into the magazine, the film is going to be all scratched.&#8217; So that’s really what I was worried about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slezak was then required to pose for a photo and get decontaminated himself.</p>
<figure id="attachment_365535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365535" style="width: 794px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/K4YWauH9b62hW53c55dHfT-794x800.jpg" alt="" width="794" height="800" class="size-large wp-image-365535" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-365535" class="wp-caption-text">NASA photographer Terry Slezak posing for a photo with his fingers covered with Moon dust.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;So they had to shoot a picture of me with the Moon dust on my hand,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Then according to protocol, the other people in the room had to leave and I had to strip off my clothing and clean off all of the work surfaces with Clorox bleach, then go to the showers.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the Apollo 11 crew learned of what happened, they put together a special board commemorating the photographer&#8217;s &#8220;first contact.&#8221; The board contains six items related to the event and a signed note that reads: &#8220;To Terry Slezak, A &#8216;dirty&#8217; photographer. With best wishes.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_365537" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365537" style="width: 648px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/sothebys-com.brightspotcdn-648x800.jpg" alt="" width="648" height="800" class="size-large wp-image-365537" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-365537" class="wp-caption-text">The crew-signed presentation board. Photo by Sotheby&#8217;s.</figcaption></figure>
<p>That special presentation board was just <a href="http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2019%2Fspace-exploration%2Fapollo-11-lunar-surface-flown-film-mag-s-label-1st%3Flocale%3Den" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer">sold at a Sotheby&#8217;s auction this month for $225,000</a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how a photographer became one of the first humans to ever come in contact with Moon dust.</p>

<p>Dear Entitled, I came across a screenshot of your “I have started a photography business” post in a “Classifieds” Facebook group.</p>
<p><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/67352711_10156306078725718_8459971213790281728_o-1-303x800.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="800" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-365512" /></p>
<p>I don’t know your name, but honestly, even if I did, I wouldn’t use it. It’s not my way. But, that doesn’t mean I don’t want to address your post, because girl, I sure do. You are asking for a lot of stuff from strangers to run this business you have started and are apparently expecting to receive it, so I settled on the adjective I felt best exemplified this sort of request. I hope you don’t mind. </p>
<p>And, dear Entitled, rather than address the requests all at once, I thought I would dissect it, much like a frog in a middle school biology class. We’ll take our pins, affix this post firmly in place and then cut into it, examining it bit by bit. Exciting, right? Of course it is, just like this new business you just started. </p>
<p><strong>“I tried to make a fundraiser bit it wasn’t for a “cause” so they deleted it. But, why not make a post. My goal amount 1-2-3-4.”</strong></p>
<p>First of all, how dare they delete your fundraiser. ANIMALS! To be fair to Facebook, they probably are used to people asking for help with serious medical issues or raising money for a surgery, but anyone with a shred of common sense can see that it really is quite inconsiderate of them not to put your post asking for a camera and computer and a lump sum of money for your business on par with someone experiencing a devastating loss. I mean, does it get more inconsiderate than that? Come on, Facebook. </p>
<p><strong>“I have started a photography business.”</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations! Those are really fun words to say, aren’t they? I think the only thing more exciting is saying “I am a Professional Photographer.” And the ultra-cool thing, dear Entitled, is anyone can say them. You don’t need to validate either statement. Oh, I know, there are those naysayers who believe that just making the claim doesn’t make it so but who are they to define this dream you’ve had for ten minutes? They don’t know that you’ve thought about this all last night when you weren’t watching Netflix. Did they not read your post in the Classifieds? Those words didn’t write themselves. Yeah, the grammar is a mess, but you are busy running your new photography business, not your new “grammar business.” Am I write? Dam strait.  </p>

<p><strong>“I didn’t want to do this. I don’t have the slightest idea what to ask. These are things I need: I need a camera, not even a new one. A used camera, one that I can take and get pictures from.”</strong></p>
<p>Dear Entitled, do not beat yourself up. How can you be expected to know what you need for the new business you just opened. Hello? You are too busy running your new photography business to know what you need to run a photography business. Girl, where do you find the time? No wonder you don’t have a camera yet.  I just hope you don’t forget to care for yourself along the way. Self-care isn’t selfish.</p>
<p>As for the camera, I think you’re on the right track. I’ve always found the cameras you “can take and get pictures from” are the best cameras for a photography business. Please. And you said you don’t have the slightest idea what to ask for you. I suspect someone is riding the modesty train. </p>
<figure id="attachment_365515" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365515" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_239279057-800x620.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="620" class="size-large wp-image-365515" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-365515" class="wp-caption-text">Is this one of those Take and Get Pictures From cameras?</figcaption></figure>
<p>“I need to go out and get a laptop for editing photos, a used one, just one that allows editing. I need props, things for baby photos, things for family photos, blankets and other things.”</p>
<p>I think Best Buy sells those editing laptops. Maybe Walmart? But be warned: don’t let anyone sell you a non-editing laptop. Girl, it’s tricky, ‘cause they look the same, so stand your ground and insist on an Editing Laptop. (We call them “EL’s” but that abbreviation became confusing once Stranger Things got popular.)</p>
<p><strong>“I most definitely need a nest egg, something to assure I’ll have money set aside for expenses such as travel, small mishaps.”</strong></p>
<p>Oh, Entitled, this sentence alone tells me you are on the road to success. I mean, CLEARLY, strangers considering where to put their hard-earned money will read this and think, “Okay, this photography business owner knows her stuff. She’s already asking people to donate for her expenses. Are we SURE she’s only been doing this for 5 minutes? Let’s take the money we were going to send to our local dog rescue and send it her way to help cover her travel. You know what, that’s not enough– that kid in Guatemala can sponsor himself. This photography business owner needs money for her mishaps.” Good for you, dear Entitled. I mean, have you seen the price of business insurance? Only an idiot would buy that.</p>
<figure id="attachment_365516" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365516" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_88479094-800x534.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="size-large wp-image-365516" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-365516" class="wp-caption-text">No shoes for you today, little guy. Someone started a photography business and needs our money for a nest egg. Stay inside if it gets cold.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>“I don’t need this money immediately. I don’t need it, I want the help. I won’t be offended if you don’t want to donate. I know there are much more fundraisers more important than my own. With how life is, I don’t have the money to go out and get these things to start up my business.”</strong></p>
<p>Woah. Girl…you don’t need the money immediately? Could you possibly be MORE considerate. I mean, here you are, running your photography business, slaving away on Facebook posts and yet, you are willing to wait for the money to roll in for everything for your business. Can we clone you?</p>
<figure id="attachment_365517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365517" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock_80960876-800x534.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" class="size-large wp-image-365517" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-365517" class="wp-caption-text">“Karen, what’s wrong with you?”<br />“It’s this woman on Facebook asking everyone for money to start a business that she’s already started. She’s willing to wait for the money she wants. I mean, come on, guys. She isn’t demanding we give it to her immediately. We are not worthy…WE ARE NOT WORTHY.”<br />“Karen, seriously…what’s wrong with you?”</figcaption></figure>
<p>Listen, dear Entitled, I know you aren’t asking for a set amount of money, and again, who can blame you? I mean, really, who knows how much money is actually needed to start a photography business? Or any business. No one has ever been able to figure that out. I’m pretty sure every successful business owner has just sort of made it up as they go along. Mistakes? Please. That’s where that nest egg comes in. After all, it’s just money and there is no shortage of other people making to give to you and your dreams.</p>
<p>So, dear Entitled, in closing let me just say how happy this entire post makes me. You know, the photography industry has taken a bit of a hit lately in regards to perception. All those people calling themselves pros, holding memories so carelessly in their hands. It’s kind of devalued the whole profession, you know?</p>
<p>It’s nice to know that you really care enough to do it right. </p>
