      <title>Introducing: Ephemeral</title>
      <description>Ephemeral, a documentary podcast by Alex Williams, consists of stories that may be unfamiliar, but the themes are universal; it's a window into our own fragile, material existence that begs the question, “How will I be remembered?” This clip from the "Switchboard" episode covers WWI, women’s suffrage, and one of the most important inventions of the 20th century: the telephone. Interview with historian Elizabeth Cobbs, author of "&lt;a href="http://elizabethcobbs.com/the-hello-girls"&gt;The Hello Girls: America’s First Women Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;." The entire first season of Ephemeral is available now, and learn more at &lt;a href="https://www.ephemeral.show/episode/switchboard"&gt;www.ephemeral.show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Learn more about your ad-choices at &lt;a href='https://news.iheart.com/podcast-advertisers'&gt;https://news.iheart.com/podcast-advertisers&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Food 360</title>
      <description>Chef Marc Murphy’s debut podcast, Food 360, is a true celebration of the culinary world. With a little help from historians, fellow celebrity chefs, food writers, and more, the Chopped judge and restaurateur examines food culture from every possible angle, shedding new light on even the most familiar culinary topics. He’ll explore questions like: Why does food taste better on a white plate? How do menu layouts affect the way we order? And what does it really take to open up a restaurant? Listeners will walk away feeling smarter (and hopefully hungrier)!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listen to Food 360 &lt;a href="https://megaphone.link/HSW9557497900"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Learn more about your ad-choices at &lt;a href='https://news.iheart.com/podcast-advertisers'&gt;https://news.iheart.com/podcast-advertisers&lt;/a&gt;</description>
