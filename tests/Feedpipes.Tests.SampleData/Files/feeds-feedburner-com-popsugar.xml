&lt;p&gt;July is an important month for Special Olympics: to honor their commitment to ending discrimination against people with disabilities, the organization is continuing an important campaign called "The Revolution is Inclusion." Special Olympics is urging people to add their names to the &lt;a href="http://play.specialolympics.org/page/s/jointherevolution?source=2019stream" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://play.specialolympics.org/page/s/jointherevolution?source=2019stream" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Inclusion Pledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a promise to celebrate and include people of all abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POPSUGAR is joining forces with Special Olympics to help spread the word. On Friday, July 19, beginning at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET, POPSUGAR News and Culture Director Lindsay Miller and Max Carver will cohost a four-hour live show dedicated to celebrating togetherness alongside athletes, actors, hosts, and partners.  The show will air on &lt;a href="http://specialolympics.stageten.tv/" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://specialolympics.stageten.tv/" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;specialolympics.org/live&lt;/a&gt; and encourage viewers to sign the organization's empowering &lt;a href="http://play.specialolympics.org/page/s/jointherevolution?source=2019stream" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://play.specialolympics.org/page/s/jointherevolution?source=2019stream" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Inclusion Pledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Inside Special's Trailblazing Sex Scene With Ryan O'Connell and Brian Jordan Alvarez</title>
 <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/popsugar/~3/Pui7RRhCTGY/Ryan-OConnell-Special-Netflix-Interview-June-2019-46219928</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Ryan-OConnell-Special-Netflix-Interview-June-2019-46219928"&gt;&lt;img width="160" height="160" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/a0WcMeYi6ydb3Ipr7pUxPIHA09s/1521x72:3125x1676/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/05/31/858/n/44344577/63d4ce525cf1825035d831.66249085_.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/H4MHhRZxFlC26JCese65GrcWOI8/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/05/31/851/n/44344577/tmp_CgQ1i3_35c3563bc3218965_Special_Season1_Episode3_00_13_44_01.png" class="inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood may have a lack of imagination when it comes to the lives of gay people with disabilities, but Ryan O'Connell certainly doesn't. In O'Connell's new semi-autobiographical Netflix series, &lt;strong&gt;Special&lt;/strong&gt; - which he created, wrote, and stars in - he plays Ryan, a gay man with cerebral palsy who gradually becomes emboldened to go after what he wants in life and in love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's rare we see the stories of gay &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; disabled people play out on TV, full stop. Portrayals that reveal honest, able-yet-imperfect people with human wants and needs, whose relationships don't revolve around what others them, are ever rarer. So, to watch a gay man with cerebral palsy lose his virginity to a gentle, patient partner - a sex worker played beautifully by Brian Jordan Alvarez (of NBC's &lt;strong&gt;Will &amp;amp; Grace&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo&lt;/strong&gt; on YouTube) - charts new territory for queer representation altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a three-way call, O'Connell and Alvarez spoke to POPSUGAR about breaking new ground on &lt;strong&gt;Special&lt;/strong&gt;, putting the intimacy back in gay sex scenes, and what representation means to authentic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ePKi57aD3_QWSpf0ZQxD-WTzK8M/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/06/03/882/n/44344577/tmp_aoy7G4_e037648314c574c7_Special_Season1_Episode3_00_08_38_19xoxo.jpg" alt="Special" title="Special" class="inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POPSUGAR: Could you tell me about your process, Ryan, writing out the sex scene in episode three?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan O'Connell:&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote it with Brian in mind. I didn't ever go with anyone but Brian, knowing he would knock it out of the park. I mean, it's pretty scripted. It was all scripted, but I would say when we filmed, we definitely did improvise a lot. Well, not a lot, but we definitely did a fair amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian Jordan Alvarez:&lt;/strong&gt; That is true! I felt so free to improv on that set, and I'm so grateful that you let me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC:&lt;/strong&gt; Brian had to undress me from my f*cking suit. It took forever. And I realized: I don't have a dialogue in the script. I don't know what to say. So we had to really try to make it work. That's why, selfishly, I like to hire actors who are writers, because you get more bang for your buck. With Brian, he's a gifted writer. I'm very greedy when it comes to casting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I forgot that we did - it took so long! You were literally wearing a full suit. So we just had all this time to think about the dog, your clip-on tie. All that stuff was so fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  PS: How many times did you have to go through the motions of putting on and taking off that suit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: Ryan would know, but a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="pullquote-container"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;"It was awkward. I was genuinely very nervous."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: So, here's the thing. I wrote this, like, not understanding acting. I didn't get it - not quite. I didn't understand I'd be getting out of a suit a million times. So, when I got naked, I thought I would be calm inside, but I was like, "Let's party." I literally was like, "Fine, I don't care." I was so playful. And obviously, laying in that position, my back was very uncomfortable and I was like, "Ow." The hardest part about filming that sex scene, truly, was getting undressed and redressed. That was the most arduous task I think I ever did on the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: Ryan, you've said it was important for you to portray a more gentle, loving, sometimes even clunky side to gay sex. It felt very - hate to say this - &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; to watch. As actors, how did you go about making that scene feel realistic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: Me and Brian have both had, I think, a fair amount of sex in our lives. [laughter] We know how to have sex. It's an interesting question because there was a level of realism that we could bring to it as gay men who have had gay sex many times. We just really trusted each other through it because we both know what that's like. So, as we were going through the motions, both of us were able to act very realistically. I don't know if that's, like, the most basic thing I've ever said in my life. [laughter] We were able to act!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: But it's true: what a queer actor brings to a queer sex scene.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: That scene was so realistic in so many ways. It's very real, more than any scene I've ever shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="pullquote-container"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;"I love how the work that we put into making it feel so warm and real has paid off."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: It felt very candid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: You should see that scene on the page, because it was written like that. The credit goes to the writer, [O'Connell], who I know is on the phone. The scene was written so realistically. The first time I read it, I was just bored because, that's what I wanted. You could see that the script really goes through the motions in this realistic type of way that we don't often get to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: But also, you added things, Brian! Like, when you added the line, "Very nice body." I didn't know you were going to do that, but in the best way. It was a great, genuine reaction. And that's what I think about when I think of that scene, that most of it was genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: Shout-out to this scene, which has gotten so much love, really. Because it's one scene in the whole show, and the whole show is incredible. But I just love - in a selfish way - I love how the work that we put into making it feel so warm and real has paid off. And we shot it all in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: I shot late the night before so I hadn't gotten to see you, and I think that actually really helped for the first time. It was awkward. I was genuinely very nervous. I had never kissed you before. There was a lot of newness, and I think that really benefited the scene - that we didn't get a chance to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: Was there any trepidation for you two, going into it, and if so, did it dissipate quickly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, my God, Brian, were you nervous at all? I have this perception of you that you're so unflappable. [laughter] If you were ever nervous in that scene, you never showed it at all. You were brave, in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: I think you're right. I don't think I was nervous. I just knew you, and I know you're this genius, and I just knew it was my job to show up, and for my character to give your character as much love as possible. Really [to] just make this person in front of me completely comfortable, which I think worked on a variety of levels. I was extremely excited because you knew what you were doing when you were writing it for me, as you said you did. So, I just read it and I was like, "Oh, this is perfect for me. I literally cannot wait to get to set and do this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: When we got into it, it was so cool. We did this thing where we would cut, and he'd give me a hug or something, which would help me in a tremendous way because I'm not an actor. I've never acted before. I have a hard time coming in and out of the scene. And I'm so jealous of all the actors who are trained that know how to disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: How was that scene choreographed? How much of the movement was written into the script?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: We had a major Broadway choreographer. We were [laughter] doing the choreo for six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: Wow, it was like the &lt;strong&gt;Homecoming&lt;/strong&gt; of sex scenes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: No, how was it choreographed? Anna [Dokoza], right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, we choreographed it with Anna in my office. It was L-O-L. I had to narrate the performance for them on the couch in the middle of the day. I was like, "This is so awkward." But it was a collaboration, really. Being a gay person, I think everyone kind of knows that you know what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: Considering the outpouring of love toward &lt;strong&gt;Special&lt;/strong&gt;, what does it mean to you that, in a body of work with so many standout scenes, this one keeps floating to the surface?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: When I did voice-over for little parts to fix the audio, I got to go into this sound-recording studio to dub over little parts of the dialogue. I got to see the whole scene. I kept just gasping and my jaw kept dropping every time they would show me a different part of it. I was like, "This is one of the best things I've ever seen." And I kept literally falling to the floor. I don't know if they told you this, Ryan . . .  [laughter] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: But the first time they showed me this scene, I was just like, "What is this? This is so incredible." I was wailing and shouting. Because they were playing it on this huge screen in front of me. I was literally jaw-dropped. When we shot it, it felt amazing, and when I saw it, I was like, "Oh. I have never seen a scene like this before."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, and hopefully if we get a season two -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS: Any word on season two yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: Conversations are starting next week, so who the f*ck knows. But we're hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BJA&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm putting my bet on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RC&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, we'll see what happens. Cautiously optimistic.

 <title>Cover Story: Pretty Little Perfectionists</title>
 <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/popsugar/~3/JRId4HXAT9Q/Perfectionists-Cast-Interviews-45894982</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Perfectionists-Cast-Interviews-45894982"&gt;&lt;img width="160" height="160" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/mgG4aI95JSPBVfi45Ll8icWruoU/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/03/13/935/n/44344577/eb9ab8a35c8975a64d0ca4.83287505_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="header"&gt;Pretty Little Perfectionists&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 14, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; Maggie Panos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1″”"&gt;"I have a secret," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s2″”"&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1””"&gt; Janel Parrish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1″”"&gt;Parrish is well-versed in keeping secrets. She starred as Mona on the hit show &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s2””"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1″”"&gt; and is now reprising that role for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s2””"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1″”"&gt;, a spinoff premiering March 20. Both shows &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s3””"&gt;interrogate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1″”"&gt; the secrets that lie beneath &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s3””"&gt;otherwise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1″”"&gt; perfect facades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="”“m_3974043954701296793gmail-s1””"&gt;Parrish's secret isn't sinister, but it is poignant: "I don't read comments." Parrish has a public-facing Instagram account and a personal Facebook account just for friends and family. She knows she has to strike a balance between what she shares with fans and what she keeps private. "I don't want to feel like somebody's comments are going to affect who I am."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the hit show &lt;strong&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/strong&gt; premiered in June 2010, Instagram didn't exist, and Snapchat wasn't even in development. Nearly nine years later on the eve of &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt;' premiere, Twitter is practically a contractual requirement for actors; Instagram has ballooned to nearly 1 billion monthly users; and if you don't know how to use a Snapchat filter, you're ancient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five young stars of &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt; have amassed a collective 28 million followers on Instagram alone. When I ask about the role of social media in their lives today, they are impressively candid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Things can always look glossy and glamorous on the outside, but you never really know what somebody is dealing with on the inside," Parrish says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sofia Carson didn't even have social media until she got her first acting job. "My sister opened my Twitter and Instagram under 'Sofia Carson' handles around the time that I got &lt;strong&gt;Descendants&lt;/strong&gt;," she says, spitting her gum into a napkin and placing it gingerly on a desk. "She was like, 'Welcome to the real world.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carson became a household name - in middle schools across America, at least - with &lt;a href="http://www.popsugar.com/latest/Descendants"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Descendants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Disney Channel original movie became a ratings juggernaut, spawning two sequels (one due out later this year) and captivating tweens across America. Although the original was released just four years ago, the DCOM phenomenon sparked Carson's meteoric rise within the circles of young Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, Carson takes on the role of Ava in &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt;, where she'll meet an entirely new audience champing at the bit to see how two original cast members - Alison (Sasha Pieterse) and Mona (Parrish) - are faring after their turbulent days in Rosewood have come to a close. Ava is the queen bee, a social media maven whose schoolwork often takes a backseat to her career as an influencer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carson is one of three new leads joining the franchise as college students, along with actors Sydney Park and Eli Brown. All five actors are on the Portland, OR, set today - rotating through hair and makeup, snapping candid photos of each other, and chatting with me in a quiet corner of the Frank Manor House on the sprawling Lewis &amp; Clark College campus. It's so foggy outside the historic brick mansion that if a legion of &lt;strong&gt;Descendants&lt;/strong&gt; fans were standing 10 yards away from Carson, they likely wouldn't recognize her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Social media is a beautiful responsibility that we have as actors," Carson continues. "It's almost like a superpower to be able to connect with so many people at once, and to have such an impact. I think it's incredibly important to take it seriously."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an actor who commands the camera with such authority - she mean-mugged like a pro during a group shot - she's remarkably gentle one-on-one. She leans into me with every word; her voice is soft, and she laughs when asked about meeting Jennifer Lopez. She is wearing stark-white dad sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carson's Instagram is studded with behind-the-scenes shots from &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt;, red carpet photos from the Golden Globe Awards, and selfies with the blue wig that her character Evie sports in &lt;strong&gt;Descendants&lt;/strong&gt; ("I love it so much," she says). Her feed is professional without looking too polished, perhaps because she still runs her Instagram account herself - all the show's stars do. The platform is a way to connect with fans, but Carson is quick to assert that it only represents her public self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"'Sofia Carson' is who I am to the world, but behind closed doors, I am a version of Sofia Carson [that's] different than what you see," she says. "And I want to keep that private. I want to keep that to myself. There are certain things, especially career moments, that I want to share with the world. I pick and choose as I go, but I like to keep my romantic life and my family life private."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a completely understandable sentiment, but in a world where paparazzi park outside Starbucks and fan culture suggests that celebrities owe complete transparency, how realistic is it to keep up appearances and maintain a real sense of privacy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media fame is a double-edged sword that Sasha Pieterse knows all too well. On &lt;strong&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/strong&gt;, she played the one and only Alison, whose alleged murder kicked off the plot of the entire series. On &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt;, Alison returns as a professor at the fictional Beacon University. In the pilot episode, a character notably describes her transformation as one "from mean girl to mentor." While Pieterse spent years playing the "mean girl"  on screen, she strives to be the latter to her fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Society puts this mask on, and social media has given such a perfect outlet for that," she says. "It's very frustrating at times because everything is documented, whether it's good or bad. You have to choose what you want to be and what you want to put out there."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her post-&lt;strong&gt;PLL&lt;/strong&gt; stint on &lt;a href="http://www.popsugar.com/Dancing-with-the-Stars"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing With the Stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pieterse put something very personal "out there": her diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, a chronic hormonal disorder that can lead to female infertility. The condition affects &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/spotlights/pcos.html"&gt;up to five million women&lt;/a&gt; of reproductive age in the US alone and can contribute to the development of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, acne, and rapid weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was the first time she revealed her diagnosis publicly, Pieterse, who had gained 70 pounds, was open about her years-long struggle with weight fluctuations due to a hormonal imbalance. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/3vI3xeh0HD/"&gt;she posted an Instagram saying that she was "under construction"&lt;/a&gt; and thanked fans for their support. But by the following year, the body-shaming comments on her social media profiles had become so cruel that she &lt;a href="http://www.instagram.com/p/BH2eTjHAMWP"&gt;penned an emotional letter&lt;/a&gt;. In it, she detailed that not only had people assumed she was pregnant during the throes of her weight gain, but even after she went public with the news of her hormonal disorder, she was disturbed at the number of women who tore her down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When I finally figured out what was happening, I felt like I had to say something," she says, looking every bit a life-size porcelain doll in a pink lace dress with dark lips and flawless skin. "Not just for myself, but for awareness. So many women have PCOS and they don't even know. There are so many women that have it and don't talk about it. It's sad that it's taboo."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Pieterse wasn't initially a key player as one of the four main stars of &lt;strong&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/strong&gt;, her role grew when it turned out - spoiler alert - her character wasn't actually in the ubiquitous casket. Alison clawed her way out of her burial plot in season four, becoming a series regular until the final episode aired after seven twisty seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show was wildly successful out the gate, due in part to the rabid fanbase for Sara Shepard's book series of the same name. The YA boom was beginning to fade out on the big screen as the final Harry Potter movie was released and the penultimate Twilight took its bow, but Shepard's whodunnit story, filled with cliffhangers, lent itself to the small screen. The series snagged 4.2 million viewers for season one's Winter premiere - an immense win for Freeform (then ABC Family), and an even bigger win for Lucy Hale, Troian Bellisario, Ashley Benson, and Shay Mitchell, the show's leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While viewership remained steady in the two to three million range for years, live viewership had dropped considerably by the grand finale in 2017 - but curiously, social media engagement had not. The series's swan song generated 1.7 million tweets, &lt;a href="http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/pretty-little-liars-finale-most-tweeted-2017-1202481742"&gt;becoming one of the year's most talked-about episodes of television&lt;/a&gt;. The social media success was due in part to the stars, who would live-tweet episodes for the fans, hash out theories with critics, and share precious behind-the-scenes photos on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shepard released the first book in the Perfectionists series while &lt;strong&gt;PLL&lt;/strong&gt; was still on-air in 2015. The two book series stand alone, but Freeform has chosen to weave in characters from &lt;strong&gt;PLL&lt;/strong&gt; in hopes that it can again capture lightning in a bottle. The spinoff has the potential to be another blockbuster for the network, and the five leads again face questions of how to balance fame, reality, and an ever-growing fan appetite for social media content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young stars appeal to young audiences, and while adults may know the difference between reality and perception, kids and teens may not. If young celebrities choose to promote perfection, are they doing a disservice to fans? Do they owe it to young followers to come clean about their flaws?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You never know what someone's going through," Pieterse continues. "Assumptions are really scary - not just with PCOS or the way that I look, but the way we perceive and judge everybody before knowing what's going on in their lives. I don't think it's always negative to want to be better and want people to experience the good parts of you. That makes sense to me, but I think we've gone too far, whether it's editing your photos in Photoshop or making your life look a certain way when it may not be as perfect as you're projecting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Sasha in the "old guard" is Janel Parrish, whose character has also undergone a transformation since the early days of &lt;strong&gt;PLL&lt;/strong&gt;. Mona, once a social climber hungry for status, is now a counselor at the college. While Parrish is 30 to Pieterse's 23, both exude a quiet confidence that comes with years of juggling personal life with the demands of a successful TV show. Both got married last year, and both revealed exclusive wedding photos in high-profile magazines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parrish embraces her big sister role among the cast and feels very protective of the other actors, who she calls her "littles." But while she is the oldest cast member, she denies being the wisest: "Sasha's not much younger than me, but I always go to her for life advice because she's one of the wisest, most mature people I've ever met."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day of our interview, Parrish is energetic and eager to make eye contact. She hasn't gone through hair and makeup yet, and her beautiful bare skin indicates she's been blessed with great genes and a natural glow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ask her about how the image of fame contrasts with reality, she draws parallels between the perils of social media and the plot of her show. "Hollywood can look like - and sometimes is - a very glamorous business and a very glamorous world," Parrish says. "But people don't always see the things underneath, like the really long hours or shooting in the rain and being freezing, and pretending that it's Summer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an actor requires some amount of make-believe, and that theme extends to the themes of the show. "These perfectionists, they look so beautiful and perfect - perfect grades, the perfect couple - but there's all this darkness and struggle underneath. Trying to be a perfectionist can kind of drive you mad at times."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkness, indeed. &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt; follows a similar story arc as &lt;strong&gt;PLL&lt;/strong&gt;: a group of students in a small, idyllic town unite to unravel an all-consuming murder. In many ways it will feel familiar to fans, but the story has graduated to a new level - and not just because it takes place on a college campus. There are far more sinister things going on among the characters, and they're hinted at throughout the first episode. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is this seemingly perfect world on the exterior, and then once you crack the surface, you find imperfections and lies and darkness that we all have inside of each of us," says Carson. "I think the darkness gets heightened in our search for perfection. I think that's kind of infiltrated into everyone's world now through social media. Our world consumed by this strife for this unattainable perfection. That is harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tone of the show is ominous, but on this day, the set is filled with laughter. Some of the girls are singing along to The Beatles' "I Want to Hold Your Hand" in the hair and makeup area, dreaming aloud about macaroni salad (the kind with pineapple in it), and Eli Brown is scrolling through Instagram. His female costars have an obvious doting affection for the Hollywood newcomer, but he's still the odd man out on a set lined up with 44 pairs of heels and filled with dreamy pastel blouses. He's also not a candidate for the girls' night scheduled for that evening.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as they do on the show, each member of the cast takes on a different role within the group when the camera stops rolling. Carson is as quiet as a mouse on set (everywhere but in front of the camera), Pieterse and Parrish are chatty over prepackaged snacks, and Sydney Park is the life of the party. Her laugh can be heard from around the palatial mansion where we're shooting today. After completing her solo photo shoot to the tune of Rihanna's "Work," she's free to devour some dried mango while spitballing ideas for tonight's girls' night ritual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trader Joe's is selling mini waffle sandwiches with caramel and ice cream," says Parrish, excited by an article on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We could get those tonight," Pieterse says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I ask Park for her take on perfectionism, she's succinct, a trait likely sharpened by years of interacting with the press. While her name recognition may not be as high as that of her costars, she's been in Hollywood since 2006, when she scored a recurring role on &lt;strong&gt;That's So Raven&lt;/strong&gt; at age 9. Since then, she's appeared on numerous TV series from Nickelodeon fare like &lt;strong&gt;Instant Mom&lt;/strong&gt; to AMC's long-running hit &lt;strong&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You find yourself comparing yourself a lot to other people and their highlight reel - what you're seeing," she says. "We all do it. I'm not going to show the worst parts of me. I'm not going to show my bad days on Instagram. Some people do, but at least for what my job is, I have to keep this image, and it's a lot of pressure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's surprising to hear a wholly different take from her costars. Park recognizes the importance of seeming polished in her industry, and she's here for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's tough trying to maintain an image, whether that's being polished, or edgy, or sexy. Or, are you sexy enough? Are you pretty enough? Are you skinny enough? Are you thick enough? People are not really that forgiving out here. They always say Hollywood can just chew you up and spit you back out, and I definitely think that is an underlying theme in &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt; as well. What will you do to get ahead? What will it take? And in Hollywood, you're constantly asking yourself those questions because of the insecurities that it breeds."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt; sees Park playing Caitlin, a buttoned-up student who unwittingly stumbles onto an absolute mess of a murder. As is protocol for Sara Shepard's characters, it's clear from the get-go that Caitlin has her own trove of secrets. In contrast, Park lives her life out loud. The unrestrained actress swears like a sailor between shoots and belts out the lyrics to "Drunk in Love" during the group shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I don't really get a lot of hate, but obviously as you become more popular and people have more opinions, it's just a matter of turning your comments off. Post what you want to post, and don't worry about what everyone else says. It's not for them, really. I mean, if they have something negative to say, then that's on them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Park is the wild card, unabashed and unafraid, Eli Brown is the unsuspecting new kid on the block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 19-year-old actor, who plays the character of Dylan, was plucked out of Eugene, OR, for his first-ever onscreen role, which resulted from his first-ever audition, a fact that makes the hustling females on the cast groan in disbelief. Despite his lack of a résumé, Brown already has upwards of 35,000 followers on Instagram, where he posts a lot of black-and-white photos of idols Jeff Buckley and Jim Morrison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ask him if he's alarmed that droves of new fans have already descended upon his comments, he replies, "It's kind of crazy, and the show's not even out. It comes with a lot of attention. And I don't like being the center of attention." He says this as he's twisted himself into a pretzel in his chair, his worn gray Fender t-shirt now obscured by a tangle of limbs. When I point this out, he smiles and unfurls his slender frame.
Unlike the women of the cast, Brown isn't accustomed to press yet. He doesn't have long, thoughtful answers, and he projects a sense of apathy about how he's perceived. He's currently reading a Led Zeppelin biography - an actual paperback that may or may not be from his local library. When asked whose career he'd like his own to emulate, he says Meryl Streep (Park later laughs at this fact). The last show he watched was &lt;strong&gt;Entourage&lt;/strong&gt;, which he's seen "from start to finish several times." His least favorite part of the job is the long hours he spends waiting for something to do. While a "hurry up and wait" pace is common on TV and movie sets, that reality leaves plenty of time for Eli to read a book while his costars happily kill time on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole "I don't care what you think of me" schtick isn't a late teens defense mechanism. He seems genuinely content to be disconnected from current pop culture. When I mention &lt;strong&gt;This Is Us&lt;/strong&gt;, he asks, doe-eyed, "What's &lt;strong&gt;This Is Us&lt;/strong&gt;?" It seems his costars call him "Grandpa Eli" for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one understands the pressure these young stars will be under better than showrunner I. Marlene King. The driving force behind both &lt;strong&gt;PLL&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;The Perfectionists&lt;/strong&gt;, King is a self-professed "mama bear" to her casts.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;"We promote an on- and off-set environment where people feel like they can come to me and confide in me and just be truthful and honest," she tells me via a phone interview after the photo shoot. "We're all very supportive of each other. We call ourselves the &lt;strong&gt;PLL&lt;/strong&gt; family, and we take care of each other like a family - it's not just a word we use."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask if it's difficult to see her TV kids cope with personal struggles in the public eye, as Pieterse did with her PCOS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's not easy," she admits. "People can be very cruel on social media, and I say just ignore the negative. It's hard sometimes, but don't react to it. Ignore it. Because you don't want to give those online bullies a platform to have a dialog with you."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's right: no matter how much a celebrity shows off their life on social media, we can't purport to know them, not fully. There's a line between the Instagram fantasy and reality, albeit a blurry one (just ask Pieterse, who spoke with surprising fondness of a man in Germany who has a tattoo of her face). So what, if anything, is an actor's responsibility to their fans? What responsibility do any of us have to make the not-so-perfect details of our private lives, public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think it's to be honest," says Carson. "To be 100 percent myself and to start conversations, and to be open about topics that I think are important. I believe that true beauty lies in imperfections and in our quirks. And what makes us different and what makes us beautiful lies in being imperfect." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Editorial&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editors&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Nancy Einhart, Lisa Sugar &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Chris Roney&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Talent Booker&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Kristin Harris&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative&lt;br&gt;Photographer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Evaan &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Direction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Jenny Anna Ung &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wardrobe Styling:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Dana Avidan Cohn &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Makeup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Luce Cousineau &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Autumn Sanders &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joslin Lee, Jae Payne &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah Rudoy, Jonathan Rinkerman &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Editing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Jesse Spellman &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site Development:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Shilpa Shetty, Yilong Li, Sarabjot Kohli, Patrick McDougle, Sabrina Eldredge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/JRId4HXAT9Q" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

 <title>The Weird Role Lube and Latex Played in Transforming Christian Bale For Vice</title>
 <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/popsugar/~3/93UJFqSqSLA/Vice-Makeup-Hair-Interview-45748798</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Vice-Makeup-Hair-Interview-45748798"&gt;&lt;img width="160" height="107" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/LQGPyWTVzng0eHwLu6VfhqxsY7U/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/02/05/855/n/1922153/ab3fe62e5c59e4b3601593.24226348_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal plugs, K-Y Jelly, yellowing dental veneers - the key items scattered on set of the &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Christian-Bale-Dick-Cheney-Vice-Movie-Trailer-45339466" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Christian-Bale-Dick-Cheney-Vice-Movie-Trailer-45339466" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Academy Award-nominated film &lt;strong&gt;Vice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sound more like what you'd find in a nursing home medicine cabinet than beauty products. And yet, these are just a few of many things the &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Historical-Hair-Makeup-Design-Interview-45714777" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Historical-Hair-Makeup-Design-Interview-45714777" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;movie's makeup team&lt;/a&gt; used to transform a &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Vice-Movie-Cast-Real-People-45563938" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Vice-Movie-Cast-Real-People-45563938" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;star-studded cast&lt;/a&gt; into rising politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Christian-Bale" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/Christian-Bale" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Christian Bale&lt;/a&gt; looked nearly unrecognizable as former VP Dick Cheney, as did &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Amy-Adams" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/Amy-Adams" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Amy Adams&lt;/a&gt; as his public image-minded wife Lynne, Sam Rockwell as George W. Bush, and Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld. "We needed to create over 75 'likeness' makeups of iconic characters across five decades within a 50-day shooting schedule - these products were indispensable," hair and makeup department lead &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/k8biscoe/" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.instagram.com/k8biscoe/" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Kate Biscoe &lt;/a&gt;told POPSUGAR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="pullquote-container"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pullquote"&gt;"Throughout each decade, it was evident that Washington DC was dominated by &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clean-cut men. No one stood out and you certainly didn't get ahead in DC by looking like an individual."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating that semblance of real people became a balancing act of &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Vice-Movie-True-Story-45566612" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Vice-Movie-True-Story-45566612" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;fact versus fiction&lt;/a&gt;. "Throughout each decade, it was evident that Washington DC was dominated by &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;clean-cut men," she said. "No one stood out and you certainly didn't get ahead in DC by looking like an individual. I really wanted to juxtapose that 'cookie-cutter-ness' and the results of war in other parts of the world. So as clean and safe the DC look was, we went equally as dirty, sweaty, and bloody for all of the war scenes." Greg Cannom, the award-winning makeup designer behind Bale's transformation, added: "You can't get it exactly right, so at some point you just have to stop looking at the pictures and use your imagination to pull it off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And pull it off, they did: the team's work in &lt;strong&gt;Vice&lt;/strong&gt; was just &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Oscar-Nominations-2019-45697043" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Oscar-Nominations-2019-45697043" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;nominated for an Oscar&lt;/a&gt; in the Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling category. Ahead, they're spilling all the behind-the-scenes beauty secrets, which - like most things kept behind closed doors in politics - are pretty damn juicy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/93UJFqSqSLA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

We also witnessed some truly significant pop culture moments, like &lt;strong&gt;Black Panther&lt;/strong&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Black-Panther-Box-Office-Records-44602209" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Black-Panther-Box-Office-Records-44602209" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;box-office impact&lt;/a&gt;, and did you hear about this couple named &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Royal-Wedding-2018" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/Royal-Wedding-2018" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Harry and Meghan&lt;/a&gt; who got married? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, all these disparate happenings gave us plenty of &lt;a class="sugar-inline-link ga-track" title="Latest photos and news for Halloween" href="https://www.popsugar.com/Halloween" target="_blank" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/Halloween" data-ga-action="&amp;lt;-related-&amp;gt; Links"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; costume inspiration. Each year, POPSUGAR predicts - nay, determines - the costumes that are sure to be everywhere come Oct. 31. This year was no different, and with events like the &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Met-Gala" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/Met-Gala" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Met Gala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Beyoncé-Coachella-Performance-2018-Pictures-44748014" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Beyonc%C3%A9-Coachella-Performance-2018-Pictures-44748014" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Beychella&lt;/a&gt;, we had it pretty easy. Of course, we also threw in some wild cards for good measure. (Ahem, allow us to repeat: Walmart Yodel Boy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tapping into our editors' knowledge of the last year, creative brainpower, and passion, POPSUGAR presents the top 10 Halloween costumes inspired by this year's trends, plus tips on how to re-create them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/nGBX6XXYKTg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

 <title>Army Sisters Help Vets Repurpose Military Surplus Into Chic Apparel</title>

Obsessed with everything fashion, the dynamic duo came together to launch &lt;a href="http://www.swordandplough.com/" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://www.swordandplough.com/" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Sword &amp;amp; Plough&lt;/a&gt;, a socially-minded fashion brand that repurposes thousands of pounds of military surplus into stylish, durable bags and accessories. Inspired by their father and Emily's own work as an active duty army officer, Sword &amp;amp; Plough not only repurposes military material, but hires veterans as manufacturers and donates 10 percent of its profits to organizations that benefit veterans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/2MpjRHJePUo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

 <title>I Was Able to Go Makeup-Free on Vacation All Because of This Key Serum</title>
 <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/popsugar/~3/GyNeHGs0ETo/How-Go-Makeup-Free-45118140</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/How-Go-Makeup-Free-45118140"&gt;&lt;img width="160" height="160" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/QgN7EMOYNaQNTHdgUFe9weqCDuw/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/07/31/845/n/44344577/a4fc1a855b60b5f2325b48.55624203_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/w70uk7oU607lk78PNgGFqukzyh4/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/07/31/905/n/1922153/tmp_e39X2Q_5e9a7ac694e77843_popsugar_nantucket-76.jpg" class="inline"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never been a real makeup junkie, but I've always appreciated a well-made-up face. I started wearing lip gloss at 12, eyeliner at 13 (sorry mom, I snuck it in my backpack and put it on at school each morning), and by 18 I was applying my face each morning prior to heading off to class. But each Summer, I gave my face a break as I spent my days lifeguarding at the neighborhood pool. There, all I needed was some sunscreen, a hot pair of sunglasses, and a strong whistle I could twirl around my fingers while perched above the splashing kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a dozen or so years, and all of that changed. My years in the sun, and my haphazard sunscreen application, had taken their toll. Sunspots, the early signs of wrinkles and crow's feet, and leftover acne scars left me covering up my face every chance I got. Even in the sweltering dog days of Summer, you wouldn't catch me without a layer of foundation - or a rather thick tinted moisturizer - on my face, even if I was just taking a walk in the park. I really didn't mind it, it was just part of my routine. But I was insanely jealous of all of those girls who posted photos where they looked casual, relaxed, and makeup-free on their warm-weather vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/WTGl4g-yXHPnStrJ83GuDitcXTU/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/07/31/839/n/44344577/tmp_MGS5Jr_a4a7f3ebb9f576bf_PS18_NantucketSummerHouse_NativePost_Image_03.png" class="inline"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was determined to be one of them, but wasn't sure where to start until I was invited to visit POPSUGAR's Nantucket House last month. The house was sponsored by philosophy, and the brand sent me their new &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/renewed%20hope%20in%20a%20jar%20renewing%20dew%20concentrate-353907?p_name=renewed%20hope%20in%20a%20jar%20renewing%20dew%20concentrate&amp;amp;retailer=philosophy.com&amp;amp;pid=353907&amp;amp;price=45&amp;amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;amp;evar9=45118140&amp;amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2FHow-Go-Makeup-Free-45118140&amp;amp;list1=philosophy%2Csummer%2Cshoppable%2Cskin%20care&amp;amp;prop13=api&amp;amp;pdata=1" rel="nofollow" data-shoppable-link="1" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://www.philosophy.com/renewed-hope-in-a-jar-dew-serum.html" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;renewed hope in a jar renewing dew concentrate&lt;/a&gt; ($45) as well as their revered &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/renewed%20hope%20in%20a%20jar%20moisturizer%20SPF-353908?p_name=renewed%20hope%20in%20a%20jar%20moisturizer%20SPF&amp;amp;retailer=philosophy.com&amp;amp;pid=353908&amp;amp;price=39&amp;amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;amp;evar9=45118140&amp;amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2FHow-Go-Makeup-Free-45118140&amp;amp;list1=philosophy%2Csummer%2Cshoppable%2Cskin%20care&amp;amp;prop13=api&amp;amp;pdata=1" rel="nofollow" data-shoppable-link="1" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://www.philosophy.com/renewed-hope-spf-30.html?cgid=C112" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;renewed hope in a jar moisturizer SPF&lt;/a&gt; ($39) to try in advance of my trip. The serum was developed as an introduction to a skincare routine for women who are starting to worry about wrinkles and lines before actually having them. In other words, me. For the week prior to the trip, I applied a few drops of the serum to my fingertips each morning and night, then gently patted them on my face. Once the serum was absorbed, I smoothed the moisturizer on top - the renewed hope in a jar spf with SPF 30 for day and the &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/renewed%20hope%20in%20a%20jar%20overnight%20recharging%20%26amp%3B%20refining%20moisturizer-353909?p_name=renewed%20hope%20in%20a%20jar%20overnight%20recharging%20%26amp%3B%20refining%20moisturizer&amp;amp;retailer=philosophy.com&amp;amp;pid=353909&amp;amp;price=49&amp;amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;amp;evar9=45118140&amp;amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2FHow-Go-Makeup-Free-45118140&amp;amp;list1=philosophy%2Csummer%2Cshoppable%2Cskin%20care&amp;amp;prop13=api&amp;amp;pdata=1" rel="nofollow" data-shoppable-link="1" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://www.philosophy.com/renewed-hope-in-a-jar-night.html?cgid=C112" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;renewed hope in a jar overnight recharging &amp;amp; refining moisturizer&lt;/a&gt; ($49) for night. The whole routine took a total of two minutes each time. I didn't see how four minutes of work could makeover my skin, but it actually did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/0R3kZY_8bLASDE1jbq1qkFo8l6M/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/07/31/839/n/44344577/tmp_IPZqBD_b1cf38699529ecae_PS18_NantucketSummerHouse_NativePost_Image_01.png" class="inline"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't been paying much attention to my skin's transformation until I was sitting with some bloggers on day two of our trip. The schedule was packed, and we had just finished a barre class when we had to quickly shower, get dressed, and hop in a taxi to head down to tugboat ride around the harbor. The rush left me without a minute to spare, and as I glanced at my postshower face in the mirror, I noticed that my skin was actually glowing. The spots I'd been meticulously covering up didn't seem quite as dark and didn't need to be covered up. My skin was soft and moisturized and actually radiant. Nervous (as I knew we'd be taking a ton of photos on the boat ride) but excited, I ran a brush through my hair, threw on a pair of sunglasses, and headed out the door. My travel mates marveled at my swift transition and commented that I looked fresh and dewy. I quickly forgot that I was makeup-free and simply enjoyed the remainder of the day as we sailed around the harbor and marveled at the yachts docked in the marina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ChovykJ5ws6YPd31yI8-au8DReI/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/07/31/839/n/44344577/tmp_u1IdzR_89f5857c7b631207_PS18_NantucketSummerHouse_NativePost_Image_02.png" class="inline"&gt;Emboldened by my easy routine, the next day my husband and I set out to explore another part of the island, the old whaling village affectionately known as 'Sconset. Rather than wait for me to "apply my face" before heading out for the day, I surprised him when I beat him to the door after applying my new two-minute morning routine of serum and moisturizer with sunscreen. Not only was I ready faster than ever before, I was beginning to resemble those carefree vacation pics I'd been drooling over all those years. Without worrying about my foundation wearing off throughout the day and what my skin looked like under it, I was relaxed as we made our way along the Bluff Walk that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/qA-IY1fsLRnrSzS1wm4FW0MqkYM/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/07/31/840/n/44344577/tmp_YLsN78_890738b8ef849325_PS18_NantucketSummerHouse_NativePost_Image_04.png" class="inline"&gt;Who would have thought that aging would give me the confidence I needed to go makeup-free? Certainly not me. But with a strong skincare routine - even if it only takes four minutes a day - that's just what's happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/GyNeHGs0ETo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

 <title>Bella Hadid Denies That Drake's "Finesse" Is About Her: "That's Disrespectful"</title>
 <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/popsugar/~3/06NGXtVdXko/Drake-Song-Finesse-About-Bella-Hadid-45000472</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Drake-Song-Finesse-About-Bella-Hadid-45000472"&gt;&lt;img width="160" height="160" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/SfU8wMdaiPbeTRZstj4JD2UXjWI/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/06/29/142/n/44344577/b9631d425b36ea08388ec6.61334467_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Ot8mTfdv4RYGuZBkcNZSYXjjdMo/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/06/29/142/n/44344577/tmp_U1Zua5_514b9336335912a5_bella.jpg" class="inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not Drake and Bella Hadid ever actually dated, the 21-year-old supermodel is setting the record straight about one thing: &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Drake-Lyrics-About-Bella-Hadid-Scorpion-Album-44999512" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Drake-Lyrics-About-Bella-Hadid-Scorpion-Album-44999512" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Drake's new song is not about her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Canadian rapper &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Reactions-Drake-Album-Scorpion-44998159" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Reactions-Drake-Album-Scorpion-44998159" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;dropped a two-sided album, &lt;strong&gt;Scorpion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that boasts 25 songs and lasts an hour and 29 minutes, but it was the track "Finesse," in particular, that captured the attention of fans. In the song, Drake alludes to a relationship with a woman who has a lot in common with Hadid, from her career ("Fashion Week is more your thing than mine") to her sister and fellow model, Gigi ("You and your sister / Too hot to handle").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the similarities, Hadid hopped on Twitter to make it clear that the woman Drake raps about is not her, with the help of a few angry emoji. "Not me!!!" she wrote after someone insinuated Drake had "banged" her. "That's disrespectful. WHY CANT PPL BE FRIENDS W/o all the insinuation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not me!!!&#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;‍♀️that's disrespectful. WHY CANT PPL BE FRIENDS W/o all the insinuation &#x1f92d;&#x1f9d0;&#x1f629;&#x1f92c;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bellahadid/status/1012764155458281473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://twitter.com/bellahadid/status/1012764155458281473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;June 29, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The 31-year-old rapper has rarely been photographed with Hadid, but he sparked dating rumors in October 2017 after paying for and hosting her 21st birthday. Most recently, Hadid has been &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Bella-Hadid-Weeknd-Kissing-Cannes-Party-May-2018-44835008" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Bella-Hadid-Weeknd-Kissing-Cannes-Party-May-2018-44835008" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;spotted getting cozy&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Bella-Hadid-Weeknd-Relationship-Timeline-44836563" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Bella-Hadid-Weeknd-Relationship-Timeline-44836563" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;her ex-boyfriend, The Weeknd&lt;/a&gt;, so it doesn't seem a relationship with Drake - who &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Drake-Lyrics-About-His-Son-His-Album-Scorpion-44997969" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Drake-Lyrics-About-His-Son-His-Album-Scorpion-44997969" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;just confirmed he's a father&lt;/a&gt; - is on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/06NGXtVdXko" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

On June 30, Tom and Dustin shared the exciting news that their son had been born a few days earlier on June 27 with two very touching posts on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The most magical moment of my life," the Olympic diver wrote. "The amount of love and joy you have brought into our life is immeasurable. Our precious son." Meanwhile, Dustin, an Oscar-winning screenwriter, wrote, "Thank you for bringing so much love and light with you. And thank you to those who helped make our dream of having a family into this wonderful reality." &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>My Husband Will Just Have to Deal With This "F*cking Terrifying" Mask, Because It Works</title>
 <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/popsugar/~3/i-a3tlotk6A/Dr-Jart-Rubber-Mask-Review-44664632</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Dr-Jart-Rubber-Mask-Review-44664632"&gt;&lt;img width="160" height="160" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/nMujn1YhoSsUPZS-Sbo-lTWgCFE/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/03/14/918/n/44344577/b758e0695aa98de6b5cdd1.93656283_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/5sdB80OyKFtzNzPO8EoaENDivVk/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/03/13/075/n/44344577/tmp_AwPlXU_06c707697f03510b_1021-3005487-DM50_M.jpg" class="inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a mask that will soothe your skin while openly repelling any and all love interests, man, have I got the product for you. While &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Dr-Jart-Shake-Shot-Rubber-Mask-Review-44581714" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Dr-Jart-Shake-Shot-Rubber-Mask-Review-44581714" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Dr. Jart's Shake and Shot Mask has been all the rage lately&lt;/a&gt;, I still hadn't gotten my hands on its predecessor, the original Rubber Mask. As a lover of all &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Hanacure-Mask-Review-44119206" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Hanacure-Mask-Review-44119206" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;temporarily horrifying skincare treatments&lt;/a&gt;, I longed to try it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the options - the sunshine yellow &lt;a href="http://www.qvc.com/Dr-Jart%2B-Bright-Lover-Rubber-Mask.product.A359318.html" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://www.qvc.com/Dr-Jart%2B-Bright-Lover-Rubber-Mask.product.A359318.html" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Bright Lover&lt;/a&gt;, the slate gray &lt;a href="http://www.qvc.com/Dr-Jart%2B-Clear-Skin-Lover-Rubber-Mask.product.A359322.html" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://www.qvc.com/Dr-Jart%2B-Clear-Skin-Lover-Rubber-Mask.product.A359322.html" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Clear Skin Lover&lt;/a&gt;, and the bubblegum pink &lt;a href="http://www.qvc.com/Dr-Jart%2B-Firm-Lover-Rubber-Mask.product.A359320.html" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://www.qvc.com/Dr-Jart%2B-Firm-Lover-Rubber-Mask.product.A359320.html" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Firm Lover&lt;/a&gt; - I settled on the most popular version, the baby blue &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Hydration%20Lover-277302?p_name=Hydration%20Lover&amp;amp;retailer=sephora.com&amp;amp;pid=277302&amp;amp;price=12&amp;amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;amp;evar9=44664632&amp;amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2FDr-Jart-Rubber-Mask-Review-44664632&amp;amp;list1=face%20masks%2Cbeauty%20review%2Cbeauty%20products%20review%2Coriginal%20photos%2Csyndicate%2Cpopsugar%20voices%2Coriginal%20feature%2Cwriteathon%2Cshoppable%2Cdr.%20jart%2Cskin%20care&amp;amp;prop13=api&amp;amp;pdata=1" rel="nofollow" data-shoppable-link="1" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.sephora.com/product/hydration-lover-rubber-mask-P418172" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Hydration Lover&lt;/a&gt; ($12). Each type of mask contains slightly different ingredients targeted to treat your skin's specific needs, and my skin is constantly lacking in moisture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mask is basically a two-step process, consisting of a concentrated serum layered under a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kXpUaQpXMA" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kXpUaQpXMA" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;Goodnight Mommy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;-esque "rubber" mask. I washed my face with some gentle cleanser before applying the clear serum, which comes in a pack with the mask. The Hydration Mask's serum features a Keratin complex, which supposedly helps with moisture retention and skin's elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/fic693Y2XXnn379J1WlFB-baQMY/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/03/13/060/n/44344577/tmp_pT5ybj_435ccc8e3867823b_FACE.JPG" class="inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mask itself may look and feel like rubber, but it's actually composed of good-for-your-skin stuff like seaweed extract (which contains vitamin C) and brown algae. It's broken into two pieces that you smooth over the top and bottom halves of your face. You will likely have some parts overlapping, and a little bit over your hairline. I did appreciate that it wasn't one big sheet; as one size often does not fit all when it comes to faces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set a timer for 20 minutes, and waited for my husband to find me. Eventually he wandered in and, spooked, exclaimed, "Well, that's f*cking terrifying."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After washing it off, I felt and saw little difference - until the next day. My skin looked brighter and clearer, and felt, dare I say, quenched. The mask isn't reusable (please don't try to dry it out and wear it again, weirdo), so I'm considering trying another version. If the Hydration Lover zapped my blooming blemishes, what wonders could the Clear Skin Lover do?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave you with this image. Use it to scare your children at will. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Kit Harington Is Cutting Off All His Hair When Game of Thrones Ends, and We Need a Minute</title>
 <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/popsugar/~3/FzK7woKc6e4/Kit-Harington-Cutting-His-Hair-After-Game-Thrones-Ends-44958925</link>
 <description>&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Kit-Harington-Cutting-His-Hair-After-Game-Thrones-Ends-44958925"&gt;&lt;img width="160" height="160" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/dN_SP1f-27n6sq6VuUXZk_61dPo/fit-in/160x160/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/06/19/740/n/1922283/f168ce525b29333f196051.63624441_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/5JosIX89CPDLY7SKla6SWnNv8CM/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/06/19/739/n/1922283/tmp_G2D8as_992c34976dbd4c12_hair.jpg" class="inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think of the Jon Snow, a few things inevitably come to mind: &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Sexy-Jon-Snow-Game-Thrones-GIFs-43917603" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Sexy-Jon-Snow-Game-Thrones-GIFs-43917603" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;a brooding stare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Game-Thrones-Night-Watch-Costume-43845821" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Game-Thrones-Night-Watch-Costume-43845821" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;a massive furry coat&lt;/a&gt;, and a curly mop of hair. Sadly the latter trait is going to disappear right along with the character when &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Game-of-Thrones" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/Game-of-Thrones" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/When-Game-Thrones-End-40951104" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/When-Game-Thrones-End-40951104" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;ends next year&lt;/a&gt;, and Kit Harington couldn't be happier about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 31-year-old actor has played the Night's Watch commander and &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Does-Jon-Outrank-Dany-Game-Thrones-43884480" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Does-Jon-Outrank-Dany-Game-Thrones-43884480" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;heir to the Iron Throne&lt;/a&gt; since the HBO fantasy series premiered back in 2011, which means he hasn't been able to cut his hair for the past seven years or so. During a recent interview &lt;a href="http://ew.com/tv/2018/06/19/kit-harington-game-of-thrones-hair-plan/" target="_blank" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="http://ew.com/tv/2018/06/19/kit-harington-game-of-thrones-hair-plan/" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;with &lt;strong&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he revealed he can't wait to ditch the curls for a shorter 'do, despite loving his time in the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="related-stories clearfix"&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/When-Does-Season-8-Game-Thrones-Start-43951025" class="related-link related-link-with-image "&gt;
            &lt;div class="related-poster"&gt;
                                    &lt;img alt="When Does Season 8 of Game of Thrones Start?" class="image smallsquare" width="75" height="75" src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/vuiuDpTwpPJR2vD8vNscHQ3i8RA/75x75/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:sharpen-!1,0,true!-/2017/08/29/887/n/1922283/40d9477d59a5cc194b4633.93316178_edit_img_image_17268548_1504037693/i/When-Does-Season-8-Game-Thrones-Start.jpg" title="When Does Season 8 of Game of Thrones Start?"&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;

            When Does Season 8 of Game of Thrones Start? Well, We've Got News . . .
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'd like to step away and enjoy the obscurity, cut my hair, make myself less recognizable as the character, and go do and some other things with a completely new look and tone," Harington said, noting that he's going "short-short" with the length. "The beard will be harder to get rid of - I quite like the beard. I like having the long hair and beard both, but it will be like ritualistic thing. I can't go into my next role looking the same. This role was brilliant, but I'll need to get rid of Jon Snow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/uy6UIYE6eNoptWM2IYoNmAZxIS8/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/06/19/738/n/1922283/tmp_xswyCk_d1d6b4e8ee03d60e_hair.gif" class="inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Harington &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get to cut off a tiny bit of his hair during the break between seasons five and six, which had fans speculating that Jon had truly died from the stab wounds he sustains in that whole Night's Watch mutiny. Fortunately he returned and has been kicking ass, taking names, and &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/love/Jon-Snow-Daenerys-Sex-Scene-Game-Thrones-43937684" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://www.popsugar.com/love/Jon-Snow-Daenerys-Sex-Scene-Game-Thrones-43937684" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;unknowingly sleeping with his aunt&lt;/a&gt; ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/FzK7woKc6e4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

Here's a little bit more about what we're looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Our purpose&lt;/strong&gt; is to promote diverse voices and perspectives not only through the people and stories we cover, but also through the voices we are highlighting and seeking out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Our content&lt;/strong&gt; represents a diversity of viewpoints, sexual orientations, and religions. It's translated for the beginner but is still interesting to the expert. We support body-positivity and sex-positivity, women's equality, women's right to choose, and feminism in and out of the workplace. We embrace women of all sizes and ages. We support women being their best selves. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Our tone&lt;/strong&gt; is friendly, upbeat, encouraging, optimistic, open-minded, and professional. We are friends giving advice and in the know, but we're not know-it-alls. Stories are written with a positive spin; we approach topics as fans, not critics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you and you can't wait any longer to get started, &lt;a href="https://voices.popsugar.com/" class="ga-track" data-ga-category="Related" data-ga-label="https://voices.popsugar.com/" data-ga-action="In-Line Links"&gt;learn more about how you can join our Voices team here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/popsugar/~4/THz3EH_RN5s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
