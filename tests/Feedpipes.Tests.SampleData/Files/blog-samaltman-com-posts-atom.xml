    <title>How To Be Successful</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter.<br></p><p> </p><p>Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to anyone.</p><p><b>1. Compound yourself</b></p><p>Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.</p><p> </p><p>A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.</p><p> </p><p>You also want to be an exponential curve yourself—you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. It’s important to move towards a career that has a compounding effect—most careers progress fairly linearly.</p><p> </p><p>You don't want to be in a career where people who have been doing it for two years can be as effective as people who have been doing it for twenty—your rate of learning should always be high. As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people.</p><p> </p><p>It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.</p><p> </p><p>Most people get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes. </p><p> </p><p>I think the biggest competitive advantage in business—either for a company or for an individual’s career—is long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together. One of the notable aspects of compound growth is that the furthest out years are the most important. In a world where almost no one takes a truly long-term view, the market richly rewards those who do.</p><p> </p><p>Trust the exponential, be patient, and be pleasantly surprised.</p><p><b>2. Have almost too much self-belief</b></p><p> </p><p>Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.</p><p> </p><p>Cultivate this early. As you get more data points that your judgment is good and you can consistently deliver results, trust yourself more.</p><p> </p><p>If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created.</p><p> </p><p>I remember when Elon Musk took me on a tour of the SpaceX factory many years ago. He talked in detail about manufacturing every part of the rocket, but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking “huh, so that’s the benchmark for what conviction looks like.”</p><p> </p><p>Managing your own morale—and your team’s morale—is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. It’s almost impossible without a lot of self-belief. And unfortunately, the more ambitious you are, the more the world will try to tear you down.  </p><p> </p><p>Most highly successful people have been really right about the future at least once at a time when people thought they were wrong. If not, they would have faced much more competition.</p><p> </p><p>Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. I used to hate criticism of any sort and actively avoided it. Now I try to always listen to it with the assumption that it’s true, and then decide if I want to act on it or not. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.</p><p> </p><p>This balance also helps you avoid coming across as entitled and out of touch.</p><p><b>3. Learn to think independently</b></p><p> </p><p>Entrepreneurship is very difficult to teach because original thinking is very difficult to teach. School is not set up to teach this—in fact, it generally rewards the opposite. So you have to cultivate it on your own.</p><p> </p><p>Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.</p><p> </p><p>“I will fail many times, and I will be really right once” is the entrepreneurs’ way. You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky.</p><p> </p><p>One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. The more times you do this, the more you will believe it. Grit comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down.</p><p><b>4. Get good at “sales”</b></p><p>Self-belief alone is not sufficient—you also have to be able to convince other people of what you believe.</p><p> </p><p>All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. You have to evangelize your plans to customers, prospective employees, the press, investors, etc. This requires an inspiring vision, strong communication skills, some degree of charisma, and evidence of execution ability.</p><p> </p><p>Getting good at communication—particularly written communication—is an investment worth making. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language.</p><p> </p><p>The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. Selling what you truly believe in feels great, and trying to sell snake oil feels awful.</p><p> </p><p>Getting good at sales is like improving at any other skill—anyone can get better at it with deliberate practice. But for some reason, perhaps because it feels distasteful, many people treat it as something unlearnable. </p><p> </p><p>My other big sales tip is to show up in person whenever it’s important. When I was first starting out, I was always willing to get on a plane. It was frequently unnecessary, but three times it led to career-making turning points for me that otherwise would have gone the other way.</p><p> </p><p><b>5. Make it easy to take risks</b></p><p> </p><p>Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. Taking risks is important because it’s impossible to be right all the time—you have to try many things and adapt quickly as you learn more.</p><p> </p><p>It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain. Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction.</p><p> </p><p>Don’t save up for too long, though. At YC, we’ve often noticed a problem with founders that have spent a lot of time working at Google or Facebook. When people get used to a comfortable life, a predictable job, and a reputation of succeeding at whatever they do, it gets very hard to leave that behind (and people have an incredible ability to always match their lifestyle to next year’s salary). Even if they do leave, the temptation to return is great. It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment.  </p><p> </p><p>But when you aren’t on the treadmill, you can follow your hunches and spend time on things that might turn out to be really interesting. Keeping your life cheap and flexible for as long as you can is a powerful way to do this, but obviously comes with tradeoffs.</p><p><b>6. Focus</b></p><p>Focus is a force multiplier on work.</p><p> </p><p>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p><p> </p><p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.</p><p><b>7. Work hard</b></p><p>You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both—you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot. </p><p> </p><p>Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success.</p><p> </p><p>And it’s often really fun. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. A YC founder recently expressed great surprise about how much happier and more fulfilled he was after leaving his job at a big company and working towards his maximum possible impact. Working hard at that should be celebrated.  </p><p> </p><p>It’s not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in certain parts of the US, but this is certainly not the case in other parts of the world—the amount of energy and drive exhibited by entrepreneurs outside of the US is quickly becoming the new benchmark.</p><p> </p><p>You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. People find their own strategies for this, but one that almost always works is to find work you like doing with people you enjoy spending a lot of time with.</p><p> </p><p>I think people who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. In fact, work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success.</p><p> </p><p>One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have for the benefits to pay off. It’s also easier to work hard when you have fewer other responsibilities, which is frequently but not always the case when you’re young.</p><p><b>8. Be bold</b></p><p>I believe that it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.</p><p> </p><p>If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don’t be afraid to work on what you really want to work on.</p><p> </p><p>If everyone else is starting meme companies, and you want to start a gene-editing company, then do that and don’t second guess it.</p><p> </p><p>Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too.</p><p><b>9. Be willful</b></p><p>A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are.</p><p>People have an enormous capacity to make things happen. A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.</p><p> </p><p>Ask for what you want. You usually won’t get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well. </p><p> </p><p>Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p><p> </p><p>Airbnb is my benchmark for this. There are so many stories they tell that I wouldn’t recommend trying to reproduce (keeping maxed-out credit cards in those nine-slot three-ring binder pages kids use for baseball cards, eating dollar store cereal for every meal, battle after battle with powerful entrenched interest, and on and on) but they managed to survive long enough for luck to go their way.</p><p> </p><p>To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p><p><b>10. Be hard to compete with</b></p><p>Most people understand that companies are more valuable if they are difficult to compete with. This is important, and obviously true.</p><p> </p><p>But this holds true for you as an individual as well. If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money.</p><p> </p><p>The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it.</p><p> </p><p>Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with.</p><p><b>11. Build a network</b></p><p>Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish.</p><p> </p><p>An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Doing this, over a long period of time, is what lead to most of my best career opportunities and three of my four best investments. I’m continually surprised how often something good happens to me because of something I did to help a founder ten years ago.</p><p> </p><p>One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside; it will come back to you 10x. Also, learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (This is the most important thing I have learned about management, and I haven’t read much about it.) You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. “I can’t do X because I’m not good at Y” is something I hear from entrepreneurs surprisingly often, and almost always reflects a lack of creativity. The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are.</p><p> </p><p>A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice. The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment.</p><p> </p><p>I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things.</p><p> </p><p>A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!)</p><p> </p><p>Finally, remember to spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions.</p><p> </p><p><b>12. You get rich by owning things</b></p><p>The biggest economic misunderstanding of my childhood was that people got rich from high salaries. Though there are some exceptions—entertainers for example —almost no one in the history of the Forbes list has gotten there with a salary.</p><p> </p><p>You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value.</p><p> </p><p>This can be a piece of a business, real estate, natural resource, intellectual property, or other similar things. But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly.</p><p> </p><p>The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale. </p><p><b>13. Be internally driven</b></p><p>Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones.</p><p> </p><p>First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks.  You will care a lot—much more than you realize—if other people think you’re doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You’ll be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term.</p><p> </p><p>Smart people seem to be especially at risk of such externally-driven behavior. Being aware of it helps, but only a little—you will likely have to work super-hard to not fall in the mimetic trap.</p><p> </p><p>The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. After you’ve made enough money to buy whatever you want and gotten enough social status that it stops being fun to get more, this is the only force I know of that will continue to drive you to higher levels of performance.</p><p> </p><p>This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it. </p><p> </p><p>Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham are my benchmarks for this. YC was widely mocked for the first few years, and almost no one thought it would be a big success when they first started. But they thought it would be great for the world if it worked, and they love helping people, and they were convinced their new model was better than the existing model.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with.</p><br>[1] A comment response I wrote on HN:<div><br></div><div>One of the biggest reasons I'm excited about basic income is the amount of human potential it will unleash by freeing more people to take risks.<p>Until then, if you aren't born lucky, you have to claw your way up for awhile before you can take big swings. If you are born in extreme poverty, then this is super difficult :(</p>
<p>It is obviously an incredible shame and waste that opportunity is so unevenly distributed. But I've witnessed enough people be born with the deck stacked badly against them and go on to incredible success to know it's possible.</p>I am deeply aware of the fact that I personally would not be where I am if I weren't born incredibly lucky.<div>

    <title>Reinforcement Learning Progress</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Today, <a href="https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/">OpenAI released a new result</a>.  We used PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), a general reinforcement learning algorithm invented by OpenAI, to train a team of 5 agents to play Dota and beat semi-pros.</p>
<p>This is the game that to me feels closest to the real world and complex decision making (combining strategy, tactics, coordinating, and real-time action) of any game AI had made real progress against so far.</p>
<p>The agents we train consistently outperform two-week old agents with a win rate of 90-95%.  We did this without training on human-played games—we did design the reward functions, of course, but the algorithm figured out how to play by training against itself.</p>
<p>This is a big deal because it shows that deep reinforcement learning can solve extremely hard problems whenever you can throw enough computing scale and a really good simulated environment that captures the problem you’re solving.  We hope to use this same approach to solve very different problems soon.  It's easy to imagine this being applied to environments that look increasingly like the real world.</p>
<p>There are many problems in the world that are far too complex to hand-code solutions for.  I expect this to be a large branch of machine learning, and an important step on the road towards general intelligence.</p></div>]]>

    <title>US Digital Currency</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I am pretty sure cryptocurrency is here to stay in some form (at least as a store of value, which is the only use case we have seen work at scale so far).  There was possibly a time when governments could have totally stopped it, but it feels like that’s in the rearview mirror.<br></p><p> </p><p>However, I think it’s very possible that the dominant cryptocurrency hasn’t been created yet (Google was years late to the search engine party, and Facebook came long after most people assumed the social network wars were won).  And from the perspective of a nation, there are real problems with current systems, especially around pseudo-anonymity, ability to function as an actual currency, and taxability.</p><p> </p><p>Although I don’t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner–let’s call it “USDC” for US Digital Currency–and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency.</p><p>I think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency.</p><p> </p><p>The US government could decide to treat USDC as a second legal currency, which would be hugely powerful.  (I think the US doing this would be significantly more impactful than the smaller governments thinking about it now.)</p><p> </p><p>Ideally the initial coins would be evenly distributed to US citizens and taxpayers—something like everyone with a social security number gets two coins, one that is immediately sellable and one that you have to keep for 10 years.</p><p> </p><p>USDC could require that certain transaction can only happen with wallets with known owners.  It could even build a tax system into the protocol.</p><p> </p><p>A tricky part of this would be how to balance letting the network have control over itself and letting the government have some special degree of input on ‘monetary policy’.  It’s certainly ok for the government to have some, but I think the network needs to be mostly in charge (e.g., the government couldn’t be allowed to arbitrarily inflate the currency when it wanted to).</p><p>The current practices seem to be for governments to mostly ignore cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency enthusiasts to mostly ignore government, which seems to me to be unsustainable in both directions.  But I believe there exists a middle ground where the government can get a lot of what it wants, and cryptocurrency users can get a lot of what they want too.</p><p>The government can likely create a lot of de novo wealth for its citizens in the process.<br></p></div>]]>

    <title>Productivity</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I think I am
at least somewhat more productive than average, and people sometimes ask me for
productivity tips.  So I decided to just write them all down in one place.</p>

<p>Compound
growth gets discussed as a financial concept, but it works in careers as well,
and it is magic.  A small productivity
gain, compounded over 50 years, is worth a lot. 
So it’s worth figuring out how to optimize productivity. If you get 10%
more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded
difference is massive. </p>

<p><b>What you work on</b></p>

<p>It doesn’t
matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction.  Picking the right thing to work on is the
most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more!  Independent thought is hard but it’s
something you can get better at with practice.</p>

<p>The most
impressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in
the general population.  If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever
you last spoke with, that’s bad.  You
will of course be wrong sometimes, but develop the confidence to stick with
your convictions.  It will let you be
courageous when you’re right about something important that most people don’t
see.</p>

<p>I make sure to
leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.  The best
ways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people,
and spending time in nature.</p>

<p>I’ve learned
that I can’t be very productive working on things I don’t care about or don’t
like.  So I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do
them (by delegating, avoiding, or something else).  Stuff that you don’t
like is a painful drag on morale and momentum.</p>

<p>By the way,
here is an important lesson about delegation: remember that everyone else is also
most productive when they’re doing what they like, and do what you’d want other
people to do for you—try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what,
and delegate that way.  </p>

<p>If you find
yourself not liking what you’re doing for a long period of time, seriously
consider a major job change.  Short-term burnout happens, but if it isn’t
resolved with some time off, maybe it’s time to do something you’re more
interested in. </p>

<p>I’ve been very
fortunate to find work I like so much I’d do it for free, which makes it easy
to be really productive.</p>

<p>It’s important
to learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better
quickly.  This feels like an unlikely miracle the first few times it
happens, but eventually you learn to trust that you can do it.</p>

<p>Doing great
work usually requires colleagues of some sort.  Try to be around smart,
productive, happy, and positive people that don’t belittle your ambitions.  I love being around people who push me and
inspire me to be better.  To the degree
you able to, avoid the opposite kind of people—the cost of letting them take up
your mental cycles is horrific. </p>

<p>You have to
both pick the right problem and do the work.  There aren’t many
shortcuts.  If you’re going to do
something really important, you are very likely going to work both smart and
hard.  The biggest prizes are heavily competed for.  This isn’t true in every field (there are
great mathematicians who never spend that many hours a week working) but it is
in most.</p>

<p><b>﻿Prioritization</b><br></p>

<p>My system has
three key pillars: “Make sure to get the important shit done”, “Don’t waste
time on stupid shit”, and “make a lot of lists”.</p>

<p>I highly
recommend using lists.  I make lists of what I want to accomplish each
year, each month, and each day.  Lists are very focusing, and they help me
with multitasking because I don’t have to keep as much in my head.  If I’m not in the mood for some particular
task, I can always find something else I’m excited to do.</p>

<p>I prefer lists
written down on paper.  It’s easy to add
and remove tasks.  I can access them
during meetings without feeling rude.  I
re-transcribe lists frequently, which forces me to think about everything on the
list and gives me an opportunity to add and remove items.</p>

<p>I don’t bother
with categorization or trying to size tasks or anything like that (the most I
do is put a star next to really important items).  </p>

<p>I try to
prioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the
better I feel, and then the more I get done. 
I like to start and end each day with something I can really make
progress on.</p>

<p>I am
relentless about getting my most important projects done—I’ve found that if I
really want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens. </p>

<p>I try to be
ruthless about saying no to stuff, and doing non-critical things in the
quickest way possible.  I probably take this too far—for example, I am
almost sure I am terse to the point of rudeness when replying to emails.</p>

<p>I generally
try to avoid meetings and conferences as I find the time cost to be huge—I get
the most value out of time in my office.  However, it is critical that you
keep enough space in your schedule to allow for chance encounters and exposure
to new people and ideas.  Having an open network is valuable; though
probably 90% of the random meetings I take are a waste of time, the other 10%
really make up for it.</p><p>I find most meetings are best scheduled for 15-20 minutes, or 2 hours.  The default of 1 hour is usually wrong, and leads to a lot of wasted time.</p>

<p>I have
different times of day I try to use for different kinds of work.  The
first few hours of the morning are definitely my most productive time of the
day, so I don’t let anyone schedule anything then.  I try to do meetings
in the afternoon.  I take a break, or
switch tasks, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade. </p>

<p>I don’t think
most people value their time enough—I am surprised by the number of people I
know who make $100 an hour and yet will spend a couple of hours doing something
they don’t want to do to save $20.</p>

<p>Also, don’t
fall into the trap of productivity porn—chasing productivity for its own sake
isn’t helpful.  Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly
optimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they’re working on the
right problems.  It doesn’t matter what system you use or if you squeeze
out every second if you’re working on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>The right goal
is to allocate your year optimally, not your day.</p>

<p><b>Physical factors</b></p>

<p>Very likely
what is optimal for me won’t be optimal for you.  You’ll have to
experiment to find out what works best for your body.  It’s definitely worth doing—it helps in all
aspects of life, and you’ll feel a lot better and happier overall.</p>

<p>It probably
took a little bit of my time every week for a few years to arrive at what works
best for me, but my sense is if I do a good job at all the below I’m at least
1.5x more productive than if not.</p>

<p>Sleep seems to
be the most important physical factor in productivity for me.  Some sort
of sleep tracker to figure out how to sleep best is helpful.  I’ve found the only
thing I’m consistent with are in the set-it-and-forget-it category, and I
really like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0158W3E2A/">Emfit QS+Active</a>.</p>

<p>I like a cold,
dark, quiet room, and a great mattress (I resisted spending a bunch of money on
a great mattress for years, which was stupid—it makes a huge difference to my
sleep quality.  I love <a href="https://www.tempurpedic.com/shop-mattresses/tempur-contour-elite/v/715/">this one</a>).  Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep
helps.  Not drinking alcohol helps a lot, though
I’m not willing to do that all the time.</p>

<p>I use a <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com">Chili
Pad</a> to be cold while I sleep if I can’t get the room cold enough, which is
great but loud (I set it up to have the cooler unit outside my room).</p>

<p>When traveling,
I use an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSO1D9O/">eye mask</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J4HB1C">ear plugs</a>.</p>

<p>This is likely
to be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a
normal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can’t sleep.  I am
a bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel.  It likely has tradeoffs,
but so does not sleeping well.  If you
can already sleep well, I wouldn’t recommend this.</p>

<p>I use a full
spectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on
email.  It’s great—if you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I’d
try.  It’s a ridiculous gain for me.
 I like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075H39NDL/">this one</a>, and it’s easy to travel with.</p>

<p>Exercise is
probably the second most important physical factor.  I tried a number of
different exercise programs for a few months each and the one that seemed best
was lifting heavy weights 3x a week for an hour, and high intensity interval
training occasionally.  In addition to productivity gains, this is also
the exercise program that makes me feel the best overall.  </p>

<p>The third area
is nutrition.  I very rarely eat breakfast, so I get about 15 hours of
fasting most days (except an espresso when I wake up).  I know this is contrary
to most advice, and I suspect it’s not optimal for most people, but it
definitely works well for me.</p>

<p>Eating lots of
sugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to
avoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up
inflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I don’t have much willpower when it comes to
sweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house.</p>

<p>I have one big shot of espresso immediately when I wake up and one after lunch.  I assume this is
about 200mg total of caffeine per day.  I
tried a few other configurations; this was the one that worked by far the best.
 I otherwise aggressively avoid stimulants, but I will have more coffee if
I’m super tired and really need to get something done.</p>

<p>I’m
vegetarian and have been since I was a kid, and I supplement methyl B-12, Omega-3, Iron, and Vitamin D-3.  I
got to this list with a year or so of quarterly blood tests; it’s worked for me
ever since (I re-test maybe every year and a half or so).  There are many
doctors who will happily work with you on a super comprehensive blood test (and
services like <a href="https://www.wellnessfx.com">WellnessFX</a>).  I also go out
of my way to drink a lot of protein shakes, which I hate and I wouldn’t do if I
weren’t vegetarian.</p>

<p><b>﻿Other stuff</b><br></p>

<p>Here’s what I
like in a workspace: natural light, quiet, knowing that I won’t be interrupted
if I don’t want to be, long blocks of time, and being comfortable and relaxed
(I’ve got a beautiful desk with a couple of 4k monitors on it in my office, but
I spend almost all my time on my couch with my laptop).</p>

<p>I wrote custom
software for the annoying things I have to do frequently, which is great.
 I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard
shortcuts that help with my workflow.</p>

<p>Like most
people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no
motivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with
nutrition).  This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient
times.  I have not figured out what to do
about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it
always does.  And I generally try to
avoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice
whether you care about productivity or not.</p>

<p>In general, I
think it’s good to overcommit a little bit.  I find that I generally get
done what I take on, and if I have a little bit too much to do it makes me more
efficient at everything, which is a way to train to avoid distractions (a great
habit to build!).  However, overcommitting a lot is disastrous.</p>

<p>Don’t neglect
your family and friends for the sake of productivity—that’s a very stupid
tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you’ll be less
happy).  Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head
either.</p>

<p>Finally, to
repeat one more time: productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything
at all.  Think more about what to work on.</p></div>]]>

    <title>A Clarification</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I made a point in this <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove">post</a> inelegantly in a way that was
easy to misunderstand, so I’d like to clarify it.<br></p>
















<p></p>

<p>I didn’t mean that we need to tolerate brilliant homophobic
jerks in the lab so that we can have scientific progress. 
Although there are famous counterexamples, most of the best scientists
I’ve met are unusually nice, open-minded people.  Generally I expect that labs that don’t
tolerate jerks will produce more impressive results than the ones that do, and choosing not to employ jerks is a good idea—jerks usually
reduce the net output of organizations.</p>

<p>What I meant is simply that we need, as a society, to
tolerate controversial ideas.  The
biggest new scientific ideas, and the most important changes to society, both start
as extremely unpopular ideas.</p>

<p>It was literally heretical, not so long ago, to say that it
was ok to be gay—the Bible has a different viewpoint.  In a society where we don’t allow challenges
to the orthodoxy, gay rights would not have happened.</p>

<p>We need to allow free speech because sometimes society is
wrong—we needed people to be able to say “gay people are ok” at a time when
“gay people are evil” was the consensus opinion.</p>

<p>It’s probably impossible to design a simple set of rules
that will always allow the right speech and not the wrong speech (although I am
sure that in this particular case, it is wrong that gay people in some places
still fear for their safety.) </p>

<p>So we agree as a society that people are allowed to say
controversial things, and that free speech goes both ways.  Much of the time people use that privilege to
be jerks, and we can, should, and do point out why their bigotry is bad.  Sometimes they use it to say that people
deserve more rights, or that the solar system works in a different way from what the church says—and sometimes we collectively listen. </p>

<p>Over time, this system produces a more and more just world, which says something really good about people as a whole.</p>

<p>I wish we could figure out a way to just never allow hate,
discrimination, and bigotry and always allow debate on controversial but
important ideas.  If that were possible,
I’d support it.  The distinction is
usually clear, but the exceptions are sometimes critically important.  Figuring out exactly where to draw the line is really hard.</p>

<p>Generations before us believed a lot of things we now
believe (correctly, in my opinion) to be unethical or wrong.  Future generations will think a lot of things
we believe today are unethical or wrong. </p>

<p>For example, today it is pretty unpopular to say “anyone who
eats meat is unethical”.  But this is
easily a stance I could imagine being commonplace in 50 years, because of
evolving views on animal rights, impact on the planet, and availability of
lab-grown replacements.  Perhaps even the
arrival of AI makes us think differently about being ok eating other beings
just because they’re much less smart/emotionally sophisticated than we are.</p>

<p>The last time I tried to discuss this with
someone, he said something like: “Banning eating meat would be infringing on my
rights, this is not up for discussion.” </p>

<p>I expect the fact that we let people live in
poverty is also something that future generations will consider an absolute moral failing.  I could go on with a long
list of other ideas, and I’m sure I can’t even think of some of the most
important ones.</p>

<p>The point I most wanted to make is that is that it’s
dangerous to just ban discussion of topics we find offensive, like what
happened <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-gets-list-of-forbidden-words-fetus-transgender-diversity/2017/12/15/f503837a-e1cf-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html?utm_term=.f7f49424f490">yesterday</a>. </p></div>]]>

    <title>E Pur Si Muove</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Earlier
this year, I noticed something in China that really surprised me.  I
realized I felt more comfortable discussing controversial ideas in Beijing than
in San Francisco.  I didn’t feel completely comfortable—this was China,
after all—just more comfortable than at home.</p>

<p>That showed me just how bad things have become, and how much things
have changed since I first got started here in 2005.</p>

<p>It
seems easier to accidentally speak heresies in San Francisco every year.  Debating a controversial idea, even if you
95% agree with the consensus side, seems ill-advised.</p>

<p>This will be very bad for startups in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>Restricting
speech leads to restricting ideas and therefore restricted innovation—the most
successful societies have generally been the most open ones.  Usually mainstream ideas are right and
heterodox ideas are wrong, but the true and unpopular ideas are what drive the
world forward.  Also, smart people tend
to have an allergic reaction to the restriction of ideas, and I’m now seeing
many of the smartest people I know move elsewhere.</p>

<p>It
is bad for all of us when people can’t say that the world is a sphere, that
evolution is real, or that the sun is at the center of the solar system.</p>

<p>More
recently, I’ve seen credible people working on ideas like pharmaceuticals for
intelligence augmentation, genetic engineering, and radical life extension
leave San Francisco because they found the reaction to their work to be so
toxic.  “If people live a lot longer it
will be disastrous for the environment, so people working on this must be
really unethical” was a memorable quote I heard this year.</p>

<p>To
get the really good ideas, we need to tolerate really bad and wacky ideas too.
 In addition to the work Newton is best known for, he also studied alchemy
(the British authorities banned work on this because they feared the
devaluation of gold) and considered himself to be someone specially chosen by
the almighty for the task of decoding Biblical scripture.  </p>

<p>You
can’t tell which seemingly wacky ideas are going to turn out to be right, and
nearly all ideas that turn out to be great breakthroughs start out sounding
like terrible ideas.  So if you want a culture that innovates, you can’t
have a culture where you allow the concept of heresy—if you allow the concept
at all, it tends to spread.  When we move
from strenuous debate about ideas to casting the people behind the ideas as
heretics, we gradually stop debate on all controversial ideas.</p>

<p>This
is uncomfortable, but it’s possible we have to allow people to say disparaging
things about gay people if we want them to be able to say novel things about
physics. [1] Of course we can and should say that ideas are mistaken, but we
can’t just call the person a heretic.  We
need to debate the actual idea. </p>

<p>Political
correctness often comes from a good place—I think we should all be willing to
make accommodations to treat others well.  But too often it ends up being
used as a club for something orthogonal to protecting actual victims.  The best ideas are barely possible to express
at all, and if you’re constantly thinking about how everything you say might be
misinterpreted, you won’t let the best ideas get past the fragment stage.</p>

<p>I
don’t know who Satoshi is, but I’m skeptical that he, she, or they would have
been able to come up with the idea for bitcoin immersed in the current culture of
San Francisco—it would have seemed too crazy and too dangerous, with too many
ways to go wrong.  If SpaceX started in San Francisco in 2017, I assume
they would have been attacked for focusing on problems of the 1%, or for doing
something the government had already decided was too hard.  I can picture
Galileo looking up at the sky and whispering “E pur si muove” here today.</p><p>
<br>Followup: <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/a-clarification">A Clarification</a><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>[1]
I am less worried that letting some people on the internet say things like “gay
people are evil” is going to convince reasonable people that such a
statement is true than I fear losing the opposite—we needed people to be free to say "gay people are ok" to make the progress we've made, even though it was not a generally acceptable thought several decades ago.</p>

<p>In
fact, the only ideas I’m afraid of letting people say are the ones that I think
may be true and that I don’t like.  But I accept that censorship is not
going to make the world be the way I wish it were.</p></div>]]>

    <title>The Merge</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>A popular topic in Silicon Valley is talking about what year humans and machines will merge (or, if not, what year humans will get surpassed by rapidly improving AI or a genetically enhanced species). Most guesses seem to be between 2025 and 2075.<br></p><p>People used to call this the singularity; now it feels uncomfortable and real enough that many seem to avoid naming it at all.</p><p>Perhaps another reason people stopped using the word “singularity” is that it implies a single moment in time, and it now looks like the merge is going to be a gradual process. And gradual processes are hard to notice.</p><p>I believe the merge has already started, and we are a few years in. Our phones control us and tell us what to do when; social media feeds determine how we feel; search engines decide what we think.</p><p>The algorithms that make all this happen are no longer understood by any one person. They optimize for what their creators tell them to optimize for, but in ways that no human could figure out — they are what today seems like sophisticated AI, and tomorrow will seem like child’s play. And they’re extremely effective — at least speaking for myself, I have a very hard time resisting what the algorithms want me to do. Until I made a real effort to combat it, I found myself getting extremely addicted to the internet. [1]</p><p>We are already in the phase of co-evolution — the AIs affect, effect, and infect us, and then we improve the AI. We build more computing power and run the AI on it, and it figures out how to build even better chips.</p><p>This probably cannot be stopped. As we have learned, scientific advancement eventually happens if the laws of physics do not prevent it.</p><p>More important than that, unless we destroy ourselves first, superhuman AI is going to happen, genetic enhancement is going to happen, and brain-machine interfaces are going to happen. It is a failure of human imagination and human arrogance to assume that we will never build things smarter than ourselves.</p><p>Our self-worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing.</p><p>The merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot. But I think a merge is probably our best-case scenario. If two different species both want the same thing and only one can have it—in this case, to be the dominant species on the planet and beyond—they are going to have conflict. We should all want one team where all members care about the well-being of everyone else.</p><p>Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.</p><p>It’s probably going to happen sooner than most people think. Hardware is improving at an exponential rate—the most surprising thing I’ve learned working on OpenAI is just how correlated increasing computing power and AI breakthroughs are—and the number of smart people working on AI is increasing exponentially as well. Double exponential functions get away from you fast.</p><p>It would be good for the entire world to start taking this a lot more seriously now. Worldwide coordination doesn’t happen quickly, and we need it for this.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>[1] I believe attention hacking is going to be the sugar epidemic of this generation. I can feel the changes in my own life — I can still wistfully remember when I had an attention span. My friends’ young children don’t even know that’s something they should miss. I am angry and unhappy more often, but I channel it into productive change less often, instead chasing the dual dopamine hits of likes and outrage.</p><p>(Cross-posted from https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter/merge-now-430c6d89d1fe to here for consistency; thanks to Medium for inviting me to write this!)</p></div>]]>

    <title>American Equity</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I’d like feedback on the following idea.</p><p>I think that every adult US citizen should get an annual share of the US GDP.</p><p>I believe that owning something like a share in America would align all of us in making the country as successful as possible—the better the country does, the better everyone does—and give more people a fair shot at achieving the life they want.  And we all work together to create the system that generates so much prosperity.</p><p>I believe that a new social contract like what I’m suggesting here—where we agree to a floor and no ceiling—would lead to a huge increase in US prosperity and keep us in the global lead.  Countries that concentrate wealth in a small number of families do worse over the long term—if we don’t take a radical step toward a fair, inclusive system, we will not be the leading country in the world for much longer.  This would harm all Americans more than most realize.</p><p>There are historical examples of countries giving out land to citizens (such as the Homestead Acts in the US) as a way to distribute the resources people needed to succeed.  Today, the fundamental input to wealth generation isn’t farmland, but money and ideas—you really do need money to make money.</p><p>American Equity would also cushion the transition from the jobs of today to the jobs of tomorrow.  Automation holds the promise of creating more abundance than we ever dreamed possible, but it’s going to significantly change how we think about work.  If everyone benefits more directly from economic growth, then it will be easier to move faster toward this better world.</p><p>The default case for automation is to concentrate wealth (and therefore power) in a tiny number of hands.  America has repeatedly found ways to challenge this sort of concentration, and we need to do so again.</p><p>The joint-stock company was one of the most important inventions in human history.  It allowed us to align a lot of people in pursuit of a common goal and accomplish things no individual could.  Obviously, the US is not a company, but I think a similar model can work for the US as well as it does for companies.</p><p>A proposal like this obviously requires a lot of new funding [1] to do at large scale, but I think we could start very small—a few hundred dollars per citizen per year—and ramp it up to a long-term target of 10-20% of GDP per year when the GDP per capita doubles.</p><p>I have no delusions about the challenges of such a program.  There would be difficult consequences for things like immigration policy that will need a lot of discussion.  We’d also need to figure out rules about transferability and borrowing against this equity.  And we’d need to set it up in a way that does not exacerbate short-term thinking or favor unsustainable growth.</p><p>However, as the economy grows, we could imagine a world in which every American would have their basic needs guaranteed.  Absolute poverty would be eliminated, and we would no longer motivate people through the fear of not being able to eat.  In addition to being the obviously right thing to do, eliminating poverty will increase productivity.</p><p>American Equity would create a society that I believe would work much better than what we have today.  It would free Americans to work on what they really care about, improve social cohesion, and incentivize everyone to think about ways to grow the whole pie. </p><p> </p><p><br></p><p>[1] It’s time to update our tax system for the way wealth works in the modern world—for example, taxing capital and labor at the same rates.  And we should consider eventually replacing some of our current aid programs, which distort incentives and are needlessly complicated and inefficient, with something like this.</p><p>Of course this won’t solve all our problems—we still need serious reform in areas such as housing, education, and healthcare.  Without policies that address the cost of living crisis, any sort of redistribution will be far less effective than it otherwise could be.</p><div><br></div></div>]]>

      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I'm a strong believer in the importance of the internet in helping people to share knowledge and learn from each other.  So I’m delighted to share, on behalf of YC Continuity, that we’re investing alongside Collaborative Fund in Quora.<br></p><p>Quora is doing extremely well. They now have more than 190 million monthly unique visitors, almost doubling from a year ago. The combination of their ever-improving machine learning and the increasing amount of knowledge shared means the product gets better as it gets bigger. The content I see from Quora constantly gets more personalized for me.</p><p>I also believe they have some of the highest-quality user-generated content on the internet, and a real chance at being one of the few places that contain all human knowledge. The engineering challenges between here and there are great, but if there’s a team and product to bet on, this is one we're backing with confidence.</p><p>Adam is one of the few names that people consistently mention when discussing the smartest CEOs in Silicon Valley. And he has a very long-term focus, which has become a rare commodity in tech companies these days. </p><p>My relationship with Quora goes back to May 2014 when the company participated in YC.  Funding an already successful company was an unusual experiment for us.  At that point we didn't have any specific thoughts on how YC might invest in graduates from our program and help them scale.  In a way, Quora was the inspiration for deciding we needed to figure out how to do that, and we launched YC Continuity in October 2015.</p><p>As an early admirer of Quora and returning investor, I’m thrilled to see the progress they've made and excited to be part of what they do next.</p></div>]]>

    <title>Tech Workers' Values</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>For good and bad, technology has become a central force in all
our lives.</p>

<p>As members of the community, we're interested in ways in which
tech companies can use their collective power to protect privacy, rule of law,
freedom of expression, and other fundamental American rights.  </p>

<p>We’d also like to discuss how tech companies can heal the divide
in our country. We believe that tech companies can create a better economic
future for all Americans by spreading high-paying technology jobs around the
country and other measures. We also
believe tech companies have an opportunity and an obligation to reduce the
polarization we've helped create.</p>

<p>Tech companies are very receptive to their employees'
influence. We believe that employees should come together and clearly
define the values and policies they'd like to see their companies uphold. A tech union isn't the
perfect metaphor for this, but it's not far off.</p>

<p>We are planning to hold a meeting on the evening of April 9th in the Bay Area. Please sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ycombinator.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLkHA3y1TTlyoO-L1I3C_6FX8oRIPKpL0N9xLQmLBmElWXIQ/viewform">here</a> or message us at <u>415 569-2751</u> on Signal if you'd like to come.</p>

<p>We're going try to keep this first group smaller than 50
people so that everyone can actually participate. If more people than that
want to attend, we'll try to select a diverse group of people from a large set
of companies. If this event seems to go well, we expect to host similar
meetings in the future.</p>

</div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Yes -- in fact, the original notion about all this was to be in the same spirit as the 1936 Electrical and Telephone Federal Act which was specifically aimed at rural areas that the utilities didn't want to spend money to reach, so the fed mandated "power and phone" as a kind of universal right. This has also been a theme of the EFF. The basic impulse was also one of the drivers behind Carnegie's huge support of the free library system in the US (the whole story there is interesting, including some of the high minded stipulations in the Carnegie bequests, which I've on occasion tried to get the Internet communities to buy off on).<br>
</div><div><br></div><div>Every Carnegie library had to have two special rooms -- one just for children, and the other <i>where people could be taught to read</i>. Part of the Carnegie money for the libraries supported the reading teachers and sessions. Carnegie was an immigrant and child laborer who could read a little. One of his earliest bosses would open his home library to his workers on Saturdays. Carnegie used this to raise himself up, and never forgot how it happened. (He was also one of the few truly rich people ever who said he was going to give it all away to benefit the civilization around him, and actually did it.)<br>

    <title>Greg</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>A lot of people ask me what the ideal cofounder looks
like.  I now have an answer: Greg Brockman.</p>

<p>Every successful startup I know has at least one person who
provides the force of will to make the startup happen.  I’d thought a lot
about this in the abstract while advising YC startups, but until OpenAI I
hadn’t observed up close someone else drive the formation of a startup.</p>

<p>OpenAI wouldn’t have happened without Greg.  He commits
quickly and fully to things.  I organized a group dinner early on to talk about
what such an organization might look like, and drove him home afterwards. 
Greg asked me questions for the first half of the drive back to San Francisco,
then declared he was in, and started planning logistics for the rest of the
drive.</p>

<p>From then on he was fully in, with an average email response
time of about 5 minutes to anything.  Elon and I were both busy with day
jobs, but Greg kept everything moving forward with imperfect information and a
very high-latency connection.</p>

<p>He recruited the founding team.  Greg is a world-class recruiter
(he plans every detail of interviews, heavily researches candidate’s
backgrounds, sends thoughtful and persistent followups, and so on), and I
now believe even more strongly that someone on the founding team has to be an
amazing recruiter.</p>

<p>He’s incredibly open to feedback.  Large or small, he’s
always willing to hear it, never gets offended, and processes it very
quickly.  I once suggested to him that he wasn't communicating a bold
enough vision for the organization, and the next time I heard him talk
about it (and every time since) it was a perfectly calibrated explanation
of how we were going to succeed at something that really mattered.  Even
on non-traditional ideas, like when I suggested he co-lead the organization with
Ilya, he was always open-minded and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Greg also played the role of ‘non-technical cofounder’, which is
a misnomer because most people who know him will say something like “Greg is
the most productive engineer I know”.  But he took on all the
non-technical roles at the beginning, defining the culture, making offers,
organizing offsites, letting everyone work out of his apartment, ordering
supplies, cleaning up after meals, etc.  It's important to have someone
great in this role at a small startup—many people gloss over it.</p>

<p>Without someone dedicated to finding a solution to all problems,
no matter how difficult, eventually a large problem will come along and kill you while you’re
still weak.  Founding teams need a Chief
Optimist to rally everyone to press on despite the difficulties, and it’s always hard on that
person because they can’t really lean on anyone else in the hardest times.</p>

<p>You for sure need great technical talent on a founding team, but
make sure you also have someone like Greg.  If they’re the same person,
then you’ve hit the jackpot.</p></div>]]>

    <title>What I Heard From Trump Supporters</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>After the election, I decided to talk to 100 Trump voters from around
the country.  I went to the middle of the
country, the middle of the state, and talked to many online.</p>

<p>This was a surprisingly interesting and helpful experience—I highly
recommend it.  With three exceptions, I
found something to like about everyone I talked to (though I strongly disagreed with many of the things
they said). 
Although it shouldn’t have surprised me given the voting data, I was
definitely surprised by the diversity of the people I spoke to—I did not expect
to talk to so many Muslims, Mexicans, Black people, and women in the course of
this project.</p>

<p>Almost everyone I asked was willing to talk to me, but almost none of
them wanted me to use their names—even people from very red states were worried
about getting “targeted by those people in Silicon Valley if they knew I voted
for him”.  One person in Silicon Valley
even asked me to sign a confidentiality agreement before she would talk to me,
as she worried she’d lose her job if people at her company knew she was a
strong Trump supporter. </p>

<p>I wanted to understand what Trump voters liked and didn’t like about
the president, what they were nervous about, what they thought about the left’s
response so far, and most importantly, what would convince them not to vote for
him in the future. </p>

<p>Obviously, this is not a poll, and not ‘data’.  But I think narratives are really important.</p>

<p>Here’s what I heard.</p>

<p>The TL;DR quote is this: </p>

<p>“You all can defeat Trump next time, but not if you keep mocking us,
refusing to listen to us, and cutting us out. 
It’s Republicans, not Democrats, who will take Trump down.”</p><p> </p>

<p><b>What do you
like about Trump?</b></p>

<p>“He is not
politically correct.” <i>Note: This sentiment came up a lot, probably in
at least a third of the conversations I had.</i></p>

<p>“He says true but
unpopular things.  If you can’t talk
about problems, you can’t fix them.”</p><p><b>
“</b>I'm a Jewish
libertarian who's [<i>sic</i>] grandparents
were Holocaust survivors.  Over the last
few years the mainstream left has resorted to name-calling and character
assassination, instead of debate, any time their positions are questioned.  This atmosphere became extremely oppressive
and threatening to people, like myself, who disagreed with many of Obama's
policies over the past several years.  Intelligent
debate has become rare.”</p>

<p>“It's a lot like
political discussion was in Soviet Union, actually.  I think the inability to acknowledge obvious
truths, and the ever-increasing scope of these restrictions makes it
particularly frustrating.  And
personally, for whatever reason, I find inability to have more subtle
discussion very frustrating--things are not white or black, but you can't talk
about greys since the politically correct answer is white.”</p>

<p>“He is anti-abortion.” <i>Note: This
sentiment came up a lot.  A number of
people I spoke to said they didn’t care about anything else he did and would
always vote for whichever candidate was more anti-abortion.</i></p><p>“I like that he puts the
interests of Americans first.  American
policy needs to be made from a position of how Americans benefit from it, as
that is the role of government.”</p>

<p>“He is anti-immigration.” <i>Note: This
sentiment came up a lot.  The most
surprising takeaway for me how little it seemed to be driven by economic
concerns, and how much it was driven by fears about “losing our culture”,
“safety”, “community”, and a general Us-vs.-Them mentality.</i><i> </i></p><p>“He will preserve
our culture.  Preservation of culture is
considered good in most cases.  What’s
wrong with preserving the good parts of American culture?”</p>

<p>“He’s not Hillary Clinton.”</p>

<p>“I’m Mexican.  I support the wall.  The people who have stayed have destroyed
Mexico, and now they want to get out and cause damage here.  We need to protect our borders, but now any
policy is like that is called racist. 
Trump was the first person willing to say that out loud.”</p>

<p>“I am socially very
liberal.  I am fiscally very
conservative.  I don't feel I have a
party--never have.  I grew up in a more
socially conservative time and picked the "lesser of two evils"
during elections.  Now, the more socially
liberal side supports bigger governments, more aid and support and that money
has to come from somewhere.  I see
what's deducted from my check each week. 
I'm OK with never being rich but I'd like more security and that
doesn't come from more government spending.”</p>

<p>“We need borders at every
level of our society.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to postpone some further social justice progress, which
doesn’t really result in loss of life, in favor of less foreign policy
involvement, the opposite of which does." </p>

<p>“Brown people are
always the out-crowd.  I think
subconsciously, part of the reason I supported him was a way to be in the
in-crowd for once.”</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><b>What don’t
you like about him?</b><b> </b></p>

<p>“The way he talks about women is despicable.”</p>

<p>“Everything about his style.  We
only voted for him because this election was too important to worry about
style.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like most things about him. 
The way it worked is we got to choose one of two terrible options.”</p>

<p>“I think our
nation needs Trumpism to survive long term, and to me that supersedes almost
every other reservation I have.  My issue
is with Trump himself--I think he's the wrong vessel for his movement, but he's
all we've got so I'm behind him.” </p>

<p>“I think the
rollout of the immigration executive order is emblematic of a clusterfuck, to
be completely frank.”</p>

<p>“I now believe the
Muslim ban actually makes us less safe.”</p>

<p>“Isolationism and
protectionism at this point is insane. We've done that before.”</p>

<p>“I, too, worry about the
dishonesty.  His relationship with
Russia, his relationship with women.  His
relationship with questionable financial matters.  These all worry me and were they to continue
I would lose all respect.”</p>

<p>“He continually plays into a character that he has created
to rile his fan base. Accepting anti-semitism, white nationalism, or hate
emanating unnecessarily, creates a vacuum of fear on social media, on
television, and around the dinner table. 
Even though the policies may be similar to that of any recent Republican
President, the behavior to act so immaturely sets a bad example for children
and undercuts many cultural norms, which more than anything causes disruption
to our sociological foundations.”</p>

<p>“I hate that he discredits
the press all the time.  That seems to
forebode great evil.”</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><b>What are
you nervous about with Trump as president?</b></p>

<p>“The thing I’m most worried about is war, and that he could destroy
the whole world.  I think I may have
underestimated that risk, because he is more of an alpha strongman that I
realized when I voted for him.  Otherwise
I still like him.” <i>Note: Most
people weren’t that worried about war. 
More frequent comments were along these lines: </i></p><p>
“I know he’s taking strong positions on certain foreign issues, but I feel in
negotiations you need to do things to move the needle and when a whole country
is watching its hard to keep a poker face, but at least his business track
record overall gives us reason to believe ultimately stability will prevail.”</p>

<p><i>and</i></p>

<p>“He’s crazy, but
it’s a tactic to get other nations not to mess with us.”</p>

<p>“I worry he will drive us apart as a nation.  I believed him when he said that would stop
with the campaign, but I haven’t seen signs of it so far.”</p>

<p>“I am nervous that his mental health is actually bad.”</p>

<p>“I worry he is actually going to roll back social change we’ve fought
so hard for.  But I hope not.”</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><b>What do you
think about the left’s response so far?</b><b> </b></p>

<p>“You need to give us an opportunity to admit we may have been wrong
without saying we’re bad people.  I am
already thinking I made a mistake, but I feel ostracized from my community.” </p>

<p>“The left is more intolerant than the right.”  <i>Note: This
concept came up a lot, with real animosity in otherwise pleasant conversations.</i></p>

<p>“Stop calling us racists.  Stop
calling us idiots.  We aren’t.  Listen to us when we try to tell you why we
aren’t.  Oh, and stop making fun of us.” </p>

<p>“I’d love to see one-tenth of the outrage about the state of our lives
out here that you have for Muslims from another country.   You have no idea what our lives are like.”</p>

<p>“I’m so tired of hearing about white privilege.  I’m white, but way less privileged than a
black person from your world.  I have no
hope my life will ever get any better.”</p>

<p><b>“</b>I am tired
of feeling silenced and demonized.  We
have mostly the same goals, and different opinions about how to get there.  Maybe I’m wrong, maybe you’re wrong.  But enough with calling all of us the devil
for wanting to try Trump.  I hate Hillary
and think she wants to destroy the country of us but I don’t demonize her
supporters.” </p>

<p>“I’m angry that they’re so outraged now, but were never outraged over
an existing terrible system.”</p>

<p>“The attacks against Trump
have taught me something about myself. I have defended him and said things I
really didn't believe or support because I was put in a defensive position.
Protesters may have pushed many people in this direction BUT it is ultimately
our responsibility and must stop.”</p>

<p>“I'd like to also add that the demonization of
Trump by calling him and his supporters: Nazis, KKK, white supremacists,
fascists, etc. works very well in entrenching Trump supporters on his side.  These attacks are counter-factual and in my
opinion very helpful to Trump.” </p>

<p>“So far his election has
driven our nation apart.  So far I see
most of the divisiveness coming from the left. 
Shame on them.  I don't see it
quite as bad as during Nixon's era but we are truly headed in that
direction.  I could not speak with my
parents during that time because political division would intrude.  This Thanksgiving and holiday season were as
close as I've felt to that in 40 years. 
We are increasingly polarized.  It
doesn't seem to be strictly generational, though that exists.  There is an east coast-west coast, rural vs.
urban, racial, and gender division forming now. 
It has the potential to be devastating.”<b> </b></p>

<p>“The
amount of violent attacks and economic attacks perpetrated by the left
are troublesome.  My wife and I
recently moved to the Bay Area.  I
was expecting a place which was a welcoming meritocracy of ideas.  Instead, I found a place where everyone
constantly watches everyone else for any thoughtcrime.” </p>

<p>“Silicon Valley is
incredibly unwelcoming to alternative points of view.  Your curiosity, if it is sincere, is the very
rare exception to the rule.”</p>

<p>“There is something
hypocritical about the left saying the are uniters not dividers, they are
inclusive and then excluding half the population with comments on intelligence
and irrelevance in the modern world.”</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><b>What would
convince you not to vote for him again?</b></p>

<p>“War would be unforgivable.”</p>

<p>“If the Russia thing were true, I’d turn against him.  Why don’t y’all focus on that instead of his
tweets?”</p>

<p>“Give us a better option, and we’ll be happy.  But it needs to be a moderate—Sanders won’t
win.”</p>

<p>“I’ll happily vote for someone else. 
There’s a lot I hate about Trump. 
But our lives are basically destroyed, and he was the first person to
talk about fixing that.”</p>

<p>“Generally hard to say.  Extreme
corruption would do it.”</p>

<p><i>Second
person in the same conversation: </i>“I don’t care if he’s corrupt.  Y’all voted for Hillary and she was the most
corrupt candidate of all time.”</p>

<p>“Another worry is
an escalation of overreaches between him and the left that culminates in the
breakdown of our system of law.  I'd hold
him responsible for that.”</p>

<p>“If he were to get
the US involved in a major military conflict (I think the odds of this have
actually decreased versus Hillary, but I'm willing to be proven wrong). If he
were to substantially increase the cost of doing business (by increasing
regulation or taxes for instance).”</p>

<p>“I'm socially very
liberal. If he were to do something like restart a war on drugs, try to
restrict rights of LGBT, or make first trimester abortions difficult or
dangerous, I'd rethink my position.  I
think these type of things are extremely unlikely though, especially with an
election a few years away the country as a whole becoming more socially
liberal.”</p>

<p>“I think if 2008
happened again (further into Trump's tenure, so that causation can be shown,
hypothetically), the base would evaporate.” </p>

<p>“Based on Trump's
history before politics I don't believe he is racist, sexist, homophobic or
bigoted.  If that were true it would
supersede everything else since it would be even worse for individual liberty
and freedom than any freedom of speech restrictions or increases in government
size proposed by the Democratic Party.”</p></div>]]>

    <title>2017 YC Annual Letter</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Dear YC Community:</p><p>In response to a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13203833" target="_blank">comment</a> on Hacker News, I’m going to try writing an annual letter to the YC community with an update on our progress.</p><p>Our mission is to enable the most innovation of any company in the world in order to make the future great for everyone.  We believe new technology, economic growth, and new ideas about how our society might function are more important than ever before.</p><p>As of January 1, 2017, YC has funded over 3,200 founders and 1,470 companies.  This year, assuming there is not a macroeconomic meltdown, we expect the total valuation of companies that have gone through our program to surpass $100 billion.  We have also funded more than 30 non-profits.</p><p>As always, most of the credit goes to our founders—they, and the astonishingly strong and helpful community they create, are what make YC special.  The second-most credit goes to our team—I am incredibly thankful to work with such a talented and driven group of people.</p><p><b>YC Companies &amp; Investments</b></p><p>We invested about $27 million in the Winter and Summer 2016 batches, and so far we have invested about $187 million in later-stage investments from our first Continuity fund.</p><p>We are excited to fund companies in any space that we believe is good for the world and can eventually sustain a very large company.  Some of the many areas we’re interested in are noted in our <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/rfs-news-jobs-and-democracy/" target="_blank">Requests for Startups</a>.</p><p>Our largest exit of 2016 was <a href="https://www.getcruise.com/" target="_blank">Cruise</a>, a self-driving car company.  We expect to fund many more machine learning-driven companies in the future (I will generally avoid calling out trends in these letters, because I’ve noticed doing that produced unintended consequences, but this one is so obvious and so important that I’m happy to mention it).</p><p><a href="http://www.helionenergy.com/" target="_blank">Helion</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/okloinc/" target="_blank">Oklo</a>, and <a href="https://www.thinkbright.mx/" target="_blank">Bright</a> are all working toward inexpensive clean energy, an area of great interest to us.  <a href="https://www.lendup.com/" target="_blank">LendUp</a> and <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a> are two examples of YC companies innovating in financial services technology.  <a href="http://boomsupersonic.com/" target="_blank">Boom</a> and <a href="http://relativityspace.com/" target="_blank">Relativity Space</a> are pursuing strategies in aerospace that most companies haven’t pursued seriously in a long time, or ever.<br></p><p><a href="http://www.ginkgobioworks.com/" target="_blank">Gingko Bioworks</a> is learning how to design new organisms, and <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/" target="_blank">Science Exchange</a> is making it easier to get new experiments done.  <a href="https://farmlogs.com/" target="_blank">FarmLogs</a> is making it easier and more efficient to grow food, and <a href="https://www.gobble.com/" target="_blank">Gobble</a>, <a href="https://www.instacart.com/" target="_blank">Instacart</a> and <a href="https://www.doordash.com/" target="_blank">Doordash</a> are making it easier to eat it.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://9gag.com/" target="_blank">9Gag</a> continue to make me waste enormous amounts of time, but I love every minute I waste.  </p><p><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>, <a href="https://www.plangrid.com/" target="_blank">PlanGrid</a>, <a href="https://checkr.com/" target="_blank">Checkr</a>, <a href="https://www.flexport.com/" target="_blank">Flexport</a>, <a href="https://gusto.com/" target="_blank">Gusto</a> are just a few of the enterprise companies we’ve seen begin to thrive.  <a href="https://www.mz.com/" target="_blank">Machine Zone</a> has become one of the largest gaming companies in the world.  <a href="https://www.rappi.com/" target="_blank">Rappi</a>, <a href="http://www.wave.com/" target="_blank">Wave</a>, and <a href="https://www.strikingly.com/" target="_blank">Strikingly</a> are some of the many YC companies succeeding on other continents.</p><p>In addition to the three companies we are currently best known for—Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe—more than 50 of our companies are worth more than $100 million each.</p><p>We’ve funded <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/companies/" target="_blank">a lot of other companies</a>, but in the spirit of not exhausting your patience, I’ll stop listing them here.</p><p><b>Hyperscale</b></p><p>There’s one more trend I want to mention, though it’s not about a specific market.  I think we’re now in the era of hyperscale technology companies.  If you believe Metcalfe’s law, it stands to reason that network-effected technology companies are now far more powerful than ever before, simply because the number of people connected to the internet keeps getting bigger, and n^2 gets big really fast.</p><p>Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft have powerful advantages that are still not fully understood by most founders and investors.  I expect that they will continue to do a lot of things well, have significant data and computation advantages, be able to attract a large percentage of the most talented engineers, and aggressively buy companies that get off to promising starts.  This trend is unlikely to reverse without antitrust action, and I suggest people carefully consider its implications for startups.  There will of course be areas where these companies are naturally weaker, and these are good areas to start companies.</p><p><b>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</b></p><p>In 2016, we funded 68 female founders at 52 companies. About 22.3% of the companies we funded had a woman on the founding team, and about 12.5% of the founders we funded were women.  In 2016, we funded 52 Black and Latino founders at 29 companies.  11.6% of the founders we funded were Black or Latino.</p><p>The percentage of women who apply to YC is roughly the same as the percentage of women who get funded.  The same is true for Black and Latino founders.</p><p>From the data we have available, it seems that the percentage of women and people of color applying to YC is higher than the overall percentage of women and people of color starting startups.  This is encouraging, but we continue to want to understand and address the barriers that prevent more founders from underrepresented groups from starting startups and applying to YC.  We still have a long way to go.</p><p>While we remain committed to helping more underrepresented founders get started, we believe that’s only part of the solution.  We still see significant dropoffs at the stages after YC (e.g. raising late-stage capital).  The larger startup community needs to consider how little the unicorn-founder demographics resemble the early-stage demographics.</p><p>There’s clearly a lot more work to do here, and we’re committed to help do it.  We’re hosting our fourth annual Female Founders Conference this year in June, continuing our Open Office Hours with underrepresented communities and bringing in unconscious bias experts to train our team.  We’re always open to hearing how we can do a better job, so if you’ve come across practices or programs that work well to support diverse founders, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/contact/" target="_blank">please let us know</a>.</p><p><b>YC Organization</b></p><p>Y Combinator is currently made up of 5 groups.  I’ll talk a little about each of them here.  We expect to add several more over the next few years, and in general you should expect us to try a lot of stuff (though of course not all of it will work).  You should also expect us to continue to grow the number of companies we fund.</p><p><b>YC (our flagship program)</b></p><p>In October of 2016, <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/author/michael-seibel/" target="_blank">Michael Seibel</a> took over responsibility for our main program as CEO of YC.  He’s doing an outstanding job, and I expect the program to significantly strengthen over the course of 2017 and beyond.</p><p>In 2016 (and the first part of 2017), we added three remarkable partners to the flagship group: Tim Brady, Adora Cheung and Daniel Gross.</p><p>One of my partners that I’d like to especially thank is Dalton Caldwell.  Dalton has been a YC partner since 2013, and now runs our admissions team, which is perhaps the most important function we have.  Dalton has taken a process that used to be stressful and deeply imperfect and improved it by a huge amount.  Though I’m sure we’ll still make mistakes, I sleep better at night thinking that we’re making far fewer in this area than we used to.</p><p>While I’m on the topic of recognizing partners, I’d also like to thank the three partners at YC that get some of the least public recognition.  Kirsty Nathoo is our CFO, and Jon and Carolynn Levy are our General Counsels.  They are full partners at YC but since they don’t advise our companies (as much) on business as the other partners, they are less well-known.  However, they work incredibly hard and thoughtfully, and they are one of the secrets to our success.  In fact, one of our most successful founders recently said to me “I tell every startup I meet they should do YC, and the reason is Jon Levy.  I don’t get how he managed to take my calls at all hours of the day, because the other founders in my batch said he did the same for them, but he solved more problems for us than I can count, and also just listened to me when I had a bad day.”</p><p>Finally, I’d like to thank our entire software team, lead by my partner Jared Friedman.  We’ve had an incredible improvement in our software over the past year, and someday when the history of YC is written, I expect that people will talk about software as one of our secret weapons.  This shouldn’t be so secret—one might reasonably expect technology investors to understand the importance of great software for themselves—but it is generally not the case.</p><p>We give companies in this program $120k for 7% ownership in their company, and work with them intensively for 3 months and then less intensively for the rest of the company’s life.  We run this program twice a year, and currently fund about 125 companies per batch. While at YC, founders get access to a range of resources, advice, connections, and special deals.</p><p>Anyone can <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/" target="_blank">apply</a> on our website, and all sorts of people do (here are some <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/common-misconceptions-about-applying-to-yc/" target="_blank">common misconceptions</a> about who YC accepts).</p><p>Companies often ask us how we decide who gets into YC.  There are four questions I consider:</p><p>1) Will this company build something lots of people really love?</p><p><i>If so, and if ‘lots’ is sufficiently large, the company has the chance to produce substantial earnings.</i></p><p>2) Will this company be easy to copy?</p><p><i>The most successful companies I’ve worked with have a significant competitive advantage—network effect, proprietary technology, complex coordination, or barrier to entry of some other sort.  I understand in theory it’s possible to build a very successful commodity company, but I don’t know how to do it.</i></p><p>3) Will these founders develop into “forces of nature”?</p><p><i>As most people say, it’s hard to make money unless you invest in great founders.  Defining what that means is usually left as an exercise to the reader.  Here are some questions I ask myself: Are these founders relentlessly determined?  Are they original thinkers?  Are they smart, and especially do they have new insights I haven’t heard before?  Are they good communicators (and so will they be able to hire, sell, raise money, talk to the press, etc)?  Are they focused and intense?  Do they always seem to find a way around obstacles?  Would I work for them?</i></p><p><i>This is the often the hardest factor for me to evaluate, because you have to make a judgment about trajectory—you are trying to predict where someone will be in five years.</i></p><p>4) Does this company have a clear and important mission?</p><p><i>Without this, I usually get bored.  More importantly, companies that don’t have this usually have a hard time recruiting enough great people to work with them, and thus struggle to become very large.</i></p><p>We especially like founders who have some sort of non-traditional background; we are somewhat suspicious of founders with extremely “tracked” lives.  Startups are not a resume item, and we don’t like founders who view YC as a stop on the way to B-school.  Although in many ways it’s a good problem to have, the increase in the value of YC’s brand means we have to work harder to find people doing a startup for the right reason: to bring an idea they’re obsessed with to life, and willing to do something unreasonable to see it happen.</p><p>We have had great success funding “unknown” people, and we will keep doing this—it’s one of our two or three best secrets.  Please help us spread the message: you don’t need to be experienced, well-known, or have an impressive resume to get into YC.  We fund smart, ambitious people with a great idea and evidence that they can build things.</p><p>If you know a founder who should apply to YC, <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/recommend/" target="_blank">you can recommend them to us</a>. That said, companies don’t need a recommendation or introduction, and most companies we fund don’t have one.</p><p>As I mentioned before, I think the strength and quality of our community is one of the most important things we have to offer.  As with any community, this emerges from a complex set of factors, but I’ll mention three here.</p><p>One of the most important cultural values PG and Jessica put in place was to do the right thing for founders, even when it is not in our own short-term interest.  When I was going through YC, it was the thing that most stuck out to me as different from other investors.</p><p>Another cultural value they created is to try to fund only good people (in the sense of doing the right thing, though separately we evaluate for effectiveness).  We sometimes get this very wrong, and dealing with the repercussions is the most unpleasant part of our job.  However, we manage to get it right a lot.</p><p>Thirdly, we have a ‘pay-it-forward’ mentality.  Startups in the batch know they can ask any alumni for help, well beyond normal Silicon Valley expectations.  Later, when they’re successful alumni, they help new companies without us ever asking.<br></p><p><b>YC Continuity</b></p><p>YC Continuity is our growth-stage fund.  We started it in 2015, and it’s run by Ali Rowghani.  Last year, Anu Hariharan joined as our second YC Continuity partner.</p><p>We do this to provide a source of friendly growth-stage capital to companies and founders that go through the YC program, especially to companies that other investors may not fully understand.  We also hope to be a force for good in the growth-stage investing market.</p><p>YC Continuity will begin to experiment with programs to provide more advice and resources to growth-stage companies in 2017.</p><p><b>YC Research</b></p><p>YC Research is a non-profit research division of YC.  Although we think startups are a good structure to align people to solve a problem, they are clearly not the best solution for everything.  For some important problems, a non-profit research lab is a good approach.</p><p>We sometimes fund and run internal groups, and sometimes fund external organizations.</p><p>So far there are 5 groups: <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/basic-income/" target="_blank">Basic Income</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://harc.ycr.org/" target="_blank">HARC</a>, <a href="https://cities.ycr.org/" target="_blank">New Cities</a>, and <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-research-universal-healthcare/" target="_blank">Universal Healthcare</a>.</p><p>Basic Income is studying the effects of giving people unconditional monthly cash.  We are currently in our pilot phase in Oakland.  We are continuing to learn and make changes, and work with various public agencies and governments to enable the full-scale study.  We are planning to run a larger study than we originally intended, and we hope to start fundraising for it soon.</p><p>OpenAI is trying to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity.  In our first year, we released Gym, Universe, and a number of new ideas that were at the limits of my understanding but that I enjoyed reading about.  In 2017, we hope to achieve significant new milestones that are not possible with current AI technology.</p><p>HARC is a group headed by Alan Kay inventing new ways for humans to learn and understand more.  My visit to <a href="https://harc.ycr.org/project/realtalk/" target="_blank">Bret Victor’s lab</a> last year, which is a sort of computerized interactive room, remains one of the new technologies I think most about.</p><p>New Cities is still in the exploration phase, but we hope to have more to share over the course of this year.</p><p>Universal Healthcare is a project on which we are partnering with Watsi to study how we can use technology to make healthcare both better and more affordable.</p><p>We grew a little faster than we were expecting, so we are trying to take a breather on further growth at YCR.  But we may still add one more group in 2017.</p><p><b>Startup School</b></p><p>Startup School is our new MOOC (which we will supplement with our existing series of conferences).  It will be open to anyone (unless we get absolutely overwhelmed with interest) and is free.  We will stream talks like the ones that happen during YC dinners, provide advice to startups, and help them connect to other startups in the program and other people that may be helpful.</p><p>Although we clearly stand to gain from this, we are doing it because we believe spreading the message about entrepreneurship and making the necessary information, community, and connections freely accessible to everyone who might want to start a company is important.</p><p>This year, I’ll be teaching it.</p><p>If this goes well, we hope to offer it every year.  In future years, we also hope to explore how something like ‘financial aid’ might work for people that need a small amount of capital to help get their startup going.</p><p><b>Hacker News</b></p><p>Hacker News (HN) is an internet forum, created by Paul Graham shortly after YC got started and now run by Daniel Gackle.  Its original purpose was to try out the programming language PG was developing—a dialect of Lisp called Arc, that HN still proudly uses today—and to be a place to find interesting things to read.</p><p>HN’s initial users were fans of the essays PG had been publishing about startups, programming, and a lot of other things.  Soon it became a hub for everyone interested in YC and startups YC was funding.  YC and HN grew up together, and many YC founders started as HN users.</p><p>HN remains focused on startups, programming, and lots of other things—anything intellectually interesting goes.  The HN community has developed many unique features over the years, such as the "Show HN" format, where users share something they've made, and monthly "Who Is Hiring" threads that have helped many community members find jobs.</p><p>Hacker News has 3.4 million users per month and 350,000 users per day, with 4 million pageviews a day.  There are just under 1 million registered accounts, with several hundred added each day.  Users post around 1,000 articles and 6,000 comments to the site per day.</p><p>These numbers are all growing, but relatively slowly, and we like it that way.  Internet forums are notorious for degrading over time--one of the ways PG described HN was as an experiment in seeing how long a forum could stay good before it deteriorated.  We've mostly managed to stave that off, for 10 years now, but we're always mindful of this risk.</p><p>HN has grown into the leading community for tech and startups on the internet, known for its emphasis on civil, substantive discussion—at least in theory!  Our team affectionately refers to HN as "the worst internet forum, except for all the others".</p><p><br></p><p>-----</p><p><br></p><p>We are only about 30 years into the age of software, about 20 years into the age of the internet, and about 2 years into the age of artificial intelligence.  Each of these by themselves is a technology revolution that I believe we will look back on as being extremely significant; taken together, I believe they will represent the most significant technology revolution in human history—I believe we are likely to have less in common with whatever we call the most intelligent species on the planet in 600 years than we did with humans 60,000 years ago.</p><p>It’s an exciting time to do what we do.</p><div><br></div><div><br></div><p>Sam Altman</p><p>President, YC Group</p></div>]]>

    <title>Time to Take a Stand</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>It is time for tech companies to start speaking up about
some of the actions taken by President Trump’s administration.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.track-trump.com">many actions</a> from his first week that are
objectionable.  In repeatedly
invoking unsubstantiated conspiracy theories (like the 3 million illegal
votes), he's delegitimizing his opponents and continuing to damage our
society.  So much objectionable
action makes it hard to know where and when to focus, and outrage fatigue is an
effective strategy.</p>

<p>But the executive order from yesterday titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry
Into the United States” is tantamount to a Muslim ban and requires objection.  I am obviously in favor of safety and rules, but
broad-strokes actions targeted at a specific religious group is the wrong solution,
and a first step toward a further reduction in rights.</p>

<p>In addition, the precedent of invalidating already-issued visas
and green cards should be extremely troubling for immigrants of any country or
for anyone who thinks their contributions to the US are important.  This is not just a Muslim ban.  This is a breach of America's contract with all
the immigrants in the nation.</p>

<p>This administration has already
shown that they are not particularly impressed by the first amendment, and that
they are interested in other anti-immigrant action.  So we must object, or our inaction will send
a message that the administration can continue to take away our rights.  </p>

<p>In doing so, we should not
demonize Trump voters—most of them voted for him for reasons other than the
promise of a Muslim ban.  We need their
eventual support in resisting actions like these, and we will not get it if we
further isolate them.<b> </b></p>

<p>The tech community is
powerful.  Large tech companies in particular
have enormous power and are held in high regard.  We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and
unequivocally.  Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers—if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.</p>
















<p>Tech companies go to extraordinary
lengths to recruit and retain employees; those employees have a lot of
leverage.  If employees push companies to do something, I believe they’ll have to.  </p>

<p>At a minimum, companies should
take a public stance.  But talking is
only somewhat effective, and employees should push their companies to figure
out what actions they can take.  I wish I
had better ideas here, but we’re going to have a meeting on Friday at Y
Combinator to discuss.  I’d love to see
other tech companies do the same. </p>

<p>If this action has not crossed a
line for you, I suggest you think now about what your own line in the sand
is.  It’s easy, with gradual escalation,
for the definition of ‘acceptable’ to get moved.  So think now about what action President
Trump might take that you would consider crossing a line, and write it down.  </p>

<p>Almost every member of the GOP I have spoken to knows that these
actions are wrong.  Paul Ryan, Mike
Pence, Kevin McCarthy and James Mattis said so themselves when Trump first
proposed his Muslim ban.  We need to
remind anyone involved in this administration that, for the rest of their
lives, they will have to explain why they were complicit in this. </p>

<p>In my f<a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/trump">irst post on Trump</a> last June,
I said it would be a good time for all of us to start speaking up.  We are
now at the stage where something is starting that is going to be taught in
history classes, and not in a good way.  This morning, Kellyanne Conway
posted on Twitter that Trump is "a man of action" who is "just
getting started".  I believe her.  We must now start speaking
up.</p></div>]]>

    <title>Affordable Care</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>The Affordable Care Act is far from perfect–for one thing, I think health insurance should be entirely separate from employment–but I hate the thought of losing it without a replacement for people who will lose insurance. If Congress ends up repealing it, I hope they earnestly try to preserve the best parts, and put in place something better.</p><p>One thing the ACA definitely did was help a lot of founders start their companies--without it, being a founder would make sense for less people. <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/blog/2016/01/12/one-in-five-2014-marketplace-consumers-was-a-small-business-owner-or-self-employed.html" title="Link: https://www.hhs.gov/blog/2016/01/12/one-in-five-2014-marketplace-consumers-was-a-small-business-owner-or-self-employed.html">The Department of Health and Human Services released a lot of new data yesterday showing how the ACA helped support entrepreneurs</a>, and in light of that, I thought it would be good to collect and share stories of how the ACA helped some Y Combinator founders get started.</p><p>Here they are in the founders’ own words:</p><p><img width="1" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/b49FlLPrPoXxm4XtQ-tmmprPwcfKMvYLkiHH5N9KSW6xQ62HI6oqOqlfuWkJuOaYyW5TjoxqZQY44rTYsnzIUeWHSDoYezeEJsDd9uVZoRM4qjOX4ESNX6qTN1cje41LPP1lhRkO" height="1"></p><p>Dan Carroll, <a href="https://clever.com/">Clever</a>, S12</p><p>March 3, 2012: I'm holed up in a hotel room in San Francisco with two of my best friends, wildly excited about the idea that will become Clever. We've packed the day with difficult conversations – Where will the company be founded? Do we have enough savings? Who will be CEO? – but the only topic that I'm truly afraid of is health. I've been living with Crohn's Disease for nearly ten years, and I know that without health care, I'd die, and without health insurance, I'd go broke. But some quick research tells me that, thanks to the ACA, I can join my parents' healthcare plan until I turn 26 the following January. Risk mitigated, I make the commitment to my cofounders - I'm in.</p><br><p>Ethan Perlstein, <a href="https://www.perlara.com/">Perlara</a>, W16</p><p>I left academia on Jan 1, 2013 as unemployed former postdoc. I would not have been able to move across the country to start my company, and my wife wouldn't have given up her employer-sponsored health insurance, if not for Obamacare. Also, some of the first employees at Perlara depended on the ACA for insurance.</p><br><p>Randall Bennett, <a href="https://www.vidpresso.com/">VidPresso</a>, W14 </p><p>There's a good chance that without the aca my startup wouldn't exist... or I'd be dead. When launching my startup we couldn't get health insurance because one insurer denied us because I once had a sleep study for sleep apnea. Once you get one rejection, all the others reject you.</p><p>Then, last year I had a brain tumor. I had moved off to a more normal health plan... but with the last set of rules chances are it'd have been unlikely I could have gotten any insurance, let alone a somewhat reasonable plan. </p><br><p>Ben Maitland-Lewis, <a href="https://www.prettyinstant.com/">Pretty Instant</a>, W15</p><p>We aren't yet at a stage where we can offer healthcare to our employees but thanks to the ACA we are all individually insured. This has been instrumental in helping us grow the business while keeping costs low. I hope the next administration doesn't repeal our access to individualized affordable healthcare as it would have a direct effect on the company at this stage.</p><br><p>Ravi Parikh, <a href="https://heapanalytics.com/">Heap</a>, W13</p><p>The provision in ACA that allows young adults to remain on their parents' health insurance until they're 26 has helped me multiple times. In 2011, I was self-employed as a musician, which would have been much more difficult to pursue if I weren't able to take advantage of my parents' health insurance. Later, my co-founder Matin left his job at Facebook in 2012. He and I worked on a number of side projects, one of which eventually became Heap. Both him and I remained on our parents' insurance until Heap had enough funding and traction to offer health plans to employees. Again, without being able to remain on our parents' insurance, this would have been much more difficult.</p><br><p>Mike Romano, <a href="https://www.lendsnap.com/">Lendsnap</a>, S16</p><p>The ACA has been a blessing for me and my family, and without it, I could not pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I began my new career within days of the birth of my son, and the fact he arrived five weeks early only complicated plans further. My wife is a graphic designer and usually only finds contract work without benefits. The ACA allows me to follow my passion of transforming the mortgage industry while ensuring our son gets the crucial care he needs during his early life.</p><br><p>Brian Merritt, <a href="https://seed.co/">Seed</a>, W15</p><p>For me, the ACA was life changing. Prior to the ACA I was only able to obtain insurance either through an established group plan, or via Medical/Medicaid “last resort” insurance. This was because I have a pre-existing condition that made me ineligible to buy an individual insurance plan. Due to having a chronic condition that needs to be managed carefully, having a quality insurance plan was not an option, but a requirement. So my only option was to work for a large employer with an established health plan that would provide me with the appropriate benefits to support my situation. After the ACA made it so that pre-existing conditions don’t disqualify applicants, I was able to purchase an individual insurance plan outside of my employer, and as as a result I was able to start a company and work on it for almost two years before we were able to put our own group plan together.</p><br><p>Mick Johnson, Whereoscope, S10</p><p>The ACA was essential when starting my new business - I founded the company, was pre-funding for 9 months, and the only employee, so was unable to get small group coverage. I have a wife, a child, and another child on the way so health insurance was essential. Without the ACA I could never have left a regular job to found this new company, which has now raised funding and employs 7 people. </p><br><p>Kevin Law, <a href="https://www.cambly.com/">Cambly</a>, W14</p><p>I had to apply for individual health care twice while starting Cambly before the ACA exchanges launched at the end of 2013. It was incredibly difficult and expensive, because I had to keep paying for expensive COBRA coverage from my previous employer while repeatedly applying, appealing, and getting rejected by insurers for individual plans. I was still on a group plan during the ACA debates and assumed that the only people getting rejected were the chronically ill. I learned through my experience that nearly anyone who had past health care expenses would often be rejected when applying for individual plans (as was my case).</p><p>An especially ironic moment occurred when I was on a Blue Cross group plan via COBRA and appealing a rejection for a Blue Cross individual plan. I got a physical, so my doctor could write a letter saying I was in good health for the appeal. I simultaneously received a rejection letter for my individual plan appeal citing pasts health costs AND a letter from my group plan asking if the physical was related to a workplace incident (presumably so they could sue someone to get reimbursed for the costs).</p><p>The exchanges finally went live at the end of 2013, and I quickly got insurance coverage. No extensive health history paperwork. No rejections or appeals. It launched right around when we got into YC, so it was great to focus on building and growing our business rather than trying to obtain health insurance.</p><br><p>Tristan Tao, <a href="https://www.teamleada.com/">Leada</a>, S15</p><p>I'm currently 24 years old (going on 25). I am fortunately covered under my parent's health insurance under ACA (until I'm 26). This was critical in reducing my personal burn. I would not go without health insurance; this meant I'd have to either join a larger company to gain coverage, or purchase them out of pocket. Either way it would've significantly hindered the 22 yrs old me to start a company as a Senior in College.</p><p>I strongly hope that the successor of Obamacare will include a clause that makes it cheaper for recent graduates to get coverage (or retain the current policy of enabling people younger than 26 to stay on their parents' coverage).</p><p>Looking back, the largest hindrance to starting a company would've been debt (which I didn't have any), and personal burn (insurance being a huge part).</p><br><p>Ram Jayaraman, <a href="http://plateiq.com/">PlateIQ</a>, S15</p><p>5 out of 7 members of the initial team at Plate IQ were on ACA. Without ACA in the early days we would have to spend large amounts on employer health insurance and since the team was small we would not have gotten much discounts either. Since the team just needed something basic until we raise decent venture money, they were all able to find very affordable options with good networks like Kaiser.</p><p>In thinking of an ACA successor: very few plans are coupled with HSA accounts and HSA withdrawals are penalized. For startups with young teams I would ideally like to continue getting plans with large deductibles and large co-pays and instead contribute to an HSA account. Avoiding the 20% penalty for the HSA withdrawal would definitely encourage more participation.</p><br><p>Ben Thompson, <a href="https://www.gitprime.com/">Gitprime</a>, W16</p><p>I have a family of 5. Had it not been for the affordable care act, it would have been incredibly difficult to take the leap to become a co-founder. Because of the ACA, I was able to take a calculated career risk without having to sacrifice health coverage for my family as part of that decision. Two years later, we’ve built a company that provides benefits for all of our employees and their dependents.</p><br><p>Brendan Lim, Kicksend, S11</p><p>In 2009 my wife was in a life threatening car accident. After her recovery, she was unable to get reasonably priced coverage due to her new "pre-existing conditions". During this time, my co-founder and I had quit our jobs and started working on Kicksend (S11) and were living off of our savings. As a result, we were unable to afford reasonable insurance. The ACA removed the "pre-existing conditions" and gave us peace of mind since my wife was finally able to get covered.</p><br><p>Vishal Joshi, <a href="http://withjoy.com">Joy</a>, S16</p><p>When we started Joy, we had insurance as dependents and did not need to create company healthcare offer for a bit.  But soon we had a new employee very eager to join Joy but needed health insurance.  We agreed to start the process but it so happens that the entire ordeal to get company healthcare setup takes a couple of months.  If not for ACA, Joy would had lost a really good employee who is still with us and actually helped us build our website.  She was able to keep afloat using ACA while we got our company policy setup.</p><br><p>Jason Chen, <a href="https://www.vergegenomics.com/#main">Verge Genomics</a>, S15</p><p>The Affordable Care Act makes it easy for us to purchase and manage health insurance plans – all of our employees are covered rapidly with no medical underwriting. However, we pay high premiums, incur rising deductibles, and plans are bloated with benefits we cannot use. We have also had to pay for "retroactive coverage" for some employees to avoid penalties from the individual mandate, even though no services were used. Future patient-centered health reform should facilitate access to coverage for small business and individuals while allowing greater customization of benefits.</p><br><p>Zachary Garbow, SocialBrowse, W08</p><p>When I began working on my startup full time, my wife and I wanted to start a family. At that time, when trying to purchase private insurance being pregnant was considered a pre-existing condition. My wife also had undertaken some preventative procedures years earlier, which made it difficult to obtain coverage. As a result, we were stressed and anxious about not being able to get coverage, and fearful that we'd not be covered for our pregnancy and I'd have to quit my startup to find a corporate job with health insurance. Luckily, the ACA passed just in time to provide us the peace of mind to both start our family and continue building my startup. We now have 2 kids and a thriving, growing business.</p><br><p>Varun Aroroa, <a href="https://opencurriculum.org/">OpenCurriculum</a>, W14</p><p>ACA has allowed me to have health insurance. Before I got on Obamacare, I had no insurance and had stopped all physical activity beyond basic exercise for years, being too scared to hurt myself. Living below the adjusted poverty line, I just can't afford normal plans. It is amazing how much mental comfort and freedom it can bring in life.</p><br><p>Mike Knoop, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, S12</p><p>Thanks to the ACA and my parents, the provision to cover dependents through the age of 26 enabled me to take more risk starting Zapier. Specifically, I did not have to worry about healthcare coverage when the company was small and could not afford health benefits. Now, Zapier provides health benefit coverage to our 50+ US employees.</p><br><p>Zachariah Reitano, Shout, S14</p>I had heart surgery when I was 18. I was virtually uninsurable. I now have health insurance. Why we need the ACA is no more complicated than that.</div>]]>

    <title>The 2016 Election</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I am endorsing Hillary Clinton for
president.  I've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, but
I'm making an exception this year, because this election is exceptional. 
Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America, and voting for
Hillary is the best way to defend our country against it.</p>

<p>A Trump presidency would be a disaster
for the American
economy.  He has no real plan to restore economic growth.</p>

<p>His racist, isolationist policies would
divide our country, and American innovation would suffer.  But the man himself is
even more
dangerous
than his policies.  He's erratic, abusive, and prone to fits of rage.</p>

<p>He represents a real threat to the
safety of women, minorities, and immigrants, and I believe this reason alone
more than disqualifies him to be president. 
My godson’s father, who is Mexican by birth and fears being deported or
worse, is who convinced me to spend a significant amount of time working on
this election at the beginning of this year, when Trump still seemed like an
unlikely possibility.</p>

<p>Trump shows little respect for the
Constitution, the Republic, or for human decency, and I fear for national
security if he becomes our president.</p>

<p>The only two vocal Trump supporters I
am close to are Peter Thiel and my grandma.  Peter is a part-time partner
at YC, meaning he spends a small fraction of his time advising YC companies,
does not have a vote in how YC is run, and in his case waives the equity part-time
partners normally get.</p>

<p>This has been a strain on my
relationship with both of them—I think they are completely wrong in their
support of this man.  Though I don’t ascribe all positions of a politician
to his or her supporters, I do not understand how one continues to support
someone who brags about sexual assault, calls for a total and complete shutdown
of Muslims entering the US, or any number or other disqualifying
statements.  I will continue to try to
change both of their minds.</p>

<p>Some have said that YC should terminate
its relationship with Peter over this.  But as repugnant as Trump is to many of
us, we are not going to fire someone over his or her support of a political candidate. 
As far as we know, that would be unprecedented for supporting a major party
nominee, and a dangerous path to start down (of course, if Peter said some of
the things Trump says himself, he would no longer be part of Y
Combinator).  </p>

<p>The way we got into a situation with
Trump as a major party nominee in the first place was by not talking to people
who are very different than we are.  The polarization of the country into
two parallel political realities is not good for any of us.  We should listen to each
other more, not less.</p>

<p>We should all feel a duty to try to
understand the roughly half of the country that thinks we are severely
misguided.  I don’t understand how 43% of the country supports Trump.  But I’d like to find out, because we have to include everyone in
our path forward.  If our best ideas are to stop talking to or fire anyone
who disagrees with us, we’ll be facing this whole situation again in 2020.</p>

<p>That
kind of diversity is painful and unpopular, but it is critical to health of a
democratic and pluralistic society.  We shouldn’t start purging people for supporting
the wrong political candidate.  That's not how things are done in this country.</p></div>]]>

    <title>Don't Read The Comments</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p><i>I sent this email to the current YC batch this morning:</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>I've talked to some of you who are really bummed about negative press coverage or online comments about your company.  Often this takes the general form of "ugh, all these new startups suck, everything good has already been started."</p><div>It sucks to have haters, but every founder who now runs a huge company faced this for a long time.  Please don't let it get you down (some criticism is useful, and that you should pay attention to, but that's not normally what gets people down).  The sooner you can develop a thick skin for this, the better.<br><div><br></div>
<div>Unless the world ends soon, the most valuable company the world will ever see has not yet been started.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Most startups will fail, so you can say everything sucks and be right most of the time.  Although you never lose money with that strategy, you never make any either.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The best startups take a long time to be recognized as good.  Go read the things people wrote about Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, etc in their first few years of existence.  Overnight success usually takes a decade of uphill work.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>YC itself faced this for a long time.  We turned out to do ok.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>A friend of mine likes to say "there are two kinds of people in the world--the people that build the future, and the people who write posts on the internet about why they'll fail".  Keep trying to be in former category.</div>
</div><div><br></div><div>The people who have said there is nothing new left to do in the world have been wrong every time.  Don't let their lack of imagination hold you back.</div></div>]]>

    <title>Trump</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I'm going to say something
very unpopular in my world: Trump is right about some big things.</p>

<p>He's right that many
Americans are getting screwed by the system. 
He’s right that the economy is not growing nearly fast enough.  He's right that we're drowning in political
correctness, and that broken campaign finance laws have bred a class of
ineffective career politicians.  He may even be right that free trade is
not the best policy.  Trump supporters
are not dumb.</p>

<p>But Trump is wrong
about the more important part: how to fix these problems.  Many of his
proposals, such as they are, are so wrong they’re difficult to even respond to.</p>

<p>Even more dangerous,
though, is the way he's wrong.  He is not merely irresponsible.  He
is irresponsible in the way dictators are.</p>

<p>Trump's casual
racism, misogyny, and conspiracy theories are without precedent among major presidential
nominees.  He has said that a judge of
Mexican descent isn't treating him fairly because of his heritage and that we
should ban Muslims from entering the country.</p>

<p>When his supporters
beat up a homeless Hispanic man and cited Trump, he called them “very
passionate”.  He has accused Obama of somehow being
responsible for the recent shooting in Orlando.</p>

<p>To anyone familiar
with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it's chilling to watch Trump in
action.  Though I know intellectually it’s easy in hard economic times to
rile people up with a hatred of outsiders, it's still surprising to watch this
happen right in front of us.</p>

<p>It's hard to tell, as
it often is with demagogues, how much is calculation and how much is genuine
belief.  But it's a real and terrifying possibility that Trump actually
believes much of what he says.  In any
case, when he says it, it signals to other people that it’s ok to believe.</p>

<p>Demagogic
hate-mongers lead down terrible paths.  It would be particularly
embarrassing for us to fall for this—we are a nation of immigrants, and we know
that immigrants built this country (and Trump, of course, is the grandson of
immigrants and married to an immigrant).</p>

<p>Hitler taught us
about the Big Lie—the lie so big, and so often repeated, that people end up
believing it.</p>

<p>Trump’s Big Lie is
hiding in plain sight.  His Big Lie is
that he’s going to Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders.</p>

<p>But he has no serious
plan for how to restore economic growth, which is what we actually need.  Without it, we’ll be in a zero-sum game and
face continued infighting.  And without
it, we’ll lose our position as the most powerful country in the world.</p>

<p>He distracts us with
hate of outsiders in the hopes that we don’t notice he has no plan for the
inside. <b> </b>He has failed to put forward a serious
plan for major investments in research and technology that we so desperately
need.  Instead, he tries to distract us
with fear of Them.</p>

<p>At least Trump is
willing to talk about the fact that the US is not on an acceptable growth
trajectory.  The Big Truth in Trump’s
slogan is “Again”—we do need a fundamental change to get back to where we were.  Clinton’s dangerously bad Big Lie is that
there’s no big problem here at all.</p>

<p>Trump is right about
the problem, but horribly wrong about the solution.</p>

<p>I take some
risk by writing this (even though I’ve supported some Republicans in the past), and
I’ll feel bad if I end up hurting Y Combinator by doing so.  I understand why other people in the
technology industry aren’t saying much.  In an ordinary election it's
reasonable for people in the business world to remain publicly neutral.  But this is not an ordinary election.</p>

<p>In the words
of Edmund Burke, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for
good men to do nothing."  This would
be a good time for us all—even Republicans, especially Republican politicians who
previously endorsed Trump—to start speaking up.</p><p><br></p><p><i>Note: Anyone is welcome to republish this.</i><br></p><p><i>Note 2: Apparently the Burke quote was not definitively said by him :(</i></p></div>]]>

    <title>Housing in the Bay Area</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Jerry Brown has <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/budgeting/trailer_bill_language/local_government/documents/707StreamliningAffordableHousingApprovals_000.pdf">proposed legislation</a> that would allow a lot more housing to be built in the Bay Area, and hopefully significantly reduce the cost of housing here.

    <title>Cruise</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>There is a long and sordid history of people coming out of the
woodwork with bogus claims when huge amounts of money are on the line.  This has just happened to Cruise, which is run
by my friend Kyle Vogt.  Cruise is a
YC company, and I also personally invested in the company last year.</p>

<p>As detailed in a complaint filed by Kyle and Cruise, Jeremy
Guillory collaborated with Kyle for a very short period early on in the life of
Cruise.  I know that at least Kyle had
been thinking about autonomous vehicles for quite some time, and I assume
Jeremy had been too given all of the attention on the topic in the press about
Google’s activities.  After a little over a month, Kyle and Jeremy parted ways.  This event happened more than two years ago,
and well before the company had achieved much of anything. </p>

<p>There is more detail in this footnote [1] if you’re curious, or
you can read the complaint online <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/308408168/Cruise-v-Guillory-Complaint">here</a>.</p>

<p>Jeremy is now claiming to Kyle that he should own a substantial
amount of Cruise’s equity, and by doing so is interfering with the pending
Cruise/GM merger.</p>

<p>Kyle made an extremely generous offer to settle this claim by offering
to give Jeremy a lot of his own money. [2] In my opinion, Jeremy’s claim is completely
baseless and opportunistic—it obviously comes at a bad time for the company
with the merger still pending, and Kyle understandably wanted to avoid a
protracted litigation.  Kyle has worked
incredibly hard to settle this claim amicably, despite what I consider to be
the obvious ridiculousness of it, and has done far more than I would have
personally done under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Kyle and Cruise are now suing Jeremy for making a false equity
claim.  It’s an incredible bummer these situations have to happen in the
first place.  This is one of the least
sensible professional situations I’ve ever been involved with, but
unfortunately these situations are not uncommon.</p>

<p>I recognize that I place myself at risk talking about this, but
it’s time that someone speaks publicly about situations like what is happening
at Cruise.  And so I’ve decided to say
something before the lawyers can stop me. 
Even with this issue, both sides still expect the merger to close on
schedule in Q2.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>[1] Kyle and Jeremy applied to YC together but Jeremy left
before the YC interview.  Neither took a salary, and Kyle was funding the
company by himself at that point.</p>

<p>According to Kyle, Jeremy did not write any code or build any
hardware during this exploratory period.  He did help find an office for
the company.  At the point of Jeremy’s departure, neither he nor Kyle had
signed employment agreements, stock agreements, or any documents of any sort
with the company.  Even if Jeremy had signed a stock agreement, he
wouldn’t have reached the standard 1-year cliff for founders to vest any
equity.</p>

<p>Kyle told me that Jeremy would occasionally reach out to
congratulate him on press about Cruise (for example, he reached out to
congratulate Kyle on Cruise’s Series A), but he never asked for anything—until
now, when, in my opinion, he saw an opportunity to make a ton of money.</p>

<p>[2] I was personally involved all day on Friday last week to try
to help settle this claim.  Given the time pressure because of the pending
merger, we had to set a Friday at 5 pm deadline for Kyle’s offer, which Jeremy
let expire. </p></div>]]>

    <title>Asana</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I’m delighted to finally be <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2016/03/asana-raising-50m-for-work-tracking/">investing in Asana</a>, which I’ve
wanted to do for a long time.</p>

<p>One of the things I’ve learned about companies is that 1) clear
tasks and goals, 2) clearly communicated, and 3) with clear and frequent
measurement are very important to success. 
Most companies fail at all 3 of these, and they become more important as
companies get bigger.  Asana is the best way to excel in these 3 areas.</p>

<p>“You make what you measure” is really true, and most companies
don’t measure well at all.  I spend a lot
of time talking to people who work at startups, and most employees feel like
they don’t have a good sense of what specifically the company needs to get done
and how all the tasks are going.  Better
work tracking leads to better collaboration and better decision-making.</p>

<p>Another thing I’ve learned investing in startups is how
important it is to have some users that really love a product (instead of
liking it pretty much).  Asana has the
level of product love that all great companies have in common.  As a small example, their recurring revenue
has been incredibly sticky and more than doubled every year.</p>

<p>Asana is the kind of lever that could someday massively increase
the productivity of hundreds of millions of people around the world.  There’s not only an opportunity for Asana to
be a huge company, but also for Asana to materially increase the output for the
planet—somewhat amazingly, software has not yet eaten this important part of
the world. </p>

<p>Finally, Asana has an incredible team that, as far as I can tell
as an outsider, really believes in the mission and loves the work environment
(the Glassdoor reviews, something I check before every late-stage investment,
are among the best I’ve ever seen). </p>

<p>These
are all the ingredients that go into the development of an incredibly impactful
and valuable company.  I’m very happy to
be along for the ride.</p></div>]]>

    <title>Hard Tech is Back</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>First of all, congrats to Kyle, Dan, and the rest of the Cruise
team.  You all have made amazing progress and we look forward to seeing
more in the future. </p>

<p>A popular criticism of Silicon Valley, usually levied by people
not building anything at all themselves, is that no one is working on or
funding “hard technology”.  While we disagree with this
premise—many of the most important companies start out looking trivial—we want
to be clear that we’re actively looking to fund more hard tech companies, and
would love to see more get started.</p>

<p>At YC, we started funding these sorts of companies in earnest in 2014,
to widespread commentary that this was a silly waste of time. 
Cruise, which we funded that winter, is <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/">getting acquired by GM</a>.  From the Summer 2014 batch, 3 of the 4 companies who have raised the most money
since graduating YC are “hard tech” companies.</p>

<p>We expect many more big wins.  The YC model works much
better for these sorts of companies ﻿than most people, including
ourselves, thought.</p>

<p>So, if you’re thinking about starting one, we’d like to
talk.  And we think we can help. (You’ll probably find a lot of other
people willing to help too, although unfortunately you’ll still face major
fundraising challenges.  But in many ways, it’s easier to start a hard
company than an easy company—more people want to join the mission.)</p>

<p>Leave the Medium thought pieces about when the stock market is
going to crash and the effect it’s going to have on the fundraising environment
to other people—it’s boring, and history will forget those people anyway.
  There has never been a better time to take a long-term view and use
technology to solve major problems, and we’ve never needed the solutions more
than we do right now.</p>

<p>Different YC partners have different interests, but I’m
particularly excited about AI (both general AI and narrow AI applied to
specific industries, which seems like the most obvious win in all of startups
right now), biotech, and energy. </p>

<p>We
hope to hear from you.</p></div>]]>

    <title>Before Growth</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>We tell startups all the time that they have to grow quickly.  That’s true, and very good advice, but I think the current fashion of Silicon Valley startups has taken this to an unhealthy extreme—startups have a weekly growth goal before they really have any strong idea about what they want to build.</p>
<p>In the first few weeks of a startup’s life, the founders really need to figure out what they’re doing and why.  Then they need to build a product some users really love.  Only after that they should focus on growth above all else.</p>
<p>A startup that prematurely targets a growth goal often ends up making a nebulous product that some users sort of like and papering over this with ‘growth hacking’.  That sort of works—at least, it will fool investors for awhile until they start digging into retention numbers—but eventually the music stops.</p>
<p>I think the right initial metric is “do any users love our product so much they spontaneously tell other people to use it?”  Until that’s a “yes”, founders are generally better off focusing on this instead of a growth target.</p>
<p>The very best technology companies sometimes take awhile to figure out exactly what they’re doing, but when they do, they usually pass that binary test before turning all their energy to growth.  It’s the critical ingredient for companies that do really well [1], and if you don’t figure it out, no amount of growth hacking will make you into a great company. </p>
<p>As a side note, startups that don’t first figure out a product some users love also seem to rarely develop the sense of mission that the best companies have.</p><p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[1] The other thing that these companies have, and that also usually gets figured out early, is some sort of a monopoly.</p></div>]]>

    <title>The Tech Bust of 2015</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Maybe instead of a tech bubble, we’re in a tech bust.  No one seems to fervently believe tech
valuations are cheap, so it’d be somewhat surprising if we were in a bubble.  In many parts of the market, valuations seem too cheap.  In the part where they seem too high, maybe they
aren’t really valuations at all, because the deal structure has changed to
become more like debt.<br></p>

<p>Many of the small cap public tech companies have taken a
beating this year.  Companies like Yelp
are trading at less than 4 times trailing revenue.</p>

<p>The tech mega-caps are monopolies and have deservedly high
valuations.  But even then, I would not
be willing to short a single one of Apple, Google, Amazon, or Facebook against
the S&amp;P.  Apple in particular trades
at a single-digit ex-cash forward P/E.</p>

<p>2015 has seen the lowest level of tech IPOs as a percentage
of all IPOs in seven years.  The S&amp;P
Tech P/E is lower than the overall S&amp;P P/E.  Neither of these facts seems suggestive of a tech bubble.</p>

<p>On the private side, people complain all the time about
early-stage valuations (and to be fair, they’ve felt high to me for four years).  But if you invested in every single YC
company over the past three years at their Demo Day valuation (average Demo Day
valuations haven’t moved much in the past three years) you’d be very happy, even
though investors complain that YC is the worst example of overpriced companies.</p>

<p>The mid-stages also seem generally reasonable, though of
course there are notable exceptions. 
These exceptions get all the attention—not the hundreds of companies
doing remarkably well, but that handful that have raised money at high
valuations and are struggling or dead. </p>

<p>On the whole, it seems harder than any time in the past four
years to raise mid-stage rounds.  This is also not suggestive of a bubble. </p>

<p>So where is the problem? 
Late-stage private valuations. 
But perhaps the answer is that these “investments” aren’t really equity—they’re
much more like debt. [1] I saw terms recently that had a 2x liquidation
preference (i.e. the investors got the first 2x their money out of the company
when it exited) and a 3x liquidation cap (i.e. after they made 3x their money,
they didn’t get any more of the proceeds).</p>

<p>This is hardly an equity instrument at all. [2] The example here is an extreme case, but not
wildly so.  Investors are buying debt but
dressing it up close enough to equity to maintain their venture capital fund
exemption status.  In a world of 0
percent interest rates, people become pretty focused on finding new sources for
fixed income.</p>

<p>There is a massive disconnect in late-stage preferred stock, because if
you’re using it to synthesize debt it doesn’t matter what the price is.  The closer the rounds get to common stock (a
less-than-1x liquidation preference, for example), the more I think the
valuation means something. 
Unsurprisingly, the best companies usually have the most common-stock-like
terms (and “the best companies” are never the ones that seem overpriced for
long anyway).</p>

<p>Some of this debt is poorly underwritten.  Some unicorns will surely die (and those are
the ones everyone will talk about).  That
doesn’t make it a tech bubble.  It’d be
more accurate to say it’s a tech bubble if no unicorns die in the next couple
of years. </p>

<p>To summarize: there does not appear to be a tech bubble in
the public markets.  There does not
appear to be a bubble in early or mid stages of the private markets.  There does appear to be a bubble in the
late-stage private companies, but that’s because people are misunderstanding
these financial instruments as equity. 
If you reclassify those rounds as debt, then it gets hard to say where
exactly the bubble is.</p>

<p>At some point, I expect LPs to realize that buying debt in
late-stage tech companies is not what they signed up for, and then prices in
late-stage private companies will appear to correct.  And I think that the entire public market is
likely to go down—perhaps substantially—when interest rates materially move up,
though that may be a long time away.  But
I expect public tech companies are likely to trade with the rest of the market and
not underperform. </p>

<p>But no matter what happens in the short- and medium-term, I continue to believe technology is the future, and I still can’t think of an asset I’d
rather own and not think about for a decade or two than a basket of public or
private tech stocks.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks to Jack Altman, Patrick Collison, Paul Graham, Aaron
Levie, Geoff Ralston, and Ali Rowghani for reading draft of this. </p>

<p>[1] There are real problems with these distorted "valuations".  Employees these companies
hire often think of them as real valuations. 
It also often makes the company think of itself as much bigger than it
is, and do the wrong things for its actual stage.  Finally, too much cheap money lets companies
operate with bad unit economics and cover up all sorts of internal
problems.  So I think many companies are
hurting themselves with access to easy capital.</p>

<p>[2] Even before the shift to debt-like rounds, the
disconnect between how much people will pay for 5% of a company in preferred
stock vs. 100% of a company in common stock was massive (and for good
reason--the downside protection alone with preferred stock makes it much different than common stock).  As this delta has accentuated,
the public/private disconnect has gotten worse, and caused a number of
problems for companies accustomed to valuations always going up.</p></div>]]>

    <title>Airbnb and San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Airbnb has recently been attacked by San Francisco politicians for driving up the price of housing in the city.  San Francisco has tried, and will continue to try, to ban Airbnb in various ways.  Last week, <a href="https://medium.com/@emeyerson/prop-f-is-worse-than-you-think-17e395ca8761">this excellent post</a> was published on Prop F—“the Airbnb law”. </p><p>I recently reached out to Brian Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, to learn more about this. I am decidedly a non-expert on this topic, but here are some thoughts from a layperson.</p><p>I met Brian in 2008, when he started Airbedandbreakfast as…an affordable housing company.  He couldn’t afford to pay his rent in 10 days and his credit cards were maxed out.  He looked around and realized that he did have one asset he could monetize—his extra space.  And eventually, Airbnb was born and the sharing economy began.</p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of other people have problems paying their rent or mortgage.  75% of Airbnb hosts in San Francisco say that their income from Airbnb helps them stay in their homes, and 60% of the Airbnb income goes to rent/mortgage and other housing expenses. Making it harder to use Airbnb in San Francisco may make it impossible for some of these hosts to afford to stay in their homes and in this city.</p><p>In 2014 (the most recent year with available data) there were about 387,000 housing units in SF.  About 38% were owner-occupied, and the remaining 62% or 240,000 were rental units.  About 33,000 of these were vacant, generally as a side effect of rent control laws.  (I don’t honestly know if rent control is a net good or bad thing—I assume more good than bad—but it certainly keeps units off the market.) [1]<br></p><p>In the past year, only about 340 units in SF were rented on Airbnb more than 211 nights, which is what Airbnb has calculated as the break-even point compared to long-term rental.  This is less than one out of every thousand units of housing in SF.  Looking at it another way, it’s just over 1.1% of all <i>unoccupied</i> units.  </p><p>There have been about 10,700 SF units that have rented on Airbnb in the last year (obviously a much lower number of units are actively listed at any particular time).  The median number of trips per unit was 5, and mean was 13.3.  The mean revenue per host was about $13,000 per year.  More than 90 percent of Airbnb hosts in SF are listing their primary residence, and making money with an extra room or their entire place when they are out of town.</p><p>The whole magic of the sharing economy is better asset utilization and thus lower prices for everyone.  Home sharing makes better utilization out of a fixed asset, and by more optimally filling space it means the same number of people can use less supply.  In fact, Airbnb worked with economist Tom Davidoff of the University of British Columbia and found that Airbnb has affected the price of housing in SF by less than 1% either up or down.</p><p>But in the last 5 years, the cost of housing in the city has about doubled.  The reason for this is a lot more people want to live in SF than we have housing for, and the city has been slow to approve new construction.  Who is to blame for this?  The same politicians that are trying to distract you with Airbnb’s 340 “professionally rented” units.</p><p>What should the politicians actually be doing about the housing crunch?  The obvious answer would be to support building more housing and fixing the supply side of the equation.  But instead they’re doing the opposite (e.g. a moratorium on new construction in the Mission) and trying to turn Airbnb into a scapegoat.</p><p>I love San Francisco. I wish housing here were much cheaper.  This is a special city and more people are going to want to live here, and more are going to want to come visit and do business with people here. Instead of trying to ban the future, we should be making it easier for middle class families to stay in the city.  We can do this by building more units to push the market price of housing down and by making it easier for San Franciscans to share their homes.</p><div><br></div><div>[1] Selected Housing Characteristics, 2014 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates</div><br><i>Disclosure:</i><i> I own a significant amount of Airbnb stock.</i></div>]]>
