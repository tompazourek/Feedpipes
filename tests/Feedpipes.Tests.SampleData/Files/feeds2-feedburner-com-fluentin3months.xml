<p>読。書。聞。話。。。</p>
<p>Do you know those kanji yet? They’re some of the JLPT N5 kanji. If you’re going to take the test, it’s time to memorize them!</p>
<p>If you don’t know, “JLPT” stands for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. It’s one of the most well-known and acknowledged tests for Japanese proficiency around the world, with five levels of proficiency. N1 is the hardest level, considered near-fluent. N5 is the easiest level, covering the basic level of Japanese.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to test your skills and see where you’re at in Japanese, the JLPT is a great place to try it out. So here’s your quick guide to learning the necessary JLPT N5 kanji.</p>
<h2 id="whattoexpectonthejlptn5test">What to Expect on the JLPT N5 Test</h2>
<p>Even though the JLPT N5 test is the most basic formal Japanese test, passing the test is still a big achievement.</p>
<p>To pass the JLPT N5 test, you have to be able to read Japanese at a basic level and understand simple conversations from daily life and school. You should know around 800 vocabulary words. I recommend starting with the <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/core-japanese-words/">Core 101 Japanese words</a>, and about 50 basic grammar patterns.</p>
<p>My two favorite resources for studying grammar at this level are <a href="http://a-fwd.com/it=fluein3mont-21&amp;uk=fluein3mont-21&amp;ca=fluein3mont-20&amp;com=fluein3mont-20&amp;s=GENKI+I%3A+An+Integrated+Course+in+Elementary+Japanese&amp;asin=4789014401">Genki I</a> and <a href="https://japanesetest4you.com/jlpt-n5-grammar-list/">JTest4U</a>. Plus, you’ll need to be totally comfortable reading all the <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/hiragana-vs-katakana/">hiragana and katakana</a> characters.</p>
<h2 id="whyyouneedtoknowkanjiforthejlptn5test">Why You Need to Know Kanji for the JLPT N5 Test</h2>
<p>One of the most daunting tasks when starting to learn Japanese? Kanji.</p>
<p>At the N5 level, the JLPT expects you to know about 100 kanji to pass. These kanji can change slightly between tests, but you can generally expect to see the 100 most common kanji for verbs, numbers, time, places, people, basic adjectives, and directions.</p>
<p>The good news? These kanji are used so often you’ll see them over and over again in the vocab you learn and the texts you read. The bad news is that you’ll need to independently memorize most of these kanji because they’re radicals, or roots. Radicals in Japanese are simple kanji -- they’re the building blocks that make up complex kanji.</p>
<p>So, the more radicals you learn in kanji, the easier it becomes to understand more complex kanji. Learning the radicals first, then advancing onto complex kanji, is the most popular method for memorizing kanji (more on that later). For the first 100, because they’re radicals, you’ve just got to memorize them.</p>
<p>That being said, you can still come up with <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/imagination-your-key-to-memorizing-hundreds-of-words-quickly/">mnemonics</a> to help you remember the kanji and their readings -- and I highly recommend that you do, because it will help you immensely down the road.</p>
<h2 id="japanesen5kanjilistthe100kanjiyouneedtoknowforthejlptn5">Japanese N5 Kanji List -- the 100 Kanji You Need to Know for the JLPT N5</h2>
<p>Alright, so let’s start learning these kanji! I’ve broken them up into categories, such as numbers, time, people and places, because I’ve found that kanji are easiest to learn when I associate them with related words.</p>
<p>In the lists below, you’ll see the kanji and the English meaning, followed by the <em>onyomi</em> and <em>kunyomi</em> readings.</p>
<p>Why these different readings? Kanji originated with Chinese <em>hànzì</em> characters which the Japanese adapted and gave Japanese readings. Thus, <em>onyomi</em> (Chinese readings) and <em>kunyomi</em> (Japanese readings) were born. Almost all kanji have two readings (and most, unfortunately, have many more than two). A rare few gems will only have one reading.</p>
<p>For the most part, these different readings are less important for the JLPT N5. <strong>If you learn these kanji with a vocab word that might also be on the test, then you should be able to remember the most common reading.</strong> This won’t <em>always</em> be true, but it usually will be. It’ll help you get the most out of your study time.</p>
<p>For that reason, I also include an N5 vocabulary word that uses that kanji.</p>
<h3 id="japanesekanjifornumbers">Japanese Kanji for Numbers</h3>
<p>First, let’s look at numbers. The first three are very straightforward to remember: a single line (one), two lines (two), three lines (three). Easy.</p>
<p>The rest can be more difficult. The drawback is that most of the time in Japan, they use 1 - 10 romanized numbers instead of kanji. But you still have to learn them. Be careful with 千: it looks almost identical to チ (katakana <em>chi</em>) and one of the readings is the same.</p>
<p>Also, you may think 万年筆 (“fountain pen”) will never show up in the JLPT N5 and yet it somehow it always does. It translates as “ten thousand year writing brush” aka a pen that outlasts all others.</p>

<h3 id="japanesekanjifortime">Japanese Kanji for Time</h3>
<p>These kanji are often used together with numbers, so I’ve included them next. You’ll pair numbers up with kanji like 月 to create the months of the year, like 一月 (“January”).</p>
<p>Some of the kanji on this list have more uses than just time, such as 来る which is an irregular verb. But, 来 also reads as らい, meaning “future”. Combined with other time kanji you get: 来週 (“next week”), 来月 (“next month”), and 来年 (“next year”).</p>

<h3 id="japanesekanjiforpeoplethings">Japanese Kanji for People &amp; Things</h3>
<p>This category includes many of the basic natural elements (very important in Japanese culture, so they pop up a lot), people, and body parts. Because these kanji are used in so many words, they’ve evolved the most over time and have a lot of readings. I’ve included most of the top ones to know, but you’ll often find these have irregular readings, too.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, 母 and 父. When talking about your own mom and dad to others, you would read/say them as <em>haha</em> and <em>chichi</em>. But when talking to your parents, they would be <em>kaa</em> as in <em>okaasan</em> (お母さん) and <em>tou</em> as in <em>otousan</em> (お父さん). These kanji also change when used for grandparents, aunts, and uncles.</p>
<p>Just be on the lookout. You’ll have to memorize them on a word-by-word basis.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to memorize <em>each</em> reading really well for these common kanji. 店 is read as <em>ten</em> almost as often as <em>mise</em>. 外 is just as often read as <em>gai</em> as it is <em>soto</em>. But, they have patterns. 店 reads as <em>ten</em> when combined with other kanji, like 喫茶店. On its own, it’s <em>mise</em>. It’s the same with 外: <em>gai</em> describes something foreign or outside the norm of one’s own country or group. <em>Soto</em> is used to just say “outside.”</p>

<p>These are among the most common verbs, besides する (<em>suru</em>, “to do”) which doesn’t use kanji. When used as verbs, you’ll almost always be using the <em>kunyomi</em> readings. For this test, those are the readings you’ll most likely be quizzed on, and the <em>onyomi</em> reading will be less important.</p>
<p>The most important <em>onyomi</em> readings that may pop up would be for 聞, 読, 書, 食, and 会. The first three -- hear, read, and write -- appear in their <em>onyomi</em> readings in the test descriptions themselves that state the test section you’re on. Most likely you won’t be quizzed on them, but you’ll want to know them to understand what you’re looking at on the test. The last two -- eat and meet -- have common <em>onyomi</em> readings like 食品 (“food,” or “food goods”) and 会社 (<em>company</em>).</p>

<h3 id="japanesekanjiforadjectives">Japanese Kanji for Adjectives</h3>
<p>Lastly, we have the most basic and common adjectives to describe things. You will most likely be quizzed on the <em>kunyomi</em> readings, as those are more commonly used as adjectives, while the <em>onyomi</em> readings combine with other kanji to give a more descriptive noun.</p>
<p>For example, 小 (little) + 学校 (school) means “elementary school.” You’ll definitely need to know them for later tests and vocab, but for N5 purposes your time would be better focused reviewing the <em>kunyomi</em> readings.</p>

<h2 id="japanesekanjipracticethebestwaystomemorizekanji">Japanese Kanji Practice: The Best Ways to Memorize Kanji</h2>
<p>Okay, so now you’ve seen the JLPT N5 kanji lists and know what you should study. But what’s the <em>best</em> way to memorize kanji?</p>
<p>The best way to practice kanji is to use a combination of <a href="http://a-fwd.com/it=fluein3mont-21&amp;uk=fluein3mont-21&amp;ca=fluein3mont-20&amp;com=fluein3mont-20&amp;s=Remembering+the+Kanji+1&amp;asin=0824835921">James Heisig’s Remembering the Kanji</a> method, the <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/">Anki app</a>, and your own mnemonics. You can definitely do it in as few as four days if you followed <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/2k-kanji/">this schedule to learn all the essential kanji in three months</a>.</p>
<p>Heisig’s method is one of the best methods to memorize kanji. He introduces the kanji based on radical elements so you can learn each one by “stacking” your mnemonic stories together. It’s really ingenious. It still takes effort, time, and patience. But it’s worth it!</p>
<p>Alongside that, l use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956">NihongoShark kanji deck in the Anki app</a>, or create your own Anki deck specifically for N5 kanji only. Enter in your mnemonic phrases and how to read them. Bonus points if you can tie how to read the kanji (or a word that uses it) into your mnemonic phrase.</p>
<p>I also suggest using <a href="http://a-fwd.com/it=fluein3mont-21&amp;uk=fluein3mont-21&amp;ca=fluein3mont-20&amp;com=fluein3mont-20&amp;s=GENKI+I%3A+An+Integrated+Course+in+Elementary+Japanese&amp;asin=4789014401">Genki I</a> and <a href="https://japanesetest4you.com/jlpt-n5-grammar-list/">JTest4U</a>, the most popular textbook for beginner Japanese that I mentioned earlier. It has a section in the back dedicated to learning kanji and reading practice that uses those kanji. It helps reinforce what you’re learning, at your level, without being incredibly tiresome.</p>
<p>And honestly, the sooner you knock out kanji, the better. Kanji helps you memorize vocab better, read with ease (making learning through native resources <strong>much</strong> easier), and have a deeper understanding of how the language works. And if you knock out these 100 kanji quickly, you can move on to focusing on the truly difficult parts of the test -- like listening comprehension.</p>
<p>It may seem impossible to memorize the kanji quickly, but you will get there.</p>
<p>Drill. Everyday. Rinse and repeat until the test!</p>
<p>Of course, there are other methods or apps you can use to learn the kanji. But this is how I learned, and how many others have learned with success.</p>
<h2 id="goodluckeveryone">頑張って、皆さん！ (Good luck, Everyone!)</h2>
<p>Don’t let the JLPT N5 test intimidate you -- you’ve got this! The best advice I have? Try to relax and keep calm. If you go in stressed and nervous, you may struggle to focus, especially when listening.</p>
<p>What are your best tips for learning the kanji? Are there other methods or apps that have helped you? Leave a comment and share your thoughts!</p>
<p>And most importantly, 頑張って、皆さん！</p>

Do you know those kanji yet? They’re some of the JLPT N5 kanji. If you’re going to take the test, it’s time to memorize them!

If you don’t know, “JLPT” stands for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. It’s one of the most well-known and acknowledged tests for Japanese proficiency around the world, with five levels of proficiency. N1 is the hardest level, considered near-fluent. N5 is the easiest level, covering the basic level of Japanese.

If you’re looking to test your skills and see where you’re at in Japanese, the JLPT is a great place to try it out. So here’s your quick guide to learning the necessary JLPT N5 kanji.
<h2 id="whattoexpectonthejlptn5test">What to Expect on the JLPT N5 Test</h2>
Even though the JLPT N5 test is the most basic formal Japanese test, passing the test is still a big achievement.

To pass the JLPT N5 test, you have to be able to read Japanese at a basic level and understand simple conversations from daily life and school. You should know around 800 vocabulary words. I recommend starting with the <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/core-japanese-words/">Core 101 Japanese words</a>, and about 50 basic grammar patterns.

My two favorite resources for studying grammar at this level are <a href="http://a-fwd.com/it=fluein3mont-21&amp;uk=fluein3mont-21&amp;ca=fluein3mont-20&amp;com=fluein3mont-20&amp;s=GENKI+I%3A+An+Integrated+Course+in+Elementary+Japanese&amp;asin=4789014401">Genki I</a> and <a href="https://japanesetest4you.com/jlpt-n5-grammar-list/">JTest4U</a>. Plus, you’ll need to be totally comfortable reading all the <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/hiragana-vs-katakana/">hiragana and katakana</a> characters.
<h2 id="whyyouneedtoknowkanjiforthejlptn5test">Why You Need to Know Kanji for the JLPT N5 Test</h2>
One of the most daunting tasks when starting to learn Japanese? Kanji.

At the N5 level, the JLPT expects you to know about 100 kanji to pass. These kanji can change slightly between tests, but you can generally expect to see the 100 most common kanji for verbs, numbers, time, places, people, basic adjectives, and directions.

The good news? These kanji are used so often you’ll see them over and over again in the vocab you learn and the texts you read. The bad news is that you’ll need to independently memorize most of these kanji because they’re radicals, or roots. Radicals in Japanese are simple kanji -- they’re the building blocks that make up complex kanji.

So, the more radicals you learn in kanji, the easier it becomes to understand more complex kanji. Learning the radicals first, then advancing onto complex kanji, is the most popular method for memorizing kanji (more on that later). For the first 100, because they’re radicals, you’ve just got to memorize them.

That being said, you can still come up with <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/imagination-your-key-to-memorizing-hundreds-of-words-quickly/">mnemonics</a> to help you remember the kanji and their readings -- and I highly recommend that you do, because it will help you immensely down the road.
<h2 id="japanesen5kanjilistthe100kanjiyouneedtoknowforthejlptn5">Japanese N5 Kanji List -- the 100 Kanji You Need to Know for the JLPT N5</h2>
Alright, so let’s start learning these kanji! I’ve broken them up into categories, such as numbers, time, people and places, because I’ve found that kanji are easiest to learn when I associate them with related words.

In the lists below, you’ll see the kanji and the English meaning, followed by the <em>onyomi</em> and <em>kunyomi</em> readings.

Why these different readings? Kanji originated with Chinese <em>hànzì</em> characters which the Japanese adapted and gave Japanese readings. Thus, <em>onyomi</em> (Chinese readings) and <em>kunyomi</em> (Japanese readings) were born. Almost all kanji have two readings (and most, unfortunately, have many more than two). A rare few gems will only have one reading.

For the most part, these different readings are less important for the JLPT N5. <strong>If you learn these kanji with a vocab word that might also be on the test, then you should be able to remember the most common reading.</strong> This won’t <em>always</em> be true, but it usually will be. It’ll help you get the most out of your study time.

For that reason, I also include an N5 vocabulary word that uses that kanji.
<h3 id="japanesekanjifornumbers">Japanese Kanji for Numbers</h3>
First, let’s look at numbers. The first three are very straightforward to remember: a single line (one), two lines (two), three lines (three). Easy.

The rest can be more difficult. The drawback is that most of the time in Japan, they use 1 - 10 romanized numbers instead of kanji. But you still have to learn them. Be careful with 千: it looks almost identical to チ (katakana <em>chi</em>) and one of the readings is the same.

Also, you may think 万年筆 (“fountain pen”) will never show up in the JLPT N5 and yet it somehow it always does. It translates as “ten thousand year writing brush” aka a pen that outlasts all others.

<h3 id="japanesekanjifortime">Japanese Kanji for Time</h3>
These kanji are often used together with numbers, so I’ve included them next. You’ll pair numbers up with kanji like 月 to create the months of the year, like 一月 (“January”).

Some of the kanji on this list have more uses than just time, such as 来る which is an irregular verb. But, 来 also reads as らい, meaning “future”. Combined with other time kanji you get: 来週 (“next week”), 来月 (“next month”), and 来年 (“next year”).

<h3 id="japanesekanjiforpeoplethings">Japanese Kanji for People &amp; Things</h3>
This category includes many of the basic natural elements (very important in Japanese culture, so they pop up a lot), people, and body parts. Because these kanji are used in so many words, they’ve evolved the most over time and have a lot of readings. I’ve included most of the top ones to know, but you’ll often find these have irregular readings, too.

Consider, for example, 母 and 父. When talking about your own mom and dad to others, you would read/say them as <em>haha</em> and <em>chichi</em>. But when talking to your parents, they would be <em>kaa</em> as in <em>okaasan</em> (お母さん) and <em>tou</em> as in <em>otousan</em> (お父さん). These kanji also change when used for grandparents, aunts, and uncles.

Just be on the lookout. You’ll have to memorize them on a word-by-word basis.

It’s a good idea to memorize <em>each</em> reading really well for these common kanji. 店 is read as <em>ten</em> almost as often as <em>mise</em>. 外 is just as often read as <em>gai</em> as it is <em>soto</em>. But, they have patterns. 店 reads as <em>ten</em> when combined with other kanji, like 喫茶店. On its own, it’s <em>mise</em>. It’s the same with 外: <em>gai</em> describes something foreign or outside the norm of one’s own country or group. <em>Soto</em> is used to just say “outside.”

These are among the most common verbs, besides する (<em>suru</em>, “to do”) which doesn’t use kanji. When used as verbs, you’ll almost always be using the <em>kunyomi</em> readings. For this test, those are the readings you’ll most likely be quizzed on, and the <em>onyomi</em> reading will be less important.

The most important <em>onyomi</em> readings that may pop up would be for 聞, 読, 書, 食, and 会. The first three -- hear, read, and write -- appear in their <em>onyomi</em> readings in the test descriptions themselves that state the test section you’re on. Most likely you won’t be quizzed on them, but you’ll want to know them to understand what you’re looking at on the test. The last two -- eat and meet -- have common <em>onyomi</em> readings like 食品 (“food,” or “food goods”) and 会社 (<em>company</em>).

<h3 id="japanesekanjiforadjectives">Japanese Kanji for Adjectives</h3>
Lastly, we have the most basic and common adjectives to describe things. You will most likely be quizzed on the <em>kunyomi</em> readings, as those are more commonly used as adjectives, while the <em>onyomi</em> readings combine with other kanji to give a more descriptive noun.

For example, 小 (little) + 学校 (school) means “elementary school.” You’ll definitely need to know them for later tests and vocab, but for N5 purposes your time would be better focused reviewing the <em>kunyomi</em> readings.

<h2 id="japanesekanjipracticethebestwaystomemorizekanji">Japanese Kanji Practice: The Best Ways to Memorize Kanji</h2>
Okay, so now you’ve seen the JLPT N5 kanji lists and know what you should study. But what’s the <em>best</em> way to memorize kanji?

The best way to practice kanji is to use a combination of <a href="http://a-fwd.com/it=fluein3mont-21&amp;uk=fluein3mont-21&amp;ca=fluein3mont-20&amp;com=fluein3mont-20&amp;s=Remembering+the+Kanji+1&amp;asin=0824835921">James Heisig’s Remembering the Kanji</a> method, the <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/">Anki app</a>, and your own mnemonics. You can definitely do it in as few as four days if you followed <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/2k-kanji/">this schedule to learn all the essential kanji in three months</a>.

Heisig’s method is one of the best methods to memorize kanji. He introduces the kanji based on radical elements so you can learn each one by “stacking” your mnemonic stories together. It’s really ingenious. It still takes effort, time, and patience. But it’s worth it!

Alongside that, l use the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956">NihongoShark kanji deck in the Anki app</a>, or create your own Anki deck specifically for N5 kanji only. Enter in your mnemonic phrases and how to read them. Bonus points if you can tie how to read the kanji (or a word that uses it) into your mnemonic phrase.

I also suggest using <a href="http://a-fwd.com/it=fluein3mont-21&amp;uk=fluein3mont-21&amp;ca=fluein3mont-20&amp;com=fluein3mont-20&amp;s=GENKI+I%3A+An+Integrated+Course+in+Elementary+Japanese&amp;asin=4789014401">Genki I</a> and <a href="https://japanesetest4you.com/jlpt-n5-grammar-list/">JTest4U</a>, the most popular textbook for beginner Japanese that I mentioned earlier. It has a section in the back dedicated to learning kanji and reading practice that uses those kanji. It helps reinforce what you’re learning, at your level, without being incredibly tiresome.

And honestly, the sooner you knock out kanji, the better. Kanji helps you memorize vocab better, read with ease (making learning through native resources <strong>much</strong> easier), and have a deeper understanding of how the language works. And if you knock out these 100 kanji quickly, you can move on to focusing on the truly difficult parts of the test -- like listening comprehension.

It may seem impossible to memorize the kanji quickly, but you will get there.

Drill. Everyday. Rinse and repeat until the test!

Of course, there are other methods or apps you can use to learn the kanji. But this is how I learned, and how many others have learned with success.
<h2 id="goodluckeveryone">頑張って、皆さん！ (Good luck, Everyone!)</h2>
Don’t let the JLPT N5 test intimidate you -- you’ve got this! The best advice I have? Try to relax and keep calm. If you go in stressed and nervous, you may struggle to focus, especially when listening.

What are your best tips for learning the kanji? Are there other methods or apps that have helped you? Leave a comment and share your thoughts!

And most importantly, 頑張って、皆さん！<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/jlpt-n5-kanji/">Japanese N5 Kanji List: All 100 Kanji You Need to Know to Pass the JLPT N5</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fluentin3months.com">Fluent in 3 months - Language Hacking and Travel Tips</a>.</p>

<p>The Spanish language and culture are rich in passionate language and ways to express affection. But what’s the <em>best</em> way to tell someone “I love you” in Spanish?</p>
<p>After all, in English, we tend to overuse the word “love”. We love this show, and we love that book. We love our parents, our kids and our spouse. We love our friends, we love our jobs.</p>
<p>And even though <em>all</em> of those forms of “love” are different, they’re expressed with the same word: “love”.</p>
<p>In Spanish, that’s not the case.</p>
<p>You have many options for expressing your affection! In fact, it’s one of the things I like about Spanish <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/words-english-needs/">that English is missing</a>. You can concisely share your like, love or even <em>enchantment</em> in Spanish, using different expressions.</p>
<h2 id="howtosayiloveyouinspanish">How to Say “I Love You” in Spanish</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, how to say “I love you” in Spanish depends on the context, situation and what or who you’re talking about. Most people have learned that <em>te amo</em> means “I love you” in Spanish, and it does. But this is a very serious, deep love. It’s used mostly between spouses and when announcing your love, such as while proposing.</p>
<p>Another way to say “I love you” is <em>te quiero</em>. Here’s where those degrees of affection come in. It literally means, “I want you,” but that’s a poor translation, in my opinion. This phrase doesn’t quite translate at all in English, because we have no equivalent at that degree. To say “I want you” in English has a lusty sound to it, and not very <em>romantic</em>. But in Spanish, a better translation is “I want you in my life.” It’s a step down from <em>te amo</em>, and usually said when you’re in a committed relationship, but not necessarily married (or at least, not yet).</p>
<p>And with both phrases, you can make them more passionate by adding <em>mucho</em> (“very much”). <em>Te amo mucho</em> or <em>te quiero mucho</em> both mean “I love you very much.”</p>
<p>A less direct way to express your love is to say <em>Significas mucho para mí</em>. This means “You mean so much to me.”</p>
<p>Here are a couple more ways to express romantic affection:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Me gustas</em>: “I like you”. The play-it-safe approach to expressing your affection in those early days of dating.</li>
<li><em>Me caes bien</em>: Also “I like you”. It’s a step down from <em>me gustas</em>, and more friendly.</li>
<li><em>Me encantas</em>: “I adore you” or “You enchant me”. It’s more romantic than <em>me gustas</em> and <em>me caes bien</em>, but it’s less serious than <em>te quiero</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about talking to family or friends? Usually, <em>te quiero</em> is for that kind of platonic love, or even affection for your pets. And if you’re wondering, “love” for things like objects or hobbies would be either <em>me gusta</em> (“I like”) or <em>me encanta</em> (“I’m enchanted by”, “I strongly like”).</p>
<h2 id="howtosaybeautifulinspanish">How to Say “Beautiful” in Spanish</h2>
<p>In Spanish, there are a <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/beautiful-spanish/">quite a few ways you can talk about someone’s beauty</a> or attractiveness. To say “beautiful” in Spanish, it’s <em>hermosa</em> or <em>hermoso</em>. This is the strongest way to say “beautiful” and it’s similar to “striking” or “gorgeous”. Because <em>hermosa</em> is so strong, it’s more common to use <em>bella</em> or <em>bello</em> (“beautiful” or “lovely”), though.To just say “beauty” as a noun, it’s <em>belleza</em>.</p>
<p>To call someone “pretty”, you use <em>bonita</em> or <em>bonito</em>. This is more casual, almost like saying “You look nice” instead of “You look beautiful”. It’s still a nice compliment, though, and can be used to talk about anything.</p>
<p>And to say someone is “handsome” or “attractive”, you say <em>guapo</em> or <em>guapa</em>. It’s more common to hear women called <em>bonita</em>, and men <em>guapo</em>. But, unlike English, these terms aren’t gender exclusive. Sometimes <em>guapo</em> is also used to say someone or something is “cool”.</p>
<p>In Latin America, it’s most common to describe someone’s beauty as <em>linda</em> or <em>lindo</em>, which means “lovely”.</p>
<h2 id="howtosaymyloveinspanish">How to Say “My Love” in Spanish</h2>
<p>To call someone “my love” in Spanish, you can say <em>mi amor</em>. But Spanish has a <em>lot</em> of <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/cute-nicknames/">cutesy and romantic nicknames</a> you could use instead. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mi vida</em>: “My life”</li>
<li><em>Mi sol</em>: “My sun”</li>
<li><em>Mi rey</em>: “My king”</li>
<li><em>Mi dulzura</em>: “My sweetness”</li>
<li><em>Mi querido</em>: “My dear”</li>
<li><em>Ojos de ángel</em>: “Angel eyes”</li>
</ul>
<p>You could also make them “cute” by adding the diminutive <em>-ito</em>. So <em>mi amor</em> could be <em>mi amorcito</em> (“my little love”). It can be used for anyone, but it’s most often used for children to add cuteness.</p>
<h2 id="howtosayyouremyotherhalfinspanish">How to Say “You’re My Other Half” in Spanish</h2>
<p>In Spanish, they have a sweet, unique phrase to tell someone “you’re my other half.” It’s <em>eres mi media naranja</em>, which translates as “you’re my half orange.” It’s best used for serious relationships, obviously, but it’s a cute and humorous way to say “my better half” like in English.</p>
<p>Why an orange? There are quite a few theories, but one explanation is that the dome of a church (<em>cúpula</em> or <em>cimborrio</em>) is also sometimes called <em>media naranja</em>. So it represents something beloved, a gift from heaven. Another theory is that every orange is different, and there can only be one perfect match for a half-orange. Either way, it’s a fun expression.</p>
<p>Because it’s used to say someone is your perfect match, it’s also used to say “my soulmate”. But you could also use <em>alma gemela</em> (“soulmate”). That’s just a heavier way to say it, while <em>media naranja</em> is lighthearted.</p>
<h2 id="howtosaymyheartinspanish">How to Say “My Heart” in Spanish</h2>
<p>Another romantic way to express your love is to call someone “my heart”, which is <em>mi corazón</em>. There are a few romantic phrases we can use this for, too:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tienes todo mi corazón</em>: “You have all my heart”</li>
<li><em>Mi corazón es tuyo</em>: “My heart is yours”</li>
<li><em>Te amo con todo mi corazón</em>: “I love you with all my heart”</li>
<li><em>Mi corazón late por ti</em>: “My heart beats for you”</li>
</ul>
<p>Talk about sparking some romance!</p>
<h2 id="howtosaymydarlinginspanish">How to Say “My Darling” in Spanish</h2>
<p>In English, there are so many nicknames we call our lovers: darling, dear, babe, sweetheart. We’ve talked about some of them so far, but here are some other common nicknames for your loved one.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cariño</em>: This is one of the most common nicknames you’ll hear. It has many different meanings: “sweetie”, “darling”, “dear”, “love”, “honey”, etc. It captures a lot of English nicknames in one.</li>
<li><em>Cielo</em>: It means “sky”, but it also translates as “heaven” or “paradise”. So you’re calling someone your own slice of heaven here on earth. It’s pretty romantic! Make it cuter with <em>mi cielito</em> (“my little heaven”).</li>
<li><em>Bebé</em>: “Baby” in Spanish, but essentially used the same as “babe” or “baby” in English when talking to your loved one. You could also use <em>nena</em> for “babe”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtosaysexyinspanish">How to Say “Sexy” in Spanish</h2>
<p>“Sexy” in Spanish is the same as it is in English: <em>sexy</em>. Although, you’ll see it written as <em>sexi</em> as well because it’s a better fit for Spanish pronunciation and spelling.</p>
<p>If you’re wanting to call someone “hot”, though, <strong>don’t use <em>caliente</em>!</strong> It doesn’t directly translate in Spanish. It’s used for hot food, yes, but when talking about a person? It means you’re horny, not “hot/sexy”. Instead, you can use the slang term <em>maciza</em> or <em>macizo</em>, which means “hot” in the same sense as English.</p>
<h2 id="howtosaycuteinspanish">How to Say “Cute” in Spanish</h2>
<p>“Cute” in Spanish doesn’t have <em>quite</em> the exact translation. But there are a few ways you could get the same idea across. <em>Rico</em> or <em>rica</em> is one way to say someone is “cute”, but it also means “sexy” or even “rich”. Sexy and cute don’t normally go together in English, but this word captures both.</p>
<p><em>Mono</em> and <em>mona</em> also mean “cute” as an adjective, like “nice-looking”.</p>
<p>And <em>linda</em> or <em>lindo</em>, which we covered earlier, can also mean “cute”. Even <em>listo</em> -- which means “ready”, “clever” or “prepared” -- can also be used for cute.</p>
<h2 id="howtosayicantlivewithoutyouinspanish">How to Say “I Can’t Live Without You” in Spanish</h2>
<p>Still looking for a different, special way to say how much you love someone? Here are some romantic phrases to express your love:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>No puedo vivir sin ti</em>: “I can’t live without you”</li>
<li><em>Te necesito</em>: “I need you”</li>
<li><em>Te echo de menos mi amor</em>: “I miss you, my love”</li>
<li><em>No puedo esperar a verte</em>: “I can’t wait to see you”</li>
<li><em>Estoy loco por ti</em>: “I’m crazy about you”</li>
<li><em>Quiero estar contigo para siempre</em>: “I want to be with you forever”</li>
<li><em>Estoy pensando en ti</em>: “I’m thinking of you”</li>
<li><em>Eres el amor de mi vida</em>: “You’re the love of my life”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtosayamazinginspanish">How to Say “Amazing” in Spanish</h2>
<p>There isn’t only one way to say “amazing” in Spanish -- there are a few words that work. You could use <em>increíble</em> (“incredible”), <em>asombroso</em> (“astounding”) or <em>maravilloso</em> (“marvellous”). All of them have similar meanings. So if you want to tell your loved one they’re amazing, say <em>Eres increíble!</em></p>
<p>And if you want to know how to talk about your feelings, the word in Spanish is <em>sentimientos</em> -- a “sentiment”. You could say <em>Tengo sentimientos por ti</em> (“I have feelings for you”) in Spanish, but it would sound a bit strange. <em>Sentimientos</em> is more general feelings, not just loved ones, so using <em>me encantas</em> would sound more natural.</p>
<p>If you want to express those <em>sentimientos</em> to other people though, these phrases will help:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Estoy enamorada</em> / <em>enamorado</em>: “I’m in love”</li>
<li><em>Estoy saliendo con alguien</em>: “I’m dating someone”</li>
<li><em>Amor verdadero</em>: “True love”</li>
<li><em>No puedo dejar de pensar en él / ella.</em>: “I can’t stop thinking about him/her.”</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you want to pop the big question in Spanish:<br />
<em>¿Te casarías conmigo?</em> (“Will you marry me?”)</p>
<h2 id="howwillyousayiloveyouinspanish">How Will You Say “I Love You” in Spanish?</h2>
<p>Which phrase will you use for your loved ones? Will you start calling your significant other <em>mi cielo</em>, or tell those you care about <em>te quiero</em>?</p>
<p>Are there any romantic words in Spanish that I missed? Leave me a comment and share it with me!</p>

Talk about sparking some romance!
<h2 id="howtosaymydarlinginspanish">How to Say “My Darling” in Spanish</h2>
In English, there are so many nicknames we call our lovers: darling, dear, babe, sweetheart. We’ve talked about some of them so far, but here are some other common nicknames for your loved one.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Cariño</em>: This is one of the most common nicknames you’ll hear. It has many different meanings: “sweetie”, “darling”, “dear”, “love”, “honey”, etc. It captures a lot of English nicknames in one.</li>
 	<li><em>Cielo</em>: It means “sky”, but it also translates as “heaven” or “paradise”. So you’re calling someone your own slice of heaven here on earth. It’s pretty romantic! Make it cuter with <em>mi cielito</em> (“my little heaven”).</li>
 	<li><em>Bebé</em>: “Baby” in Spanish, but essentially used the same as “babe” or “baby” in English when talking to your loved one. You could also use <em>nena</em> for “babe”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtosaysexyinspanish">How to Say “Sexy” in Spanish</h2>
“Sexy” in Spanish is the same as it is in English: <em>sexy</em>. Although, you’ll see it written as <em>sexi</em> as well because it’s a better fit for Spanish pronunciation and spelling.

If you’re wanting to call someone “hot”, though, <strong>don’t use <em>caliente</em>!</strong> It doesn’t directly translate in Spanish. It’s used for hot food, yes, but when talking about a person? It means you’re horny, not “hot/sexy”. Instead, you can use the slang term <em>maciza</em> or <em>macizo</em>, which means “hot” in the same sense as English.
<h2 id="howtosaycuteinspanish">How to Say “Cute” in Spanish</h2>
“Cute” in Spanish doesn’t have <em>quite</em> the exact translation. But there are a few ways you could get the same idea across. <em>Rico</em> or <em>rica</em> is one way to say someone is “cute”, but it also means “sexy” or even “rich”. Sexy and cute don’t normally go together in English, but this word captures both.

<em>Mono</em> and <em>mona</em> also mean “cute” as an adjective, like “nice-looking”.

And <em>linda</em> or <em>lindo</em>, which we covered earlier, can also mean “cute”. Even <em>listo</em> -- which means “ready”, “clever” or “prepared” -- can also be used for cute.
<h2 id="howtosayicantlivewithoutyouinspanish">How to Say “I Can’t Live Without You” in Spanish</h2>
Still looking for a different, special way to say how much you love someone? Here are some romantic phrases to express your love:
<ul>
 	<li><em>No puedo vivir sin ti</em>: “I can’t live without you”</li>
 	<li><em>Te necesito</em>: “I need you”</li>
 	<li><em>Te echo de menos mi amor</em>: “I miss you, my love”</li>
 	<li><em>No puedo esperar a verte</em>: “I can’t wait to see you”</li>
 	<li><em>Estoy loco por ti</em>: “I’m crazy about you”</li>
 	<li><em>Quiero estar contigo para siempre</em>: “I want to be with you forever”</li>
 	<li><em>Estoy pensando en ti</em>: “I’m thinking of you”</li>
 	<li><em>Eres el amor de mi vida</em>: “You’re the love of my life”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtosayamazinginspanish">How to Say “Amazing” in Spanish</h2>
There isn’t only one way to say “amazing” in Spanish -- there are a few words that work. You could use <em>increíble</em> (“incredible”), <em>asombroso</em> (“astounding”) or <em>maravilloso</em> (“marvellous”). All of them have similar meanings. So if you want to tell your loved one they’re amazing, say <em>Eres increíble!</em>

And if you want to know how to talk about your feelings, the word in Spanish is <em>sentimientos</em> -- a “sentiment”. You could say <em>Tengo sentimientos por ti</em> (“I have feelings for you”) in Spanish, but it would sound a bit strange. <em>Sentimientos</em> is more general feelings, not just loved ones, so using <em>me encantas</em> would sound more natural.

If you want to express those <em>sentimientos</em> to other people though, these phrases will help:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Estoy enamorada</em> / <em>enamorado</em>: “I’m in love”</li>
 	<li><em>Estoy saliendo con alguien</em>: “I’m dating someone”</li>
 	<li><em>Amor verdadero</em>: “True love”</li>
 	<li><em>No puedo dejar de pensar en él / ella.</em>: “I can’t stop thinking about him/her.”</li>
</ul>
And if you want to pop the big question in Spanish:
<em>¿Te casarías conmigo?</em> (“Will you marry me?”)
<h2 id="howwillyousayiloveyouinspanish">How Will You Say “I Love You” in Spanish?</h2>
Which phrase will you use for your loved ones? Will you start calling your significant other <em>mi cielo</em>, or tell those you care about <em>te quiero</em>?

<p>Here’s a question I often get from language learners about learning a new language in 90 days with <em>Add1</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What about a language like Chinese? Korean Or Thai? If I’m learning a language like that, can I do <em>Add1</em>?”</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who speaks Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Russian, I can understand where these questions are coming from.</p>
<p>Languages like <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/korean/">Korean</a>, <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/learn-russian/">Russian</a>, <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/mandarin-chinese-is-easy/">Chinese</a>, <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/easy-japanese/">Japanese</a>, and <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/reading-thai-tones-is-easy/">Thai</a> often get a bad rap as “difficult” languages.</p>
<p>Can you <em>really</em> get the same results in 90 days with a difficult language as you can with an “easier” language like French, German, or Italian?</p>
<p>Actually, yes.</p>
<p>I’ve watched hundreds of learners of these languages do it. And I have even done it myself with Korean and Japanese. But don’t take my word for it. Here are excerpts of an interview I did with Randal Rhoade, an <em>Add1</em> student who took on Thai.</p>
<h2 id="learningthaitoconversationallevelin90dayswithadd1">Learning Thai to Conversational Level in 90 Days with <em>Add1</em></h2>
<p>Randal Rhoade: Hello everyone. My name is Randal. I am currently living in Bangkok, and I learned Thai because I just got a new job and I was moving to Bangkok from Lao.</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Kennedy: What drew you to the <em>Add1</em>Challenge?</strong></p>
<p>RR: I had been frustrated with learning Lao [a language spoken in Laos], and it was very difficult to find some teachers who were adequate. So I started searching online to see what was available. I never thought to go online as a resource. Then I started seeing this community out there, and Benny and the <em>Add1</em>Challenge... so I just started. I love to challenge myself on my own, and I thought this was a good opportunity to do a challenge with a community.</p>
<h2 id="watchrandalsprogressfromday0today90">Watch Randal’s Progress from Day 0 to Day 90</h2>
<p>httpvh://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTw4SFsyMqs</p>
<h2 id="howrandalsucceededandlearnedthaiin90days">How Randal Succeeded and Learned Thai in 90 Days</h2>
<p><strong>SK: When you started the challenge what were your initial plans? What did you think you would be doing to study the language?</strong></p>
<p>RR: I had fortunately already made contact with a tutor, a <a href="http://fluentin3months.com/italki">Thai tutor</a>, and it was great timing that we just started lessons the week that the challenge started. Tutoring with her became the fundamental aspect of my training.</p>
<p><strong>SK: What was your weekly study commitment? How many days per week did you study, and how many minutes?</strong></p>
<p>RR: Because I was working full time, which is more than normal hours, I wasn't sure at first, but I had committed to 45 minutes, 5, 6 days a week, I believe. I was very determined to learn Thai, because I wasn't learning Lao very easily.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love to challenge myself on my own, and I thought this was a good opportunity to do a challenge with a community.</p></blockquote>
<p>I ended up doing well over an hour a day. I had determined what worked well early in the morning, and then what I could do during lunch hour, for example, and then my heaviest study times were usually in the evening.</p>
<p>My commute to work would be listening to audio. <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/pimsleur/">Pimsleur</a> was what seemed to be the easiest because it was an audio recording, they're very short excerpts, and it had me actually speaking, not just working something through my mind. I would actually have to verbalize what they would be saying on the audio.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just do enough to make you feel excited about learning more tomorrow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then lunchtime, sometimes I would have flashcards or I would just start practicing a word that I had learned for the day, and then the evening was much more studious lecture-type study. Writing the words, trying to learn the vocabulary, and sentence structure.</p>
<h2 id="randalstopresourcesforlearningthai">Randal’s Top Resources for Learning Thai</h2>
<p><strong>SK: As far as what other specific resources you found helpful to you in the challenge, what would those be?</strong></p>
<p>RR: The <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/find-language-tutor/">tutor became the core investment</a>. Then I purchased Pimsleur, and then I purchased a few books.</p>
<h2 id="howrandalbrokethroughhisanxietytospeakthaionvideo">How Randal Broke Through His Anxiety to Speak Thai on Video</h2>
<p><em>Note: For *Add1</em>, students create videos of themselves speaking their target language on Day 0, 30, 60 and 90. The Day 90 video is a recording of them having a 15 minute conversation with a native speaker.*</p>
<p><strong>SK: Tell me about how you approached making the videos. What your feelings were going into making them, and what your feelings were after you had made them.</strong></p>
<p>RR: Initially I was anxious and nervous, and what worked for me is meditation. I try to incorporate that into my daily life, so I just relaxed. I would be nervous and then I would work myself through a relaxation period, and then became comfortable with just focusing on what I was able to speak.</p>
<p>I just determined, in my mind, that I'm not performing for anyone. [The videos are] an exercise just to indicate your progress, and it should be more celebratory than anything, because you should always be better than you were before and introducing new vocabulary. I would just relax, and then most of the time I was quite spontaneous. I didn't want anything too scripted. I would make sure I was familiar with the subject and the words I was going to use, just run it through my mind, and then I just would record.</p>
<h2 id="randalsobstaclesinlearningthaiandhowheovercamethem">Randal’s Obstacles in Learning Thai -- And How He Overcame Them</h2>
<p><strong>SK: What about any obstacles you might have faced during the challenge. Did you have anything like that come up during the challenge, and if it did, how did you overcome it?</strong></p>
<p>RR: I had to travel twice around the world, going back to the US, which is a long haul. I prepared some materials that I knew I would be able to handle on the plane. I just did some preparation I knew I couldn't push myself too much because it's very tiresome to travel that far, and that long.</p>
<blockquote><p>I knew I couldn't push myself too much because it's very tiresome to travel that far, and that long.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the biggest challenge to that was taking a break. I became quite determined, and I was thinking of taking a break. It was hard for me to actually take the break because I was just so persistent and determined to do the best I could with this experience.</p>
<p><strong>SK: Did you end up taking your break, or did you end up pushing through and studying anyways?</strong></p>
<p>RR: Over the 90 days I think I took three days off. I didn't do any study, and I realized I was about three weeks into the challenge before I decided to take my first break. I didn't really feel like I needed it because I was excited.</p>
<p>There was a quote that I saw in the beginning of the challenge that someone posted and I thought it was really neat. It was the saying, it said "Do enough to make you excited to do more tomorrow."</p>
<p>If you have work, and you have a family, and you have other demands, it's very difficult to do it any faster than just in small increments.</p>
<h2 id="randals15minuteconversationinthaiafter90days">Randal’s 15-Minute Conversation in Thai after 90 Days</h2>
<p><strong>SK: Let's talk about your 90 day video. How did you feel going into your video? What did you expect? Were you worried about making it to the 15 minutes? Were you confident that you were going to make it to the 15 minutes? How did it go?</strong></p>
<p>RR: Yes, I was concerned. This was the big one and I had been frustrated with myself the whole process, because this has been a very difficult language for me.</p>
<p>I was using a few <a href="http://fluentin3months.com/italki-review">italki teachers</a> to speak more frequently, and I just let the teacher know beforehand, this is roughly my vocabulary levels, these are the subjects I can speak about, if we can keep the conversation around this particular subject that I would stand a better chance at reaching 15 minutes. Because the conversations can go off into different directions and you're not really prepared with the vocabulary. To go from zero to 15 minutes within 90 days, you need to focus.</p>
<p><strong>SK: What were some of these specific subjects that you prepared, that you were working on during the challenge that you felt comfortable discussing during your 90 day video?</strong></p>
<p>RR: Some of the subjects were my free time, interactions I would have with people in the street, food, taking a taxi, what are my daily routines. That was a big part of the conversation. What do I do on a daily basis?</p>
<h2 id="randalsbiggesttakeawayfromadd1">Randal’s Biggest Takeaway from <em>Add1</em></h2>
<p><em>*SK: What would you say your biggest takeaway was from the *Add1</em>Challenge?*</p>
<p>RR: Focusing on small wins is really what this helped me. If you open a book for example, and you just have all this vocabulary, it really doesn't mean anything to you, or to me. It's gotta be relevant.</p>
<h2 id="randalsadvicetofutureadd1students">Randal’s Advice to Future <em>Add1</em> Students</h2>
<p><strong>SK: If you have advice to someone just starting the <em>Add1</em>Challenge now, what would that be?</strong></p>
<p>RR: <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/find-language-tutor/">Get a tutor</a>. I would invest in a tutor.</p>
<p>Being part of the community of people who are also interested in doing something similar was also motivating. Winning or not, being focused, having that accountability, and having a team leader who was sending out encouraging notes, sending out guidelines, you were very responsive with emails and questions about the challenge. I think it was a very worthwhile investment if you're serious about learning a language.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a very worthwhile investment if you're serious about learning a language.</p></blockquote>
<p>The challenge is a great place to start to get the motivation and keep the motivation with accountability.</p>

Being part of the community of people who are also interested in doing something similar was also motivating. Winning or not, being focused, having that accountability, and having a team leader who was sending out encouraging notes, sending out guidelines, you were very responsive with emails and questions about the challenge. I think it was a very worthwhile investment if you're serious about learning a language.

The challenge is a great place to start to get the motivation and keep the motivation with accountability.

<p>Today I’m doing a review of Amikumu, which is an app for language learners. I’ll share what I liked about Amikumu, and what could be better. I want to help you decide if it’s right for you.</p>
<p>Now, many of us language learners like to travel. We travel to see new things, get an inside view of the local culture, and to practice the languages we’re learning.</p>
<p>But where do you go if the language you’re learning doesn’t have a place where it’s spoken? A language like Esperanto?</p>
<p>The answer?</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>I’ll touch on this more in a moment...</p>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re probably wondering where to find <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/language-exchange/">language exchange partners</a> and what the best platforms are. You’ve probably tried at least one in the past.</p>
<p>I’ve signed up for more than a few language exchange platforms since I started learning languages on my own. And there’s one thing that I’ve learned:</p>
<p><em>The platform itself may have a lot of useful features that make it easy to use, but the value of a language exchange platform is in its members.</em></p>
<p>Are the other members active? Do they speak your target language? Are they responsive to messages? Do they want to help other members as much as they want to be helped? All of these are questions to ask about the community on a language exchange platform.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25768" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-userprofile.png" alt="" width="373" height="663" /></p>
<h2 id="whatisamikumu">What is Amikumu?</h2>
<p>“Do the friend thing.” That’s what “amikumu” means in Esperanto and it’s a true description of just what this tool helps you do.</p>
<p><a href="https://amikumu.com/"><em>Amikumu</em></a> is a language exchange app and social network that helps you find language practice partners geographically close to you. It was originally designed to connect Esperanto speakers, but it now supports the world's 7,000+ languages, including 100+ sign languages.</p>
<p>The brainchild of Richard Delamore and Chuck Smith, the app first launched in 2017. Today, it has <a href="https://amikumu.com/statistics/">members from nearly 200 countries</a> and it continues to grow.</p>
<h2 id="gettingstartedwithamikumu">Getting Started with Amikumu</h2>
<p>After downloading <a href="https://amikumu.com/"><em>Amikumu</em></a> to your mobile device, setting up your account is easy and free. Upon opening the app, you’re asked to select an interface language. This is the language the app will be in, so bonus points if you select a language you’re learning. It’s one quick way to create immersion at home.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25761" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-language-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>From there, you have the option to log in or register. When you choose to register, a popup appears on your screen reminding you that any information you share in your profile is public and visible by the <em>Amikumu</em> community. Because you’re sharing your location, this is particularly important to note. For your safety, it’s important to be very selective of the information you share and the fact that <em>Amikumu</em> reminds you of this is definitely a good thing. It’s also worth noting that <em>Amikumu</em> does not show your exact location nor store it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25762" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-warning-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>From there you enter your name, email, date of birth, and a password to create your account. Accept the terms and conditions and then tap “sign up.” And don’t worry -- your birthdate isn’t visible on your profile unless you opt for it to be!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25763" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-register-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25764" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-setup-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>That’s it! You’re in.</p>
<p>Now that you’re in, how do you use this social app?</p>
<p><em>Amikumu</em> has a few different ways you can engage with the app. The first is called “Flow”. This is essentially the social feed, showing updates from those closest to you who speak your selected language. Members can post questions or update their status and you can comment or “heart” anything displayed in your feed. It’s a great place to get to know the other people using <em>Amikumu</em> in a public forum before moving your chat to a private 1-on-1.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25765" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-flow-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>The next option is “Nearby” and it’s where you can find other language learners near you. They’re organized by distance from you. If you’d like to search from a different location -- for example, if you wanted to arrange to meet up with someone on an upcoming trip -- there’s a location button up in the top left corner. If you’d like to change which language you’re looking to practice, there’s a small icon up in the top right corner you can use to change languages.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25769" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-nearby.png" alt="" width="497" height="883" /></p>
<p>The third tab is where you’ll find the conversations you’ve started with other <em>Amikumu</em> members. They’re organized with the most recent at the top. Much like other chat platforms, <em>Amikumu</em> shows you a single checkmark when your message is sent and a double checkmark when your message is read.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25766" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-messages-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>And finally, the fourth tab is where you’ll find your profile and app settings. Here you can adjust your notifications, choose what information is shown on your profile, select your languages, and more. You can also choose to hide your profile so that other users cannot find and contact you if you prefer to make initial contact.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25767" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/amikumu-profile-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" /></p>
<p>When editing your profile, you can create a separate profile for each of your languages. This is useful in a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your expertise in each language may be slightly different</strong>, so you can create a bio that notes this. For example, I’m much better at talking about music in Japanese than Hungarian, but better at talking about tech in Hungarian than Japanese. By having separate profiles for each language, I can share what I like to talk about, what I’m good at talking about and what I’d like to improve in each language.</li>
<li><strong>You can practice writing in each language.</strong> By writing a bio in each language, you get the chance to practice your writing and very me-specific vocabulary. Plus, other members who speak your language may offer corrections if you need them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="myexperienceusingamikumuthegood">My Experience Using Amikumu: The Good</h2>
<p><em>Amikumu</em> is a fun way to chat with other people who share your passion for language learning. You can find other members both near and far with knowledge of tons of different languages. You can choose to meet up with other learners in person or keep your conversation in the app -- it’s flexible for you to use as you see fit.</p>
<p>And although I do not yet have any personal experience in this scenario, I’ve also heard that the app is an amazing tool to have on hand when attending language events like LangFest, the Polyglot Gathering or the Polyglot Conference. This is because it helps you connect with others who know your languages, something that can be surprisingly difficult to do even at a language event! You even get a badge added to your profile when you use the app at an event. I started using <em>Amikumu</em> just a few months after attending my last LangFest, so I’m a bit bummed I missed earning the badge!</p>
<p>But the badges aren’t just a way to spruce up your profile, they’re great conversation starters, too. How so? When I see someone who has a badge for an event that I’ve been to, that initial message is easy: “Hey, I saw you were at LangFest last year. I was, too! What was your favorite talk?” And even when I see a badge for an event that I haven’t been to, I can ask: “I see you went to the Polyglot Conference. I couldn’t make it this year. How was it?” In your new language, of course.</p>
<p>I also really liked that there was a public social feed. It gave me a place to test the waters contacting active members without having to create private 1-on-1 conversations right away. Plus, it gave me the ability to interact with more than one person at once, getting more language input from multiple speakers.</p>
<p>Finally, I mentioned earlier that the value of a language exchange platform is in its members. I found that the people I connected with using Amikumu responded well, and they seemed like engaged, motivated language learners (this isn’t true for all language exchange platforms). I even found some folks from our 90-day language program, <a href="https://add1challenge.com">Add1</a>!</p>
<p>There were some issues though…</p>
<h2 id="myexperienceusingamikumuwhatcouldbebetter">My Experience Using Amikumu: What Could Be Better?</h2>
<p><em>Amikumu</em> is designed to help language learners not just connect on the app, but in-person. Unfortunately, for the languages I speak or am learning, there wasn’t anyone I could meet with face-to-face in my area (Southern California). That isn’t to say that there aren’t people in my area on the app. In fact, there were several. The majority, however, were Esperanto learners and speakers. A language that I don’t speak and am not currently learning.</p>
<p>Because the app was originally designed and marketed to the Esperanto community, the majority of their users (at least in my area) are a part of that demographic. If you’re an Esperanto speaker, this is fantastic. If you’re not, you may need to wait until more people begin using the platform to find someone who speaks your language(s) in your area. In the meantime, you can enjoy the chat feature and reach out to those who speak your language regardless of location.</p>
<p><em>Amikumu</em> also requires that you have location turned on your phone in order to work. So if you just wanted to pop on to chat with other members in your languages without sharing your location, you’re not able to do so. If privacy is a major concern for you, this may be a dealbreaker.</p>
<h2 id="willikeepusingamikumu">Will I Keep Using Amikumu?</h2>
<p><em>Amikumu</em> has the potential to be an excellent app whether you’re looking to practice a language or connect with fellow language lovers in your area. The only way that can happen is if its user base continues to grow. It’s designed by language learners for language learners, so the developers are attuned to your needs in order to continue to build <em>Amikumu</em> into an even better social language learning app than it already is.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that <em>Amikumu</em> will not teach you a language. Instead, it’s a platform where you can practice the language you’re studying with other tools and resources.</p>
<p>At this time, I would give Amikumu 3 stars, but once it grows and membership increases, I would increase this to 4 stars without hesitation.</p>

At this time, I would give Amikumu 3 stars, but once it grows and membership increases, I would increase this to 4 stars without hesitation.

You can download <a href="https://amikumu.com/">Amikumu for iOS or Android devices</a>.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/amikumu-review/">Amikumu Review: Will You Find Language Learners in Your Area?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fluentin3months.com">Fluent in 3 months - Language Hacking and Travel Tips</a>.</p>

<p>After hearing her speak at <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/women-in-language/">Women In Language</a>, I knew that I had to interview Nikki Prša for our new <em>Language Mentors</em> series.</p>

<h2 id="whatarethetopthreeactivitiesyouwouldadvisetohavea15minuteconversationinanewlanguageafter90days">What Are the Top Three Activities You Would Advise to Have a 15 Minute Conversation in a New Language after 90 Days??</h2>
<p>This goal is <strong>absolutely attainable.</strong> I would recommend doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen to music in your target language.</strong> Look up the lyrics. Translate them (on your own) into your native language. Mark any useful phrases. Add them to a list in your notebook or your phone. Try to use them in conversation immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Take group classes or individual lessons online or in person.</strong> This way, you will have someone to practice with and are able to ask any questions you may have.</li>
<li><strong>Be brave and try to communicate with others!</strong> If you have no one to talk to, record yourself and post on social media. You can converse with other speakers of your target language online. It is great to see and hear your progress in the language you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatarethetopthreeroadblocksyouseelearnersface">What Are the Top Three Roadblocks You See Learners Face?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Insecurity (especially when learners are not speaking the language enough to make progress)</li>
<li>Getting stuck and giving up</li>
<li>Lack of time which often leads to lack of motivation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreekeysfordealingwiththoseroadblocks">What Are Your Top Three Keys for Dealing with Those Roadblocks?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A lot of people study the written language and lack the confidence they need to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/">try to speak the language</a>. It can be hard when you try to say something in another language and the other person does not understand you. It’s a blow to your confidence. You can be bummed for a little bit, but try to get over it. <strong>Move on quickly and try again!</strong> Everyone makes mistakes. The only way to get better is to keep going.</li>
<li>Sometimes people get stuck on a certain grammar point. For example, they cannot figure out how to say things in the future. They may give up on trying to learn the language. <strong>Try to figure out another way to look at the topic</strong>. Watch another explanation on YouTube. DM a native speaker of your target language on Instagram or Twitter and ask them for help. Or take part in a language exchange or online/in person class. Hearing as much of the language as possible can help your speaking skills as much as your listening skills.</li>
<li>If you find you don’t have enough time or you’re not feeling motivated to study, <strong>discover the way you learn best.</strong> You may not be the online language app type. You may need to do something in person to have fun with language learning. If you like watching TV or movies, watch something you’ve seen before in your target language! It’ll be entertaining and educational. You can do a quick lesson on Memrise or DuoLingo](https://www.fluentin3months.com/duolingo/). Or go through your list of phrases on your phone or in your notebook to review what you already know. If I ever feel stuck, my favorite thing to do is take a song in English and translate it into the target language. It can be so silly but it is a blast to figure out how to sing “Party in the USA” in Croatian. I get a kick out of trying to get the words to match up to the melody.</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id="attachment_26165" align="aligncenter" width="848"]<img class="wp-image-26165 size-large" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nikki_New_Mexico-848x1024.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="1024" /> Sometimes, you just have to soak up nature like here in Santa Fe, New Mexico.[/caption]</p>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreefavoritememoriesofalanguagewin">What Are Your Top Three Favorite Memories of a Language Win?</h2>
<p>It is so hard to pick three!</p>
<ul>
<li>Riding in taxis in Cairo and <strong>surprising the driver by speaking Egyptian Arabic</strong></li>
<li><strong>When people think I’m a native speaker</strong> of any of my target languages</li>
<li><strong>Appearing in a segment</strong> on <a href="https://youtu.be/sALbLFhhHWQ">Good Morning Croatia</a>. I spoke in Croatian about my company. I was visiting my in-laws in Croatia. And I had a feeling that I could make it happen. I reached out to the show to see if they’d be interested. They were. It was so fun!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreefavoriteplacestopracticespeakingatargetlanguage">What Are Your Top Three Favorite Places to Practice Speaking a Target Language?</h2>
<ul>
<li>At a <strong>language meetup</strong> at the [insert language here] Society of the town where you live. For example, there is a German Society of Philadelphia that has regular meetings. You can also find a language exchange from Meetup.com in your area.</li>
<li>In the country or place where they speak the language I am learning. I adore a good <strong>immersion experience</strong>.</li>
<li>On Facetime with friends and family who speak that language! <strong>The internet is amazing</strong>. I relish being able to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/how-to-find-a-language-exchange-partner/">communicate easily with people all over the world</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id="attachment_26166" align="aligncenter" width="604"]<img class="wp-image-26166 size-full" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nikki_Egypt.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="453" /> Cairo, Egypt: I lucky to have met many incredible people. We studied Arabic for 8 hours a day and then went out to practice speaking Egyptian colloquial Arabic in the real life situations.[/caption]</p>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreefavoritecities">What Are Your Top Three Favorite Cities?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mošćenička Draga isn’t a city but rather a small town on the Croatian coast. I love <strong>the seaside in Croatia</strong>! It is beautiful and clean. The sea helps me to recharge my batteries.</li>
<li>Paris, France is all about food, language, and exploring this gorgeous city on foot. You can’t help but <strong>feel the romance</strong> when you are in this dreamy metropolis.</li>
<li>San Diego, USA offers amazing weather. You can <strong>explore the outdoors</strong> in the most entertaining ways! Seeing all the seals chillin’ out in nearby La Jolla. Taking an adventurous yoga class. Discovering the Italian market downtown and all the goodies from nearby Mexico.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatarethetopthreebiggestchallengesyoufaceinyourtargetlanguage">What Are the Top Three Biggest Challenges You Face in Your Target Language?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grammar in general can be difficult. Especially <strong>remembering different case endings</strong> when you are speaking in another language</li>
<li>When I speak a lot of one language for a while, it can be <strong>hard to remember</strong> a simple word in another language. When my in-laws were visiting from Croatia, I was speaking so much Croatian. I then went to an event where I had to speak <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/german-learning-resources/">German</a> all the time. I kept wanting to say <em>opet</em> “again” in Croation instead of <em>wieder</em> “again” in German!</li>
<li>Arabic is a beautiful but difficult language for me. <strong>If I don’t use it, I lose it</strong>. I have to practice a little bit every day. It is challenging for me to put myself out of my comfort zone and record myself speaking Arabic. When I was taking classes regularly, I was much better. I would come up with freestyle raps in Arabic!</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id="attachment_26167" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<img class="wp-image-26167 size-full" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nikki_Bavaria.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="512" /> Representing Bavaria, Germany at a recent international conference in Philadelphia, USA. Just call me Frau![/caption]</p>
<h2 id="howdoyouworkonthesechallenges">How Do You Work on These Challenges?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I read <strong>multiple textbooks</strong> and do a variety of written exercises to work on grammar. I also use my list of phrases that I keep in my notebook or phone to review grammar patterns in the spoken language. I listen to native speakers. When I hear something new, I make a note of it to figure out what it means.</li>
<li>The more you speak your target language, the more comfortable you will feel! I practice <strong><a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/">speaking the language as much as I can</a></strong>. Everyone makes <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/mistakes-matter/">mistakes</a>. I will get better if I speak with more native speakers.</li>
<li>I just do it. <strong>I make myself practice</strong>. I am not a big fan of preparing what I am going to say before I record a video of myself but I know that can help a lot of people. I used to read a lot in Arabic and translate to English. A big tip I can give for studying Arabic is do not transliterate! Learn the alphabet. Once comfortable with the alphabet, Arabic is just like learning any other language.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreepearlsofwisdomforlanguagelearners">What Are Your Top Three Pearls of Wisdom for Language Learners?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combine your other hobbies with language learning</strong>. I love to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dancing-painting-cooking/">cook</a>. I enjoy looking up recipes from different countries in different languages. I also watch YouTube videos and cooking shows in different languages. I learn how to prepare a dish from another culture. Make sure you are having a good time! If you are enjoying yourself, you’ll want to continue.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/confidence/">Do not be shy</a>. You have to try in order to get better. Being quiet won’t get you to the next level. <strong>Be brave and practice</strong>. If you hear someone speaking the language, at least say hello! You might be able to get a little speaking practice in - or you may even make a new friend!</li>
<li><strong>Learn phrases instead of single words</strong>. Once you have a few phrases under your belt, you can learn more individual words. Always learn the gender along with the word if the language uses genders. Learn phrases so you can have a conversation as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ifyouweregoingtotrythefi3mchallengewhatarethetopthreelanguagesyoumightattempttolearn">If You Were Going to Try the <em>Fi3M Challenge</em>, What Are the Top Three Languages You Might Attempt to Learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have always found <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/french-learning-resources/">French</a> delightful and only know the basics. I’ve wanted to dedicate more time to it but I haven’t found the right teacher yet. So I’ve just been dabbling on my own.</li>
<li>People assume I speak <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spanish-learning-resources/">Spanish</a> because I live in the U.S. I know a lot of random words and phrases. But I would need to focus for a few months so I could become properly conversational.</li>
<li>I enjoy a good language challenge. There is no better feeling than delighting someone by speaking their native tongue. When I do share the few words I know in <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/chinese-learning-resources/">Mandarin</a> to someone I meet, they are so excited. It makes me want to learn more so I can communicate further!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreeguiltypleasureswhenlearningalanguage">What Are Your Top Three Guilty Pleasures When Learning a Language?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scream singing 80s/90s <strong>Croatian pop music</strong>. It reminds me of being at a wedding in Croatia.</li>
<li><strong>Disco Polo</strong>. Polish people know what this is.</li>
<li><strong>Reality TV shows</strong> from other countries. You can learn a lot of conversational phrases from reality shows. They show real life conversations between the contestants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreetipsforstartingtolearnanotherlanguage">What Are Your Top Three Tips for Starting to Learn Another Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>When I was younger, I first learned to count to ten, say “I love you”, and <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/basic-phrases/">basic greetings in 20 languages</a>. I was bold and just asked people who spoke the language how to say certain things. You never know when something you learn and tuck away in your brain might come in handy. In one very important case, a Croatian guy was hired at the restaurant that I worked at in college. I was excited to meet him and tried to think of anything I knew about Croatia. I remembered from back in the AIM days, a friend would write <em>Volim te</em> to his Croatian girlfriend as an away message. As I met the new guy at the restaurant, I said <em>Volim te</em> since it was the only thing I knew how to say. If you don’t know - that means “I love you.” He responded to me in Croatian but I told him that was the only thing I knew in his language. We totally hit it off...and <strong>that guy eventually became my husband</strong>. &#x2764;</li>
<li>Go to your <strong>local library</strong> and get a book, DVD or something that you can bring home to begin to study the language. Take notes while you are going through the materials in a notebook. It helps you remember things more when you write it down by hand.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for help</strong> when you need it. <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/find-language-tutor/">Hire a teacher</a> through an online school or from a local school. If things aren’t working with your current teacher, get another one. If you can’t afford to pay for lessons, get onto a Facebook group. There are so many! You can connect with speakers of your target language and learn something new.</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id="attachment_26168" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-26168 size-large" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nikki_Pennsylvania-1024x678.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" /> My husband, Tomislav and baby boy, Gulliver at his baptism. We speak a mix of languages at home and hope that Gully will like languages as much as we do![/caption]</p>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreetipsforstartingaconversationwithastrangerinyourtargetlanguage">What Are Your Top Three Tips for Starting a Conversation with a Stranger in Your Target Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>Greet them! Consider their culture. In the States, people are very friendly and say “How are you” as a greeting rather than wanting to know what is going on with you. If you’re talking to someone from Eastern Europe, <strong>a “hello” will do just fine</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Discuss a topic that could go in many directions</strong>. Travel is always a good one that won’t offend anyone.</li>
<li>If you don’t know what else to say, <strong>ask for directions or a recommendation</strong>! Ask the person if they know how to get to a certain place. Ask if they have any tips for you to learn their language. Or ask if they have a favorite food that you should try.</li>
</ul>

They may give up on trying to learn the language. <strong>Try to figure out another way to look at the topic</strong>. Watch another explanation on YouTube. DM a native speaker of your target language on Instagram or Twitter and ask them for help. Or take part in a language exchange or online/in person class. Hearing as much of the language as possible can help your speaking skills as much as your listening skills.</li>
 	<li>If you find you don’t have enough time or you’re not feeling motivated to study, <strong>discover the way you learn best.</strong> You may not be the online language app type. You may need to do something in person to have fun with language learning. If you like watching TV or movies, watch something you’ve seen before in your target language! It’ll be entertaining and educational. You can do a quick lesson on Memrise or DuoLingo](https://www.fluentin3months.com/duolingo/). Or go through your list of phrases on your phone or in your notebook to review what you already know. If I ever feel stuck, my favorite thing to do is take a song in English and translate it into the target language. It can be so silly but it is a blast to figure out how to sing “Party in the USA” in Croatian. I get a kick out of trying to get the words to match up to the melody.</li>

It is so hard to pick three!
<ul>
 	<li>Riding in taxis in Cairo and <strong>surprising the driver by speaking Egyptian Arabic</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>When people think I’m a native speaker</strong> of any of my target languages</li>
 	<li><strong>Appearing in a segment</strong> on <a href="https://youtu.be/sALbLFhhHWQ">Good Morning Croatia</a>. I spoke in Croatian about my company. I was visiting my in-laws in Croatia. And I had a feeling that I could make it happen. I reached out to the show to see if they’d be interested. They were. It was so fun!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreefavoriteplacestopracticespeakingatargetlanguage">What Are Your Top Three Favorite Places to Practice Speaking a Target Language?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>At a <strong>language meetup</strong> at the [insert language here] Society of the town where you live. For example, there is a German Society of Philadelphia that has regular meetings. You can also find a language exchange from Meetup.com in your area.</li>
 	<li>In the country or place where they speak the language I am learning. I adore a good <strong>immersion experience</strong>.</li>
 	<li>On Facetime with friends and family who speak that language! <strong>The internet is amazing</strong>. I relish being able to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/how-to-find-a-language-exchange-partner/">communicate easily with people all over the world</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreefavoritecities">What Are Your Top Three Favorite Cities?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Mošćenička Draga isn’t a city but rather a small town on the Croatian coast. I love <strong>the seaside in Croatia</strong>! It is beautiful and clean. The sea helps me to recharge my batteries.</li>
 	<li>Paris, France is all about food, language, and exploring this gorgeous city on foot. You can’t help but <strong>feel the romance</strong> when you are in this dreamy metropolis.</li>
 	<li>San Diego, USA offers amazing weather. You can <strong>explore the outdoors</strong> in the most entertaining ways! Seeing all the seals chillin’ out in nearby La Jolla. Taking an adventurous yoga class. Discovering the Italian market downtown and all the goodies from nearby Mexico.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatarethetopthreebiggestchallengesyoufaceinyourtargetlanguage">What Are the Top Three Biggest Challenges You Face in Your Target Language?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Grammar in general can be difficult. Especially <strong>remembering different case endings</strong> when you are speaking in another language</li>
 	<li>When I speak a lot of one language for a while, it can be <strong>hard to remember</strong> a simple word in another language. When my in-laws were visiting from Croatia, I was speaking so much Croatian. I then went to an event where I had to speak <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/german-learning-resources/">German</a> all the time. I kept wanting to say <em>opet</em> “again” in Croation instead of <em>wieder</em> “again” in German!</li>
 	<li>Arabic is a beautiful but difficult language for me. <strong>If I don’t use it, I lose it</strong>. I have to practice a little bit every day. It is challenging for me to put myself out of my comfort zone and record myself speaking Arabic. When I was taking classes regularly, I was much better. I would come up with freestyle raps in Arabic!</li>
</ul>
[caption id="attachment_26167" align="aligncenter" width="400"]<img class="wp-image-26167 size-full" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nikki_Bavaria.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="512" /> Representing Bavaria, Germany at a recent international conference in Philadelphia, USA. Just call me Frau![/caption]
<h2 id="howdoyouworkonthesechallenges">How Do You Work on These Challenges?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>I read <strong>multiple textbooks</strong> and do a variety of written exercises to work on grammar. I also use my list of phrases that I keep in my notebook or phone to review grammar patterns in the spoken language. I listen to native speakers. When I hear something new, I make a note of it to figure out what it means.</li>
 	<li>The more you speak your target language, the more comfortable you will feel! I practice <strong><a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/">speaking the language as much as I can</a></strong>. Everyone makes <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/mistakes-matter/">mistakes</a>. I will get better if I speak with more native speakers.</li>
 	<li>I just do it. <strong>I make myself practice</strong>. I am not a big fan of preparing what I am going to say before I record a video of myself but I know that can help a lot of people. I used to read a lot in Arabic and translate to English. A big tip I can give for studying Arabic is do not transliterate! Learn the alphabet. Once comfortable with the alphabet, Arabic is just like learning any other language.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreepearlsofwisdomforlanguagelearners">What Are Your Top Three Pearls of Wisdom for Language Learners?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Combine your other hobbies with language learning</strong>. I love to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dancing-painting-cooking/">cook</a>. I enjoy looking up recipes from different countries in different languages. I also watch YouTube videos and cooking shows in different languages. I learn how to prepare a dish from another culture. Make sure you are having a good time! If you are enjoying yourself, you’ll want to continue.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/confidence/">Do not be shy</a>. You have to try in order to get better. Being quiet won’t get you to the next level. <strong>Be brave and practice</strong>. If you hear someone speaking the language, at least say hello! You might be able to get a little speaking practice in - or you may even make a new friend!</li>
 	<li><strong>Learn phrases instead of single words</strong>. Once you have a few phrases under your belt, you can learn more individual words. Always learn the gender along with the word if the language uses genders. Learn phrases so you can have a conversation as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ifyouweregoingtotrythefi3mchallengewhatarethetopthreelanguagesyoumightattempttolearn">If You Were Going to Try the <em>Fi3M Challenge</em>, What Are the Top Three Languages You Might Attempt to Learn?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>I have always found <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/french-learning-resources/">French</a> delightful and only know the basics. I’ve wanted to dedicate more time to it but I haven’t found the right teacher yet. So I’ve just been dabbling on my own.</li>
 	<li>People assume I speak <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spanish-learning-resources/">Spanish</a> because I live in the U.S. I know a lot of random words and phrases. But I would need to focus for a few months so I could become properly conversational.</li>
 	<li>I enjoy a good language challenge. There is no better feeling than delighting someone by speaking their native tongue. When I do share the few words I know in <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/chinese-learning-resources/">Mandarin</a> to someone I meet, they are so excited. It makes me want to learn more so I can communicate further!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreeguiltypleasureswhenlearningalanguage">What Are Your Top Three Guilty Pleasures When Learning a Language?</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Scream singing 80s/90s <strong>Croatian pop music</strong>. It reminds me of being at a wedding in Croatia.</li>
 	<li><strong>Disco Polo</strong>. Polish people know what this is.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reality TV shows</strong> from other countries. You can learn a lot of conversational phrases from reality shows. They show real life conversations between the contestants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreetipsforstartingtolearnanotherlanguage">What Are Your Top Three Tips for Starting to Learn Another Language</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>When I was younger, I first learned to count to ten, say “I love you”, and <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/basic-phrases/">basic greetings in 20 languages</a>. I was bold and just asked people who spoke the language how to say certain things. You never know when something you learn and tuck away in your brain might come in handy. In one very important case, a Croatian guy was hired at the restaurant that I worked at in college. I was excited to meet him and tried to think of anything I knew about Croatia. I remembered from back in the AIM days, a friend would write <em>Volim te</em> to his Croatian girlfriend as an away message. As I met the new guy at the restaurant, I said <em>Volim te</em> since it was the only thing I knew how to say. If you don’t know - that means “I love you.” He responded to me in Croatian but I told him that was the only thing I knew in his language. We totally hit it off...and <strong>that guy eventually became my husband</strong>. &#x2764;</li>
 	<li>Go to your <strong>local library</strong> and get a book, DVD or something that you can bring home to begin to study the language. Take notes while you are going through the materials in a notebook. It helps you remember things more when you write it down by hand.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ask for help</strong> when you need it. <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/find-language-tutor/">Hire a teacher</a> through an online school or from a local school. If things aren’t working with your current teacher, get another one. If you can’t afford to pay for lessons, get onto a Facebook group. There are so many! You can connect with speakers of your target language and learn something new.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whatareyourtopthreetipsforstartingaconversationwithastrangerinyourtargetlanguage">What Are Your Top Three Tips for Starting a Conversation with a Stranger in Your Target Language</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Greet them! Consider their culture. In the States, people are very friendly and say “How are you” as a greeting rather than wanting to know what is going on with you. If you’re talking to someone from Eastern Europe, <strong>a “hello” will do just fine</strong>!</li>
 	<li><strong>Discuss a topic that could go in many directions</strong>. Travel is always a good one that won’t offend anyone.</li>
 	<li>If you don’t know what else to say, <strong>ask for directions or a recommendation</strong>! Ask the person if they know how to get to a certain place. Ask if they have any tips for you to learn their language. Or ask if they have a favorite food that you should try.</li>

<p>Would you like to learn how to say “thank you” in Dutch?</p>
<p>Even though the Dutch can be quite direct and quick-to-the-point in their conversations, saying thank you is just as appreciated by them.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll teach you 14 ways how to say “thank you” in the Netherlands. So the next time someone gives you a beautiful bouquet of Dutch roses, or invites you to a birthday party, you’ll have plenty of options to thank them for it.</p>
<p>Plus, I’ve divided them into formal and informal responses, so you’ll be expressing gratitude in the proper Dutch way..</p>
<p>It’s probably one of the first things most tourists/<a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dutch-learning-resources/">beginner learners</a> want to know: “How do you say thank you in Dutch?” It’s one of the main building blocks of conversation. So let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="howtosayaninformalthankyouindutch">How to Say an Informal “Thank You” in Dutch</h2>
<p>You wouldn’t write ‘thank u’ to your boss in an email regarding an important meeting you had yesterday after lunch. It’s the same in the Netherlands: You’ve got to watch out a little when you say the Dutch word for “thank you”. The Dutch language has both a formal and informal way to address other people (<em>je</em> and <em>u</em>).</p>
<p>Even though you'll find many natives saying <em>je</em> to everyone, in the beginning, it’s a good practice to use <em>u</em> in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>with someone who’s obviously older than you</li>
<li>with someone who’s in a higher “authority” position (doctors, police officers or your boss)</li>
</ul>
<p>So in these cases, you’d use the formal way of saying “thank you” (I’ll share those in a moment).</p>
<p>But since you most likely won’t find yourself in those highly formal situations often, let’s start with the most common <strong>informal</strong> way of saying “thank you” in Holland.</p>
<h2 id="1thankyouindutchdankjewel">1. “Thank you” in Dutch - <em>Dankjewel</em></h2>
<p>You’ll hear this all the time in the Netherlands. And for good reason: It’s the simplest way of saying thank you in the Dutch language. It’s also the one that most beginners learn first.</p>
<p>It’s actually very easy to learn. It’s almost a straight translation from English, but with the adverb “well” added to the end. It emphasizes that you’re thanking someone with good intention.</p>
<p>If you’re reading Dutch, then you might see several different spellings of this word/words.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dankjewel</em></li>
<li><em>Dank je wel</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.dutchgrammar.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4602">Both are correct</a>. Also, there’s no difference in pronunciation, as most Dutch people speak these words quickly. At first, you may not be able to distinguish that those are actually three words, melded together as one.</p>
<p>Fun experiment: If you want to confuse a Dutch person about their own language, ask them which of the two versions is the correct spelling. Most will likely not know the answer, and will be pleasantly surprised when you tell them they’re both correct!</p>
<h2 id="2thankuindutchdankje">2. “Thank u” in Dutch - <em>Dankje</em></h2>
<p>If you want to quickly thank someone, and you’re speaking to someone you’re close to,shorten <em>dankjewel</em> by skipping the <em>wel</em> at the end. This makes it a little more affectionate and conversational.</p>
<h2 id="3thankyouverymuchindutchechtheelergbedankt">3. “Thank you very much” in Dutch - <em>Echt heel erg bedankt</em></h2>
<p>If you want to know how to say “thank you very much” in Dutch, this is the correct way to say it.</p>
<p>I recommend only saying it when you’re indeed incredibly grateful for something someone did for you. It would be slightly weird to thank a friend for passing the salt for your <em>patat met mayonaise</em>, for example. It’s a perfect way of saying thanks when you get a great giftt for your birthday -- or when a Dutch person <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dutch-mission/">takes the time to speak Dutch with you for 20 minutes</a>, instead of <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/speed-dating/">switching to English</a> right away!</p>
<p>It’s a tough phrase to translate directly into English, but the translation would be something like “Really very much thanks”.</p>
<h2 id="4superthanksindutchsuperbedankt">4. “Super thanks” in Dutch - <em>Superbedankt</em></h2>
<p>This one isn’t that common, but you might hear it between close friends or family. When saying this, it’s obvious that you’re very grateful to the other person. It can also be funny to say this in a sarcastic way, when someone feels as if he’s doing you a huge favour -- whereas in reality, it doesn’t help you at all.</p>
<h2 id="5thanksindutchthanks">5. “Thanks” in Dutch - <em>T(h)anks</em></h2>
<p>The Dutch language is incorporating English more and more. And the language is already one of the closest to English in the first place! (It’s also <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dutch-vs-german/">very close to German</a>, so if you know German already, you have a huge advantage when learning Dutch).</p>
<p>With this in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that you can simply say <em>thanks</em> in Dutch.</p>
<p>The only difference to the English “thanks” is that many Dutchies skip the “h”. It creates a Dutch version that can sound funny to native English speakers. It sounds like “tanks”. Yes, like the ones that drive around on battlefields shooting at the enemy. So if you hear someone screaming “tanks” on the street, you don't need to be worried about World War 3 -- it’s just someone thanking another person!</p>
<h2 id="howtosayaformalthankyouindutch">How to Say a Formal “Thank You” in Dutch</h2>
<p>Now you’ve learned some informal ways of saying “thank you” in Dutch, so let’s look at the more formal phrases for showing gratitude.</p>
<p>As a reminder, it’s a good idea to use these formal ways of saying “thank you”:</p>
<ul>
<li>with someone who’s obviously older than you</li>
<li>with someone who’s in a higher “authority” position (doctors, police officers or your boss)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6formalthankyouindutchdankuwel">6. Formal “Thank you” in Dutch - <em>Dankuwel</em></h2>
<p><em>Dankuwel</em> is very similar to <em>dankjewel</em>, only the informal <em>je</em> has been replaced by the formal <em>u</em>. You can say this in virtually any formal situation, such as when you get your passport back from customs. Or when a police officer helps you find directions to the Dam Square, after you got lost wandering around the Amsterdam canals (that all look so incredibly similar - even natives who don’t live in Amsterdam tend to get lost there over and over again).</p>
<h2 id="7heartythanksindutchhartelijkdank">7. “Hearty thanks” in Dutch - <em>Hartelijk dank</em></h2>
<p>If you want to add some emotion to your formal thanks, then this is the way to go. It’s commonly used by public speakers after a long presentation.</p>
<h2 id="8thankyoualotindutchdankuzeer">8. “Thank you a lot” in Dutch - <em>Dank u zeer</em></h2>
<p>There’s a high chance you’ll never hear this direct translation of “thanks a lot” in Dutch. The word <em>zeer</em> has two meanings, both “very” and “hurt”. So it’s good to know that when someone says this, it means he or she is very grateful. I asked my Dutch friends, and they said this phrase is mainly used by older people. Young people don’t use this phrase anymore, and you can safely skip it unless you want to be a really advanced speaker.</p>
<h2 id="9thanksinadvanceindutchbijvoorbaatdankalvastbedankt">9. “Thanks in advance” in Dutch - <em>Bij voorbaat dank/alvast bedankt</em></h2>
<p>If you’re writing emails in Dutch, then you might want to finish your message by thanking the recipient in advance. Since this will most likely already be a (slightly) formal email exchange, there are two ways to say this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very formal:</strong> <em>bij voorbaat dank</em></li>
<li><strong>A little less formal:</strong> <em>alvast bedankt</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As far as its use is concerned, you can ask yourself the question: “If I were writing this email in English, would I add thanks in advance?” If yes, you can also safely use it in Dutch.</p>
<h2 id="bothformalandinformalwaystosaythankyouindutch">Both Formal and Informal Ways to Say “Thank You” in Dutch</h2>
<p>Since the Netherlands has a low <a href="http://clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede-cultural-dimensions/power-distance-index/">‘power distance’</a>, everyone feels equal. For instance, the boss isn’t considered better than an employee. As such, there are several ways to thank someone that can be used in both formal and informal situations. These are great to know if you’re quite unsure about the formality you need in a specific situation.</p>
<h2 id="10thanksindutchbedankt">10. “Thanks” in Dutch - <em>Bedankt</em></h2>
<p>If you like to keep things simple and want to learn just one word to say “thank you” in every situation, that would be <em>bedankt</em>.</p>
<p><em>Bedankt</em> is the past participle of the verb “to thank” (<em>bedanken</em>). So it’s safe to assume that in the past people used to say <em>ik heb je bedankt</em> (“I have you thanked”). This shortened over time to just <em>bedankt</em>.</p>
<p>It’s probably the second most common way of thanking someone, and it’s slightly more formal than <em>dankjewel</em>. The absence of <em>je</em> or <em>u</em> makes the word very easy to use, as you cannot accidentally mistake the formality.</p>
<p>You can say <em>bedankt</em> to a cashier when you're doing groceries, or when thanking your captain after a boat trip through Amsterdam.</p>
<h2 id="11manythanksindutchheelergbedankt">11. “Many thanks” in Dutch - <em>Heel erg bedankt</em></h2>
<p>“Many thanks” in Dutch is like a shortened version of <em>echt heel erg bedankt</em>, which we discussed before. The absence of <em>echt</em> makes it a bit less emotional, although it’s still something you’d only say when you’re really grateful.</p>
<h2 id="12thankyousomuchindutchontzettendbedankt">12. “Thank you so much” in Dutch - <em>Ontzettend bedankt</em></h2>
<p>The literal translation of <em>ontzettend</em> is “enormous”, so the literal translation of <em>ontzettend bedankt</em> would be “enormous thanks”. A better translation is “thank you so much”. It can be compared to <em>super bedankt</em>, but more suited for general use.</p>
<h2 id="13thankyouallindutchdankjulliewel">13. “Thank you all” in Dutch - <em>Dank jullie wel</em></h2>
<p>In English, the word “you” can be used to address individuals and groups in both formal and informal situations. Dutch isn’t like that. There’s a separate word for “you” in Dutch when you’re addressing a group: <em>jullie</em>.</p>
<p>So naturally, as you’d expect from <em>dankjewel</em> (informal) and <em>dankuwel</em> (formal), there’s also <em>dankjulliewel</em> (plural). This is used when you’re thanking more than one person. For example, you might say <em>dankjulliewel</em> after you’ve had a delicious <em>boerenkool stamppot met braadworst</em> dinner at a Dutch couple’s home.</p>
<h2 id="14howtosaythankyouforindutch">14. How to say “Thank you for…” in Dutch</h2>
<p>Often when you say “thanks”, you want to show your gratitude for something specific. This is another part where Dutch and English are similar, as you simply say <em>dankje voor…</em>.</p>
<p>When the Pope visits the Netherlands, he always says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1KXl4KGVA"><em>bedankt voor de bloemen</em></a> (“thanks for the flowers”).</p>
<p>When you’re saying “thank you for” in Dutch, you can use this simple formula:</p>
<p><strong>Any “thank you” in Dutch + voor + de/het + noun</strong></p>

Even though the Dutch can be quite direct and quick-to-the-point in their conversations, saying thank you is just as appreciated by them.

In this article, I’ll teach you 14 ways how to say “thank you” in the Netherlands. So the next time someone gives you a beautiful bouquet of Dutch roses, or invites you to a birthday party, you’ll have plenty of options to thank them for it.

Plus, I’ve divided them into formal and informal responses, so you’ll be expressing gratitude in the proper Dutch way..

It’s probably one of the first things most tourists/<a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dutch-learning-resources/">beginner learners</a> want to know: “How do you say thank you in Dutch?” It’s one of the main building blocks of conversation. So let’s get started!
<h2 id="howtosayaninformalthankyouindutch">How to Say an Informal “Thank You” in Dutch</h2>
You wouldn’t write ‘thank u’ to your boss in an email regarding an important meeting you had yesterday after lunch. It’s the same in the Netherlands: You’ve got to watch out a little when you say the Dutch word for “thank you”. The Dutch language has both a formal and informal way to address other people (<em>je</em> and <em>u</em>).

Even though you'll find many natives saying <em>je</em> to everyone, in the beginning, it’s a good practice to use <em>u</em> in the following situations:
<ul>
 	<li>with someone who’s obviously older than you</li>
 	<li>with someone who’s in a higher “authority” position (doctors, police officers or your boss)</li>
</ul>
So in these cases, you’d use the formal way of saying “thank you” (I’ll share those in a moment).

But since you most likely won’t find yourself in those highly formal situations often, let’s start with the most common <strong>informal</strong> way of saying “thank you” in Holland.
<h2 id="1thankyouindutchdankjewel">1. “Thank you” in Dutch - <em>Dankjewel</em></h2>
You’ll hear this all the time in the Netherlands. And for good reason: It’s the simplest way of saying thank you in the Dutch language. It’s also the one that most beginners learn first.

It’s actually very easy to learn. It’s almost a straight translation from English, but with the adverb “well” added to the end. It emphasizes that you’re thanking someone with good intention.

If you’re reading Dutch, then you might see several different spellings of this word/words.
<ul>
 	<li><em>Dankjewel</em></li>
 	<li><em>Dank je wel</em></li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.dutchgrammar.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4602">Both are correct</a>. Also, there’s no difference in pronunciation, as most Dutch people speak these words quickly. At first, you may not be able to distinguish that those are actually three words, melded together as one.

Fun experiment: If you want to confuse a Dutch person about their own language, ask them which of the two versions is the correct spelling. Most will likely not know the answer, and will be pleasantly surprised when you tell them they’re both correct!
<h2 id="2thankuindutchdankje">2. “Thank u” in Dutch - <em>Dankje</em></h2>
If you want to quickly thank someone, and you’re speaking to someone you’re close to,shorten <em>dankjewel</em> by skipping the <em>wel</em> at the end. This makes it a little more affectionate and conversational.
<h2 id="3thankyouverymuchindutchechtheelergbedankt">3. “Thank you very much” in Dutch - <em>Echt heel erg bedankt</em></h2>
If you want to know how to say “thank you very much” in Dutch, this is the correct way to say it.

I recommend only saying it when you’re indeed incredibly grateful for something someone did for you. It would be slightly weird to thank a friend for passing the salt for your <em>patat met mayonaise</em>, for example. It’s a perfect way of saying thanks when you get a great giftt for your birthday -- or when a Dutch person <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dutch-mission/">takes the time to speak Dutch with you for 20 minutes</a>, instead of <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/speed-dating/">switching to English</a> right away!

It’s a tough phrase to translate directly into English, but the translation would be something like “Really very much thanks”.
<h2 id="4superthanksindutchsuperbedankt">4. “Super thanks” in Dutch - <em>Superbedankt</em></h2>
This one isn’t that common, but you might hear it between close friends or family. When saying this, it’s obvious that you’re very grateful to the other person. It can also be funny to say this in a sarcastic way, when someone feels as if he’s doing you a huge favour -- whereas in reality, it doesn’t help you at all.
<h2 id="5thanksindutchthanks">5. “Thanks” in Dutch - <em>T(h)anks</em></h2>
The Dutch language is incorporating English more and more. And the language is already one of the closest to English in the first place! (It’s also <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/dutch-vs-german/">very close to German</a>, so if you know German already, you have a huge advantage when learning Dutch).

With this in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that you can simply say <em>thanks</em> in Dutch.

The only difference to the English “thanks” is that many Dutchies skip the “h”. It creates a Dutch version that can sound funny to native English speakers. It sounds like “tanks”. Yes, like the ones that drive around on battlefields shooting at the enemy. So if you hear someone screaming “tanks” on the street, you don't need to be worried about World War 3 -- it’s just someone thanking another person!
<h2 id="howtosayaformalthankyouindutch">How to Say a Formal “Thank You” in Dutch</h2>
Now you’ve learned some informal ways of saying “thank you” in Dutch, so let’s look at the more formal phrases for showing gratitude.

As a reminder, it’s a good idea to use these formal ways of saying “thank you”:
<ul>
 	<li>with someone who’s obviously older than you</li>
 	<li>with someone who’s in a higher “authority” position (doctors, police officers or your boss)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6formalthankyouindutchdankuwel">6. Formal “Thank you” in Dutch - <em>Dankuwel</em></h2>
<em>Dankuwel</em> is very similar to <em>dankjewel</em>, only the informal <em>je</em> has been replaced by the formal <em>u</em>. You can say this in virtually any formal situation, such as when you get your passport back from customs. Or when a police officer helps you find directions to the Dam Square, after you got lost wandering around the Amsterdam canals (that all look so incredibly similar - even natives who don’t live in Amsterdam tend to get lost there over and over again).
<h2 id="7heartythanksindutchhartelijkdank">7. “Hearty thanks” in Dutch - <em>Hartelijk dank</em></h2>
If you want to add some emotion to your formal thanks, then this is the way to go. It’s commonly used by public speakers after a long presentation.
<h2 id="8thankyoualotindutchdankuzeer">8. “Thank you a lot” in Dutch - <em>Dank u zeer</em></h2>
There’s a high chance you’ll never hear this direct translation of “thanks a lot” in Dutch. The word <em>zeer</em> has two meanings, both “very” and “hurt”. So it’s good to know that when someone says this, it means he or she is very grateful. I asked my Dutch friends, and they said this phrase is mainly used by older people. Young people don’t use this phrase anymore, and you can safely skip it unless you want to be a really advanced speaker.
<h2 id="9thanksinadvanceindutchbijvoorbaatdankalvastbedankt">9. “Thanks in advance” in Dutch - <em>Bij voorbaat dank/alvast bedankt</em></h2>
If you’re writing emails in Dutch, then you might want to finish your message by thanking the recipient in advance. Since this will most likely already be a (slightly) formal email exchange, there are two ways to say this.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Very formal:</strong> <em>bij voorbaat dank</em></li>
 	<li><strong>A little less formal:</strong> <em>alvast bedankt</em></li>
</ul>
As far as its use is concerned, you can ask yourself the question: “If I were writing this email in English, would I add thanks in advance?” If yes, you can also safely use it in Dutch.
<h2 id="bothformalandinformalwaystosaythankyouindutch">Both Formal and Informal Ways to Say “Thank You” in Dutch</h2>
Since the Netherlands has a low <a href="http://clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede-cultural-dimensions/power-distance-index/">‘power distance’</a>, everyone feels equal. For instance, the boss isn’t considered better than an employee. As such, there are several ways to thank someone that can be used in both formal and informal situations. These are great to know if you’re quite unsure about the formality you need in a specific situation.
<h2 id="10thanksindutchbedankt">10. “Thanks” in Dutch - <em>Bedankt</em></h2>
If you like to keep things simple and want to learn just one word to say “thank you” in every situation, that would be <em>bedankt</em>.

<em>Bedankt</em> is the past participle of the verb “to thank” (<em>bedanken</em>). So it’s safe to assume that in the past people used to say <em>ik heb je bedankt</em> (“I have you thanked”). This shortened over time to just <em>bedankt</em>.

It’s probably the second most common way of thanking someone, and it’s slightly more formal than <em>dankjewel</em>. The absence of <em>je</em> or <em>u</em> makes the word very easy to use, as you cannot accidentally mistake the formality.

You can say <em>bedankt</em> to a cashier when you're doing groceries, or when thanking your captain after a boat trip through Amsterdam.
<h2 id="11manythanksindutchheelergbedankt">11. “Many thanks” in Dutch - <em>Heel erg bedankt</em></h2>
“Many thanks” in Dutch is like a shortened version of <em>echt heel erg bedankt</em>, which we discussed before. The absence of <em>echt</em> makes it a bit less emotional, although it’s still something you’d only say when you’re really grateful.
<h2 id="12thankyousomuchindutchontzettendbedankt">12. “Thank you so much” in Dutch - <em>Ontzettend bedankt</em></h2>
The literal translation of <em>ontzettend</em> is “enormous”, so the literal translation of <em>ontzettend bedankt</em> would be “enormous thanks”. A better translation is “thank you so much”. It can be compared to <em>super bedankt</em>, but more suited for general use.
<h2 id="13thankyouallindutchdankjulliewel">13. “Thank you all” in Dutch - <em>Dank jullie wel</em></h2>
In English, the word “you” can be used to address individuals and groups in both formal and informal situations. Dutch isn’t like that. There’s a separate word for “you” in Dutch when you’re addressing a group: <em>jullie</em>.

So naturally, as you’d expect from <em>dankjewel</em> (informal) and <em>dankuwel</em> (formal), there’s also <em>dankjulliewel</em> (plural). This is used when you’re thanking more than one person. For example, you might say <em>dankjulliewel</em> after you’ve had a delicious <em>boerenkool stamppot met braadworst</em> dinner at a Dutch couple’s home.
<h2 id="14howtosaythankyouforindutch">14. How to say “Thank you for…” in Dutch</h2>
Often when you say “thanks”, you want to show your gratitude for something specific. This is another part where Dutch and English are similar, as you simply say <em>dankje voor…</em>.

When the Pope visits the Netherlands, he always says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j1KXl4KGVA"><em>bedankt voor de bloemen</em></a> (“thanks for the flowers”).

When you’re saying “thank you for” in Dutch, you can use this simple formula:

<strong>Any “thank you” in Dutch + voor + de/het + noun</strong>
<h2 id="onefinalthingtowatchoutforwhensayingthankyouindutch">One Final Thing to Watch Out For When Saying “Thank You” in Dutch</h2>
In English, if someone asks if you’d like a beer or coffee, and you say “thank you”, people will assume you mean “yes”, or at least double check to see whether you meant “no, thank you”.

In Holland, if you only say <em>dankjewel</em>, there’s a good chance people would assume you mean “no”. It’s seen as a polite refusal of your offer.

So if someone asks you if you want something, be sure to say <em>ja</em> (“yes”), before thanking them for the offer.

<p>The pressure was on. I had about two months. A short eight weeks before I’d be in Budapest, Hungary at a work meeting.</p>
<p>My mission?</p>
<p>To learn Hungarian. But here was the catch, I hadn’t studied Hungarian before at all. Not a word. I was starting from absolute zero.</p>
<p>And while <em>Fluent in 3 Month</em>’s very own Benny Lewis proved <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/budapest-mission-update/">two months was enough to start chatting in Hungarian</a> during his mission, mine came with additional challenges.</p>
<p>During the two months I’d be learning Hungarian, I had just over a week that my studies would be interrupted by a trip to Shanghai, China where focusing on my Chinese and Japanese was paramount. That meant I could only dabble in Hungarian until I returned from that trip just two weeks before I headed to Hungary.</p>
<p>Could I do it?</p>
<p>I turned to Benny for advice:</p>
<p>httpvh://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B0X6ImHVrw&amp;t=373s</p>
<h2 id="thepoweroffocus">The Power of Focus</h2>
<p>This wasn’t my first <a href="http://add1challenge.com"><em>Add1</em></a> (and it wasn’t my last). I’m the <em>Add1</em> Head Coach, so I have plenty to be getting on with supporting our students. It’s my choice whether I learn a language alongside our <em>Add1</em> students.</p>
<p>And I keep doing it! In fact, Hungarian would be my fifth language with Add1.</p>
<p>What kept me coming back?</p>
<p>I knew that if I followed the program, I’d speak Hungarian. And I trusted in that process.</p>
<p>Normally, during a challenge, I just like to focus on one language. This would have been Hungarian, but my other work trip threw in a new challenge for me -- the need to work on Japanese and Chinese at the same time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my Japanese and Chinese were both at a level where conversing regularly and a bit of daily study were enough to support what I needed to do. That way, most of my energy could go to Hungarian.</p>
<p>Here’s where I started:</p>
<p>httpvh://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAaohv1kuI</p>
<p>That’s my Day 0 video for <em>Add1</em> -- one of the four videos we use to document our progress during the 90 days.</p>
<p>You see, the start of my Hungarian project happened to time perfectly with the start of <a href="http://add1challenge.com"><em>Add1</em></a>, though my “Day 90” would be closer to Day 60 of the challenge and my test wouldn’t be a 15-minute conversation (though that did come later).</p>
<p>Instead, I aimed to reach a high enough level to surprise my bosses at a company I work for, <em>Drops</em>. They’re both native Hungarian speakers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25724" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/drops-team-1024x817.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="817" /></p>
<h2 id="howasmallfunprojectbecameabigdeal">How a Small, Fun Project Became a Big Deal</h2>
<p>Initially, the idea came to me as something fun to do. A nice gesture I could make, showing my co-workers how invested I was in the company. It was going to be small. I’d work on the language and then surprise them at some point during our week in Budapest. I was pretty excited about the idea, so I shared it with two of my American co-workers. And then it quickly spiraled into something bigger. MUCH bigger.</p>
<p>Suddenly we were talking about camera crews, staging, a marketing plan… I started to get nervous, wondering what I had gotten myself into.</p>
<p>But instead of letting that nervousness get in my way, I channeled it into my learning. Using it as motivation to succeed.</p>
<p>That nervousness stemmed from fear of failure. The easiest way to quash it? Not fail.</p>
<h2 id="learninghungarianin2monthshowididit">Learning Hungarian in 2 Months: How I Did It</h2>
<p>I started by setting myself milestones, then aimed to hit as many of them as I could, as quickly as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Milestone 1</em>: Get into the <em>Drops</em> dojo by Day 3. <em>Drops</em> was the primary way I studied the Hungarian language and also happens to be one of the companies I worked for (I also work for <em>Fluent in 3 Months</em> and <em>Add1</em>, it’s the life of a professional polyglot!). That was part of the big surprise -- learning the language to surprise my bosses with our very own app! To get into the Dojo, I needed to learn 50 words within the first three days (it’s the minimum requirement to start using the Dojo).</li>
<li><em>Milestone 2</em>: Find someone to practice with. <em>Fluent in 3 Months</em> came to the rescue here and one of my fellow team members, Balint, jumped in to help me out. We scheduled a time to chat, and that date on the calendar helped me keep moving forward with my studies.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25726" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shannon-and-balint.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="975" /></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Milestone 3</em>: Write my first Hungarian script. Benny often discusses the power of <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/month-1-jap/">scripting</a> in learning a language.</li>
<li><em>Milestone 4</em>: Have a Hungarian lesson. I had my first Hungarian lesson early on during my Hungarian mission, but didn’t have another until after I returned from China. During that period, I made up for lost time -- remember we learn in <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/hours-not-years/">hours not years or even days</a>! -- by having anywhere from one to four lessons a day!</li>
<li><em>Milestone 5</em>: Have an unscripted chat in Hungarian. My chat with my bosses wouldn’t be scripted, so I needed to make sure I was comfortable moving “off-script” before the time came.</li>
<li><em>Milestone 6</em>: Learn all the words in <em>Drops</em>. There are around 2,600 words in <em>Drops</em> currently for the 32+ languages it teaches and I wanted to study all of them before my mission’s big finale. This, however, was the only milestone I <em>didn’t</em> reach prior to the chat in Budapest. It turns out it takes some time to really master that many words and two months wasn’t enough. I did reach this milestone shortly after the trip, so not all was lost!</li>
<li><em>Milestone 7</em>: Try out some of my Hungarian in Budapest before the big surprise. I didn’t want my first time using Hungarian outside of the safe confines of a lesson or exchange session to be during my reveal. Instead, I wanted to have my fair share of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMD0-cadtXk">failures</a> and successes before so that I’d be as prepared as possible for my final milestone.</li>
<li><em>Milestone 8</em>: The big reveal.</li>
</ul>
<p>I planned to hit all my milestones during the first 60 days of <em>Add1</em>. My main tools were <em>Drops</em>, and then later, my sessions with my <a href="http://fluentin3months.com/italki-review">italki tutors</a>. There was another Hungarian learner in <em>Add1</em> as well. She was significantly farther along than I was when I started, and her success was my inspiration to keep going (and to be honest, perhaps catch up to!).</p>
<h2 id="thebigreveal">The Big Reveal</h2>
<p>Finding a time to get the founders of <em>Drops</em> alone during our work week proved difficult and it ended up falling on the last day. While this gave me extra days to study and practice, it gave me extra days to fret over how it would go, too.</p>
<p>It also meant more days of keeping the fact I knew Hungarian a secret while in Hungary…</p>
<p>I constantly caught myself slipping up, ordering in Hungarian at restaurants within earshot of the other team members. Answering something in Hungarian. And paying attention when Hungarian conversations happened around me.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no one seemed to notice, but keeping my Hungarian a secret proved difficult! Especially when both of the founders asked me if I had learned Hungarian on multiple occasions and it meant I had to outright lie to keep the surprise, well, a surprise.</p>
<p>The final day arrived and the camera crew ended up being the other members of the marketing team rather than a professional crew. We met in a small room at one of our co-working spaces and my fitness tracker let me know that my heart rate was through the roof.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25727" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shannons-heartrate-1024x263.png" alt="" width="1024" height="263" /></p>
<p>How did I deal with those nerves? I just kept plowing through. I clasped my hands together to hide any shaking, laughed a little more than I might have normally, but most importantly <strong>I did it</strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, I avoided making eye contact with either of the founders, worried it would throw me off or I’d lose my train of thought. I stared at my hands, and it meant I missed their reactions. Happily, the cameras caught them and I was rewarded with seeing them after the fact. Their expressions say <em>everything</em> and it made all the nerves, all the study, and all of the preparation worth it.</p>
<p>Here’s the final video:</p>
<p>httpvh://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWRQsYriO7U</p>

<p>My success with Hungarian was a big occasion for me. And because of it, I have a new “forever” language that I get to share with my team members at <em>Drops</em> (and <em>Fluent in 3 Months</em>). But my story is only one of thousands of success stories in <em>Add1</em>. The community is full of passionate language learners encouraging one another to get to that 15-minute conversation in 90 days. If anyone is struggling, it’s easy to find someone who can relate and offer advice. And every day, challengers are sharing their wins.</p>

I had about two months. A short eight weeks before I’d be in Budapest, Hungary at a work meeting.

My mission?

To learn Hungarian. But here was the catch, I hadn’t studied Hungarian before at all. Not a word. I was starting from absolute zero.

And while <em>Fluent in 3 Month</em>’s very own Benny Lewis proved <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/budapest-mission-update/">two months was enough to start chatting in Hungarian</a> during his mission, mine came with additional challenges.

During the two months I’d be learning Hungarian, I had just over a week that my studies would be interrupted by a trip to Shanghai, China where focusing on my Chinese and Japanese was paramount. That meant I could only dabble in Hungarian until I returned from that trip just two weeks before I headed to Hungary.

Could I do it?

I turned to Benny for advice:

<h2 id="thepoweroffocus">The Power of Focus</h2>
This wasn’t my first <a href="http://add1challenge.com"><em>Add1</em></a> (and it wasn’t my last). I’m the <em>Add1</em> Head Coach, so I have plenty to be getting on with supporting our students. It’s my choice whether I learn a language alongside our <em>Add1</em> students.

And I keep doing it! In fact, Hungarian would be my fifth language with Add1.

What kept me coming back?

I knew that if I followed the program, I’d speak Hungarian. And I trusted in that process.

Normally, during a challenge, I just like to focus on one language. This would have been Hungarian, but my other work trip threw in a new challenge for me -- the need to work on Japanese and Chinese at the same time.

Thankfully, my Japanese and Chinese were both at a level where conversing regularly and a bit of daily study were enough to support what I needed to do. That way, most of my energy could go to Hungarian.

Here’s where I started:

httpvh://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAaohv1kuI

That’s my Day 0 video for <em>Add1</em> -- one of the four videos we use to document our progress during the 90 days.

You see, the start of my Hungarian project happened to time perfectly with the start of <a href="http://add1challenge.com"><em>Add1</em></a>, though my “Day 90” would be closer to Day 60 of the challenge and my test wouldn’t be a 15-minute conversation (though that did come later).

Instead, I aimed to reach a high enough level to surprise my bosses at a company I work for, <em>Drops</em>. They’re both native Hungarian speakers.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25724" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/drops-team-1024x817.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="817" />
<h2 id="howasmallfunprojectbecameabigdeal">How a Small, Fun Project Became a Big Deal</h2>
Initially, the idea came to me as something fun to do. A nice gesture I could make, showing my co-workers how invested I was in the company. It was going to be small. I’d work on the language and then surprise them at some point during our week in Budapest. I was pretty excited about the idea, so I shared it with two of my American co-workers. And then it quickly spiraled into something bigger. MUCH bigger.

Suddenly we were talking about camera crews, staging, a marketing plan… I started to get nervous, wondering what I had gotten myself into.

But instead of letting that nervousness get in my way, I channeled it into my learning. Using it as motivation to succeed.

That nervousness stemmed from fear of failure. The easiest way to quash it? Not fail.
<h2 id="learninghungarianin2monthshowididit">Learning Hungarian in 2 Months: How I Did It</h2>
I started by setting myself milestones, then aimed to hit as many of them as I could, as quickly as possible:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Milestone 1</em>: Get into the <em>Drops</em> dojo by Day 3. <em>Drops</em> was the primary way I studied the Hungarian language and also happens to be one of the companies I worked for (I also work for <em>Fluent in 3 Months</em> and <em>Add1</em>, it’s the life of a professional polyglot!). That was part of the big surprise -- learning the language to surprise my bosses with our very own app! To get into the Dojo, I needed to learn 50 words within the first three days (it’s the minimum requirement to start using the Dojo).</li>
 	<li><em>Milestone 2</em>: Find someone to practice with. <em>Fluent in 3 Months</em> came to the rescue here and one of my fellow team members, Balint, jumped in to help me out. We scheduled a time to chat, and that date on the calendar helped me keep moving forward with my studies.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25726" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shannon-and-balint.jpg" alt="" width="731" height="975" />
<ul>
 	<li><em>Milestone 3</em>: Write my first Hungarian script. Benny often discusses the power of <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/month-1-jap/">scripting</a> in learning a language.</li>
 	<li><em>Milestone 4</em>: Have a Hungarian lesson. I had my first Hungarian lesson early on during my Hungarian mission, but didn’t have another until after I returned from China. During that period, I made up for lost time -- remember we learn in <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/hours-not-years/">hours not years or even days</a>! -- by having anywhere from one to four lessons a day!</li>
 	<li><em>Milestone 5</em>: Have an unscripted chat in Hungarian. My chat with my bosses wouldn’t be scripted, so I needed to make sure I was comfortable moving “off-script” before the time came.</li>
 	<li><em>Milestone 6</em>: Learn all the words in <em>Drops</em>. There are around 2,600 words in <em>Drops</em> currently for the 32+ languages it teaches and I wanted to study all of them before my mission’s big finale. This, however, was the only milestone I <em>didn’t</em> reach prior to the chat in Budapest. It turns out it takes some time to really master that many words and two months wasn’t enough. I did reach this milestone shortly after the trip, so not all was lost!</li>
 	<li><em>Milestone 7</em>: Try out some of my Hungarian in Budapest before the big surprise. I didn’t want my first time using Hungarian outside of the safe confines of a lesson or exchange session to be during my reveal. Instead, I wanted to have my fair share of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMD0-cadtXk">failures</a> and successes before so that I’d be as prepared as possible for my final milestone.</li>
 	<li><em>Milestone 8</em>: The big reveal.</li>
</ul>
I planned to hit all my milestones during the first 60 days of <em>Add1</em>. My main tools were <em>Drops</em>, and then later, my sessions with my <a href="http://fluentin3months.com/italki-review">italki tutors</a>. There was another Hungarian learner in <em>Add1</em> as well. She was significantly farther along than I was when I started, and her success was my inspiration to keep going (and to be honest, perhaps catch up to!).
<h2 id="thebigreveal">The Big Reveal</h2>
Finding a time to get the founders of <em>Drops</em> alone during our work week proved difficult and it ended up falling on the last day. While this gave me extra days to study and practice, it gave me extra days to fret over how it would go, too.

It also meant more days of keeping the fact I knew Hungarian a secret while in Hungary…

I constantly caught myself slipping up, ordering in Hungarian at restaurants within earshot of the other team members. Answering something in Hungarian. And paying attention when Hungarian conversations happened around me.

Thankfully, no one seemed to notice, but keeping my Hungarian a secret proved difficult! Especially when both of the founders asked me if I had learned Hungarian on multiple occasions and it meant I had to outright lie to keep the surprise, well, a surprise.

The final day arrived and the camera crew ended up being the other members of the marketing team rather than a professional crew. We met in a small room at one of our co-working spaces and my fitness tracker let me know that my heart rate was through the roof.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25727" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shannons-heartrate-1024x263.png" alt="" width="1024" height="263" />

How did I deal with those nerves? I just kept plowing through. I clasped my hands together to hide any shaking, laughed a little more than I might have normally, but most importantly <strong>I did it</strong>.

At the time, I avoided making eye contact with either of the founders, worried it would throw me off or I’d lose my train of thought. I stared at my hands, and it meant I missed their reactions. Happily, the cameras caught them and I was rewarded with seeing them after the fact. Their expressions say <em>everything</em> and it made all the nerves, all the study, and all of the preparation worth it.

Here’s the final video:

My success with Hungarian was a big occasion for me. And because of it, I have a new “forever” language that I get to share with my team members at <em>Drops</em> (and <em>Fluent in 3 Months</em>). But my story is only one of thousands of success stories in <em>Add1</em>. The community is full of passionate language learners encouraging one another to get to that 15-minute conversation in 90 days. If anyone is struggling, it’s easy to find someone who can relate and offer advice. And every day, challengers are sharing their wins.

Do you want that to be you, too? What language have you hoped to speak? Are you ready to finally have a conversation in your target language like I did?

<p>I’ve been learning languages on and off for more years than I’d like to count. Different books and websites and ways to figure out languages come and go, but only one always remains: Anki (available for <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/anki-ios">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, and <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">desktop</a>).</p>
<p>Anki cards are basically digital flashcards that you can use on both your computer and your mobile device, but they’re so, so much more than that.</p>
<p>If you think I love Anki because it saves paper, you’re… well you’re not wrong, but you’re not completely right, either. Honestly, Anki is a <em>dream</em> for language learners, because instead of forcing you to learn the same terms over and over and over and over again, it puts the easy stuff to the side and drills you on what you’re having a hard time with.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of all the Anki features that I love and why they make Anki the perfect tool for language learners.</p>
<h2 id="howtouseankitolearnalanguage">How to Use Anki to Learn a Language</h2>
<p>Anki only shows you words that you’re on the verge of forgetting. This little trick of knowing what terms to show you, and when, is known as <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/">Spaced Repetition</a>. It’s only one of the features of Anki. Nonetheless, let me explain what Spaced Repetition is, and why you absolutely <em>need</em> it in your language learning life.</p>
<h2 id="youtellankiwhichwordsyoufindeasymediumordifficulttorecall">You Tell Anki Which Words You Find Easy, Medium or Difficult to Recall</h2>
<p>The Anki language app works like this: you plug in your vocab, review your words for the day, then tell Anki how easy or difficult those words were to remember. You do this by selecting: easy, medium, or hard. Anki uses this information to plug these cards into its algorithm. It then waits longer and longer to show you the cards that were easier for you to remember, and shows you the most difficult ones (the ones you got wrong) right away, as if they were brand new.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25824" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards1-567x1024.png" alt="" width="567" height="1024" /></p>
<p>As the days go by, you’ll see the timing between when you see these easier cards increases -- from three days, to a week, to a couple of weeks, then a month, etc. When you remember a work correctly, Anki slowly creates more and more space between reminders for that word. This is how the Anki language app gets these cards into your long term memory, which is <em>exactly</em> what we’re going for. Instead of seeing the easy cards every day forever, which takes up more time than any of us have, we only see them <em>just</em> enough times to remember them, and at just the right time.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, is a <strong>major</strong> time saver. I mean, depending on how you approach your language learning, you could be learning hundreds of words, phrases, and grammatical concepts at a time! That’s a lot, and nobody has time to review every single thing over and over again. And even if that’s a thing that you do with normal flashcards, you shouldn’t just put away the easy cards forever, but, at the same time, we can’t be expected to know the <em>optimal</em> time for reviewing them.</p>
<p>So, instead, the Anki language app puts the easier stuff away for just enough time so that you can focus on what you should actually be focusing on: drilling the flashcards that your brain just doesn’t like. Then, every once in a while, it flashes an easy card at you so you don’t forget.</p>
<h2 id="youcanaddimagesandaudiotoankiflashcardstoo">You Can Add Images and Audio to Anki Flashcards Too!</h2>
<p>Although Anki’s Spaced Repetition algorithm is amazing, it’s not even the only thing it has to offer. See, these aren’t just your average “word on the front, definition on the back” flashcards. Nope, the Anki language app has a <strong>lot</strong> more.</p>
<p>Are you a visual learner? Do you recognize people’s faces, but can’t remember their names? Well, Anki gives you the option to upload images directly onto your card. You can add images to either side of your cards, and they can be anything. If you can’t find a picture, Anki even connects to the camera on your phone, so you can take a picture of your desk directly in the app to learn that term.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25825" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards2-972x1024.png" alt="" width="972" height="1024" /></p>
<p>Another wonderful option for us language learners is the ability to upload audio. The amount of time you spend learning your vocab and <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/listening-skills/">training your ear to hear it</a> can be combined into one, just by uploading an audio file of the word. You <em>definitely</em> can’t do that with normal flashcards!</p>
<h2 id="ankicanevenhelpwithspellingsentencestructuresandmore">Anki Can Even Help with Spelling, Sentence Structures, and More</h2>
<p>There’s yet another way that Anki blows regular flashcards out of the water: typing. You don’t have to just stick to basic recall. You have a couple more options than that. For example, typing your terms in instead of just seeing them. I personally <strong>love</strong> this, it’s the only way I learn vocab these days.</p>
<p>This way, I’m not just learning to vaguely recognize the word, but I’m learning to spell it, which is important for learning to write in the language. I tell ya, it makes a <em>world</em> of difference to have to <em>really</em> understand the word and how to spell it, accents and all, as opposed to just going “yeah that word, not sure how to pronounce it or spell it, but yeah, it looks like that!”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25826" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards3-971x1024.png" alt="" width="971" height="1024" /></p>
<p>Or, you can opt to use Anki’s “cloze” feature, which takes any part of a word, phrase, or sentence, and replaces it with an ellipsis, so you can use Anki to practice any number of things: spelling, conjugating verbs, completing a new phrase, etc.</p>
<p>That’s right: you can use Anki flashcards to learn to conjugate your verbs. Crazy, right? That’s <strong>much</strong> better than sitting there and copying down your “I/you/he/she/it/they/us” verb charts for all of eternity.</p>
<h2 id="ankiletsyouborrowflashcarddecksfromotherlanguagelearners">Anki Lets You “Borrow” Flashcard Decks from Other Language Learners</h2>
<p>What if you love the opportunities that all these features have to offer, but you don’t want to go through the motions of making Anki cards yourself? Well, fortunately, Anki hosts <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">shared decks</a>. Shared decks are Anki decks created by other users made public, so anybody can access them and learn with them. And you can find a variety of topics, from languages to geography to random history facts.</p>
<p>If you go to the Anki shared decks, you can click through to the most popular subjects. Or, if you’re looking for something else, there’s a search bar on the upper righthand corner. Search for literally anything in the world and I can guarantee that you’ll find something. You’d be amazed by the kinds of things people are using Anki to learn.</p>
<p>If you’ve built up a really helpful Anki deck, you can share it, either with just a couple friends or the entire world. The Anki site is completely open to anybody to access or create any kind of cards imaginable, which is amazing. Plus, users take their Anki decks seriously, so you can find some really helpful, in-depth information.</p>
<h2 id="youcanuseankiforlanguagelearningonyourlaptoporyourphone">You Can Use Anki for Language Learning on Your Laptop or Your Phone</h2>
<p>Anki is available for both desktop and mobile, which makes it great for everybody, no matter what device you use. There are plenty of language learning services out there that only work on mobile (which, even though I’m more than comfortable using my phone, is still incredibly annoying to me), and others that don’t offer the same functionality on mobile.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Anki is almost exactly the same both on desktop and mobile, which I love. It’s simple enough that I’m totally okay just using the mobile app, but there’s really no difference between it and the desktop version - the desktop app is just bigger text on a bigger screen.</p>
<p>And I know what you’re thinking: “it must be complicated, though, to keep track of where you are in your flashcards between two different devices!” Well, it’s not. Both devices sync easily to the Anki database. Not only do you not lose your cards if something happens to a computer or phone, but you just need to check back in with the database when switching devices to make sure you’re all up to date.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25827" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards4-901x1024.png" alt="" width="901" height="1024" /></p>
<p>What do you have to do to sync? Refresh your page (on mobile) or press a button (on desktop). And that’s it. Anki syncs deleted cards, new cards, edited cards, recently reviewed cards... everything. And because the program is so bare-bones, it’s quick. So even if you need a good refresh on your device, you won’t have to wait long before studying.</p>
<h2 id="ankicardsuglybutworthit">Anki Cards: Ugly, But Worth It</h2>
<p>We live in this glorious age of technology where everything is beautiful. We get huge, 4k Ultra HD TVs, cute apps on our phones that make little noises, and fun memorization games. So I get it when you first take a look at Anki and you’re underwhelmed. We’re spoiled by pretty tech and Anki is definitely <strong>not</strong> pretty.</p>
<p>It’s, honestly, the ugliest language learning resource on the market. But it’s also the best. I use it every single day, I’m obsessed. Other websites try to do a similar thing, and they’re much more aesthetically pleasing, but they just don’t have the power that Anki has. <a href="https://crashedculture.com/memrise-vs-duolingo/">Duolingo and Memrise</a>, for example, are really pretty programs that attempt Spaced Repetition but don’t quite hit the mark. Nobody does flashcards better than Anki cards. Pretty is great, but it’s not everything.</p>
<p>So there you have it. In my opinion, the one language learning resource that every language learner needs. There is no better way to learn your vocab, practice conjugations, passively practice listening, or any number of other skills that you can improve with Anki’s options. I know, it’s ugly, but looks aren’t everything!</p>
<p>Want to try it for yourself? Anki is available for <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/anki-ios">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, and <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">desktop</a>.</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25824" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards1-567x1024.png" alt="" width="567" height="1024" />

As the days go by, you’ll see the timing between when you see these easier cards increases -- from three days, to a week, to a couple of weeks, then a month, etc. When you remember a work correctly, Anki slowly creates more and more space between reminders for that word. This is how the Anki language app gets these cards into your long term memory, which is <em>exactly</em> what we’re going for. Instead of seeing the easy cards every day forever, which takes up more time than any of us have, we only see them <em>just</em> enough times to remember them, and at just the right time.

And that, my friends, is a <strong>major</strong> time saver. I mean, depending on how you approach your language learning, you could be learning hundreds of words, phrases, and grammatical concepts at a time! That’s a lot, and nobody has time to review every single thing over and over again. And even if that’s a thing that you do with normal flashcards, you shouldn’t just put away the easy cards forever, but, at the same time, we can’t be expected to know the <em>optimal</em> time for reviewing them.

So, instead, the Anki language app puts the easier stuff away for just enough time so that you can focus on what you should actually be focusing on: drilling the flashcards that your brain just doesn’t like. Then, every once in a while, it flashes an easy card at you so you don’t forget.
<h2 id="youcanaddimagesandaudiotoankiflashcardstoo">You Can Add Images and Audio to Anki Flashcards Too!</h2>
Although Anki’s Spaced Repetition algorithm is amazing, it’s not even the only thing it has to offer. See, these aren’t just your average “word on the front, definition on the back” flashcards. Nope, the Anki language app has a <strong>lot</strong> more.

Are you a visual learner? Do you recognize people’s faces, but can’t remember their names? Well, Anki gives you the option to upload images directly onto your card. You can add images to either side of your cards, and they can be anything. If you can’t find a picture, Anki even connects to the camera on your phone, so you can take a picture of your desk directly in the app to learn that term.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25825" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards2-972x1024.png" alt="" width="972" height="1024" />

Another wonderful option for us language learners is the ability to upload audio. The amount of time you spend learning your vocab and <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/listening-skills/">training your ear to hear it</a> can be combined into one, just by uploading an audio file of the word. You <em>definitely</em> can’t do that with normal flashcards!
<h2 id="ankicanevenhelpwithspellingsentencestructuresandmore">Anki Can Even Help with Spelling, Sentence Structures, and More</h2>
There’s yet another way that Anki blows regular flashcards out of the water: typing. You don’t have to just stick to basic recall. You have a couple more options than that. For example, typing your terms in instead of just seeing them. I personally <strong>love</strong> this, it’s the only way I learn vocab these days.

This way, I’m not just learning to vaguely recognize the word, but I’m learning to spell it, which is important for learning to write in the language. I tell ya, it makes a <em>world</em> of difference to have to <em>really</em> understand the word and how to spell it, accents and all, as opposed to just going “yeah that word, not sure how to pronounce it or spell it, but yeah, it looks like that!”

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25826" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards3-971x1024.png" alt="" width="971" height="1024" />

Or, you can opt to use Anki’s “cloze” feature, which takes any part of a word, phrase, or sentence, and replaces it with an ellipsis, so you can use Anki to practice any number of things: spelling, conjugating verbs, completing a new phrase, etc.

That’s right: you can use Anki flashcards to learn to conjugate your verbs. Crazy, right? That’s <strong>much</strong> better than sitting there and copying down your “I/you/he/she/it/they/us” verb charts for all of eternity.
<h2 id="ankiletsyouborrowflashcarddecksfromotherlanguagelearners">Anki Lets You “Borrow” Flashcard Decks from Other Language Learners</h2>
What if you love the opportunities that all these features have to offer, but you don’t want to go through the motions of making Anki cards yourself? Well, fortunately, Anki hosts <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/">shared decks</a>. Shared decks are Anki decks created by other users made public, so anybody can access them and learn with them. And you can find a variety of topics, from languages to geography to random history facts.

If you go to the Anki shared decks, you can click through to the most popular subjects. Or, if you’re looking for something else, there’s a search bar on the upper righthand corner. Search for literally anything in the world and I can guarantee that you’ll find something. You’d be amazed by the kinds of things people are using Anki to learn.

If you’ve built up a really helpful Anki deck, you can share it, either with just a couple friends or the entire world. The Anki site is completely open to anybody to access or create any kind of cards imaginable, which is amazing. Plus, users take their Anki decks seriously, so you can find some really helpful, in-depth information.
<h2 id="youcanuseankiforlanguagelearningonyourlaptoporyourphone">You Can Use Anki for Language Learning on Your Laptop or Your Phone</h2>
Anki is available for both desktop and mobile, which makes it great for everybody, no matter what device you use. There are plenty of language learning services out there that only work on mobile (which, even though I’m more than comfortable using my phone, is still incredibly annoying to me), and others that don’t offer the same functionality on mobile.

Fortunately, Anki is almost exactly the same both on desktop and mobile, which I love. It’s simple enough that I’m totally okay just using the mobile app, but there’s really no difference between it and the desktop version - the desktop app is just bigger text on a bigger screen.

And I know what you’re thinking: “it must be complicated, though, to keep track of where you are in your flashcards between two different devices!” Well, it’s not. Both devices sync easily to the Anki database. Not only do you not lose your cards if something happens to a computer or phone, but you just need to check back in with the database when switching devices to make sure you’re all up to date.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-25827" src="https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Anki-Cards4-901x1024.png" alt="" width="901" height="1024" />

What do you have to do to sync? Refresh your page (on mobile) or press a button (on desktop). And that’s it. Anki syncs deleted cards, new cards, edited cards, recently reviewed cards... everything. And because the program is so bare-bones, it’s quick. So even if you need a good refresh on your device, you won’t have to wait long before studying.
<h2 id="ankicardsuglybutworthit">Anki Cards: Ugly, But Worth It</h2>
We live in this glorious age of technology where everything is beautiful. We get huge, 4k Ultra HD TVs, cute apps on our phones that make little noises, and fun memorization games. So I get it when you first take a look at Anki and you’re underwhelmed. We’re spoiled by pretty tech and Anki is definitely <strong>not</strong> pretty.

It’s, honestly, the ugliest language learning resource on the market. But it’s also the best. I use it every single day, I’m obsessed. Other websites try to do a similar thing, and they’re much more aesthetically pleasing, but they just don’t have the power that Anki has. <a href="https://crashedculture.com/memrise-vs-duolingo/">Duolingo and Memrise</a>, for example, are really pretty programs that attempt Spaced Repetition but don’t quite hit the mark. Nobody does flashcards better than Anki cards. Pretty is great, but it’s not everything.

So there you have it. In my opinion, the one language learning resource that every language learner needs. There is no better way to learn your vocab, practice conjugations, passively practice listening, or any number of other skills that you can improve with Anki’s options. I know, it’s ugly, but looks aren’t everything!

Want to try it for yourself? Anki is available for <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/anki-ios">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;hl=en">Android</a>, and <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">desktop</a>.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/anki-cards/">How to use Anki Cards to Learn a Language</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fluentin3months.com">Fluent in 3 months - Language Hacking and Travel Tips</a>.</p>

<p>Would you like to learn how to talk about the weather in Spanish? That makes sense, since talking about the weather is something <em>everyone</em> does.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Nice day today, huh?”</li>
<li>“I’m enjoying this sunny weather.”</li>
<li>“I wish the rain would stop.” (And yes, it does rain a lot on the Atlantic coast of Spain, especially in the north)</li>
</ul>
<p>Weather is what we use as <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/conversational-spanish/">small talk and conversation fillers</a>. That’s because it’s something easy everyone can relate to. So it’s the perfect place to start when learning Spanish!</p>
<p>Talking about the weather in Spanish also makes it incredibly easy to practice speaking. There will never be a time you can’t look out the window and describe the weather out loud. You can ask your language exchange partner what the weather is like where he or she lives. In fact, a lot of <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/italki-review/">online tutors</a> and language exchange partners that I’ve used start a conversation by asking about the weather. And you can even set up Google to recognize Spanish and ask it for today’s forecast. Then you’ll get listening and speaking practice, too!</p>
<p>Learning how to talk about the weather is usually among my first topics to learn in a new language. Because when I travel, it will always save me from awkward pauses. If I don’t know what else to say I can throw in something about the weather, and the conversation sparks up again. Especially in most Spanish-speaking countries, where the weather can rapidly change or have extreme conditions. Everyone’s willing to vent a little about the too-hot days, or a rapid cold snap.</p>
<p>So let’s learn how to talk about the easiest of conversation starters: the weather in Spanish.</p>
<h2 id="spanishweathervocab">Spanish Weather Vocab</h2>
<p>First, let’s learn the words that describe the weather. There are many weather conditions you could talk about, and a lot of words to go with them. But, there are common themes and ways to memorize them, which I’ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<h3 id="spanishweathernouns">Spanish Weather Nouns:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weather: <em>el tiempo</em> or <em>el clima</em></li>
<li>Sun: <em>el sol</em></li>
<li>Clouds: <em>las nubes</em></li>
<li>Rain: <em>la lluvia</em></li>
<li>Thunder: <em>el trueno</em></li>
<li>Lightning: <em>el relámpago</em></li>
<li>Fog: <em>la niebla</em></li>
<li>Snow: <em>la nieve</em></li>
<li>Wind: <em>el viento</em></li>
<li>Storm: <em>la tormenta</em></li>
<li>Sleet: <em>las aguanieve</em></li>
<li>Frost: <em>la helada</em></li>
<li>Hail: <em>el granizo</em></li>
<li>Rainbow: <em>los arco iris</em></li>
<li>Breeze: <em>la brisa</em></li>
<li>Temperature: <em>la temperatura</em></li>
<li>Degrees: <em>los grados</em></li>
<li>Season: <em>la temporada</em></li>
<li>Spring: <em>la primavera</em></li>
<li>Summer: <em>el verano</em></li>
<li>Fall: <em>el otoño</em></li>
<li>Winter: <em>el invierno</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The word <em>tiempo</em> (“weather”) has many different meanings in Spanish, including “time”, “tempo” and “grammar tense”. So if you want to be clear, you can use <em>clima</em>. That means both “climate” and “weather”. Unlike the English word “climate”, <em>clima</em> can be used to describe current weather, not just the general weather of an area.</p>
<h3 id="spanishweatheradjectives">Spanish Weather Adjectives:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sunny: <em>soleado</em></li>
<li>Cloudy: <em>nublado</em></li>
<li>Windy: <em>ventoso</em></li>
<li>Misty: <em>neblina</em></li>
<li>Foggy: <em>niebla</em></li>
<li>Clear: <em>despejado</em></li>
<li>Bad weather: <em>mal tiempo</em></li>
<li>Good weather: <em>buen tiempo</em></li>
<li>Hot: <em>calor</em></li>
<li>Cold: <em>frío.</em></li>
<li>Warm: <em>cálido</em></li>
<li>Cool: <em>fresco</em></li>
<li>Humid: <em>húmedo</em></li>
<li>Bitter cold or freezing: <em>glacial</em></li>
<li>Chilly: <em>friolero</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spanishweatherverbs">Spanish Weather Verbs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shining: <em>brillando</em></li>
<li>Raining: <em>lloviendo</em></li>
<li>Snowing: <em>nevando</em></li>
<li>Storming: <em>asaltando</em></li>
<li>Sleeting: <em>agobiante</em></li>
<li>Drizzling: <em>llovizna</em></li>
<li>Pouring: <em>torrencial</em></li>
<li>Hailing: <em>llamando</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spanishwordsforextremeweatherconditions">Spanish Words for Extreme Weather Conditions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hailstorm: <em>la granizada</em></li>
<li>Hurricane: <em>el huracán</em></li>
<li>Tornado: <em>el tornado</em></li>
<li>Blizzard: <em>la tormenta de nieve</em></li>
<li>Earthquake: <em>el terremoto</em></li>
<li>Flood: <em>la inundación</em></li>
<li>Windstorm: <em>la tormenta de viento</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtomemorisespanishweatherwords">How to Memorise Spanish Weather Words</h2>
<p>You’re probably thinking that I’ve shared a lot of Spanish weather words, and you’re wondering how you can memorise so many words. Thankfully there are some simple memory hacks you can use.</p>
<h3 id="memoryhack1lookforspanishweathercognates">Memory Hack 1: Look for Spanish Weather Cognates</h3>
<p>Some Spanish weather words are cognates, which means they resemble their English counterpart in some way. This makes them easier to remember!</p>
<p>These are words like <em>sol</em> for “sun”, which is similar to “solar”. Or <em>el huracán</em>, which is almost the same as “hurricane”.</p>
<p>Others, like <em>glacial</em> and <em>torrencial</em> are similar to how we describe a glacial cold or torrential downpour. <em>Terremoto</em> resembles both “tremble” and “terrestrial”, meaning the earth trembles. And <em>aguanieve</em>, which is “sleet”, describes the exact state of the weather: a mix of water (<em>agua</em>) and snow (<em>nieve</em>).</p>
<h3 id="memoryhack2lookforpatterns">Memory Hack 2: Look for Patterns</h3>
<p>Most Spanish weather words relating to rain start with “lla”. And words relating to snow start with “nie” or “ne”.</p>
<h3 id="memoryhack3focusyourenergies">Memory Hack 3: Focus Your Energies</h3>
<p>Instead of trying to learn all the Spanish weather words at once, focus on those you’re most likely to use in real conversations. For example, since I’m from Ireland, when I’m talking about the weather of my home country I’ll talk about <em>la lluvia</em> (“the rain”) a lot, so that’s an important word for me to know.</p>
<h3 id="memoryhack4usewhatyouvelearnedinrealconversations">Memory Hack 4: Use What You’ve Learned in Real Conversations</h3>
<p>My number one tip for learning a new language is to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/">Speak from Day One</a>. This will build your confidence, and cement what you’ve learned into your memory.</p>
<p>If you’d like to do this, I recommend booking a sessions with a <a href="https://fluentin3months.com/italki">Spanish italki tutor</a>. For complete beginners, I recommend starting with my free <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/join/">Speak in a Week</a> course.</p>
<h2 id="talkingabouttheweatherinspanishhelpingverbs">Talking about the Weather in Spanish: Helping Verbs</h2>
<p>In Spanish, you almost always need helping verbs to talk about the weather. There are three verbs you’ll use: <em>hacer</em>, <em>estar</em> and <em>haber</em>.</p>
<p>It may seem a bit strange to use phrases that literally translate as “The weather makes rain,” or “There is weather.” But that’s just how it works in Spanish.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of exceptions to this rule. Very common weather conditions have been simplified to single words. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It rains: <em>llueve</em></li>
<li>It drizzles: <em>llovizna</em></li>
<li>It snows: <em>nieva</em></li>
<li>It thunders: <em>truena</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can simply say these on their own, and they make sense. For example, looking out the window and commenting, “<em>Llueve</em>”.</p>
<h3 id="helpingverb1hacertheweatherdoesormakes">Helping Verb 1: <em>Hacer</em> -- The Weather “Does” or “Makes”</h3>
<p>The Spanish verb <em>hacer</em> pairs with most words to talk about the weather. Although we normally translate this as “to make”, in this case the more natural English translation would be “it is”.</p>
<p>So what does the weather “make”?</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s hot: <em>Hace calor</em></li>
<li>It’s cold: <em>Hace frío</em></li>
<li>It’s nice weather: <em>Hace buen tiempo</em></li>
<li>It’s very bad weather: <em>Hace muy mal tiempo</em></li>
<li>It’s sunny: <em>Hace sol</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hacer</em> is usually used to describe the feeling of the weather, so you can think of it like “It makes it feel hot” or “It makes it feel cold.” You pair <em>hacer</em> with descriptive words about the feeling of the weather outside.</p>
<h3 id="helpingverb2estartheweatheris">Helping Verb 2: <em>Estar</em> -- The Weather “is”</h3>
<p>When referring to the weather, <em>estar</em> takes on the third person form, <em>está</em>. Which makes sense - you’re not talking about yourself, or another person, but an “it”. <em>Estar</em> is the verb for “to be” when it’s not permanent, so don’t confuse it with <em>ser</em> (permanent “to be”).</p>
<p><em>Estar</em> can be used with both verbs and adjectives to describe the current condition.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s raining very hard: <em>Está lloviendo muy fuerte</em></li>
<li>It’s sunny: <em>Está soleado</em></li>
<li>It’s stormy: <em>Está tormentoso</em></li>
<li>It’s very humid: <em>Está muy húmedo</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="helpingverb3haberthereisweather">Helping Verb 3: <em>Haber</em>: “There is” Weather</h3>
<p><em>Haber</em> is used as <em>hay</em> when talking about the weather, and it’s mostly for factual statements such as “There is a hurricane” or “There is a storm”.</p>
<p>It’s usually translated as “it is”. For instance, “It is foggy” is <em>Hay niebla</em>. Literally, “There is fog.” <em>Hay</em> is most often paired with the noun form of the weather.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s stormy: <em>Hay tormenta</em></li>
<li>There’s a flood: <em>Hay una inundación</em></li>
<li>There’s rain: <em>Hay lluvia</em></li>
<li>It’s windy: <em>Hay viento</em></li>
<li>There’s snow: <em>Hay nieve</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It can be a bit confusing to get used to which helping verb to use. If you think of <em>hacer</em> for adjectives, <em>estar</em> for verbs and <em>haber</em> for nouns, you’ll usually get it right.</p>
<h2 id="askingabouttheweatherinspanish">Asking about the Weather in Spanish</h2>
<p>Okay, we know how to say some basic things about the current weather. But how do we ask others?</p>
<p>When you want to ask about the weather outside, or in someone else’s area, here are some phrases you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the weather like today?: <em>¿Qué tiempo hace hoy?</em></li>
<li>How is the weather today?: <em>¿Cómo está el clima hoy?</em> or <em>¿Cómo está el tiempo hoy?</em></li>
<li>What’s it like outside?: <em>¿Cómo es afuera?</em> or <em>¿Cómo está por fuera?</em></li>
<li>What’s the weather like in ?: *¿Cómo es el clima en ?*</li>
<li>Is it cold outside?: <em>¿Hace frío afuera?</em></li>
<li>Is it raining outside?: <em>¿Está lloviendo afuera?</em></li>
<li>Is there snow?: <em>¿Hay nieve?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So you can see how to turn phrases with <em>hacer</em>, <em>estar</em> and <em>haber</em> into questions.</p>
<h2 id="spanishweatherphrases">Spanish Weather Phrases</h2>
<p>We have quite a few English idioms about weather. The most famous example is probably “it’s raining cats and dogs,” or “it’s pouring buckets.” Spanish has phrases like that, too. You’ll also want to know how to ask someone how the weather makes them feel, or how to describe your own feelings.</p>
<h3 id="commonspanishweatherphrases">Common Spanish Weather Phrases</h3>
<p>A few popular idiomatic phrases are <em>Llueve a mares</em> (“It’s raining the seas”), which is closest to “it’s raining cats and dogs.” You could also describe heavy rains with <em>Llueve a cántaros</em>, or “It’s raining jugs.”</p>
<p>To talk about how cold it is, you might say <em>Hace un frío que pela</em>. It translates to “it’s so cold, it burns,” but it means “It’s freezing!” And for heat, you can use <em>Hace un calor tremendo</em> (“It makes a tremendous heat.”)</p>
<p>In springtime, you can say <em>La primavera, la sangre altera</em>, or “Spring alters blood.” It just means that you can feel in the air that spring is coming.</p>
<p>There’s also the idiom, <em>Siempre que llovió, paró</em> which translates to “Every time it rained, it stopped,” or “This too will pass.”</p>
<h3 id="spanishphrasestodescribehowtheweathermakesyoufeel">Spanish Phrases to Describe How the Weather Makes You Feel</h3>
<p>Usually, when making small talk about the weather, you discuss how it makes you feel. “<em>Hace un calor tremendo</em>!” would be followed with <em>Lo sé. Estoy sudando como un pollo!</em> (“I know. I’m sweating like a chicken!”)</p>
<p>If you want to ask how someone’s feeling, you can say <em>¿Tienes ____?</em> For instance, “Are you feeling hot?” would be <em>¿Tienes calor?</em> To which they might respond, <em>Si, tengo calor.</em></p>
<p>Here are a few other Spanish weather words and phrases to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burning up: <em>quemando</em></li>
<li>Dying of heat: <em>muero de calor</em></li>
<li>Sweaty: <em>sudoroso</em> or <em>sudorosa</em></li>
<li>Really cold: <em>mucho frio</em></li>
<li>Freezing: <em>congelando</em></li>
<li>It’s an oven outside: <em>Es un horno afuera</em></li>
<li>It’s an icebox outside: <em>Es una nevera fuera</em></li>
<li>Cool as a cucumber: <em>Más fresco que una lechuga</em> (Literally: “Cooler than lettuce”)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="masteringspanishweathersmalltalk">Mastering Spanish Weather Small Talk</h2>
<p>Now it’s over to you! Practice these expressions to describe your daily weather, and you’ll be prepared for small talk in any situation. You can also look up the weather in Spanish, and listen to the forecast or read about it. That will help instil how native speakers hear and talk about the weather. You could even use <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/language-learning-instagram/">Instagram to boost your language skills</a> and search for things like “#tiempo” or “#clima”.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to move on to other icebreakers to keep the conversation flowing, make sure to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spanish-questions/">master your questions to ask about others</a>. You can even learn about the other universal small talk topic: <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/food-in-spanish/">Spanish food culture and vocab</a>.</p>
<p>What about you? Are there any weather-related phrases you use all the time in Spanish? What other ways can you practice weather vocab in Spanish? Leave us a comment and let me know.</p>

That makes sense, since talking about the weather is something <em>everyone</em> does.
<ul>
 	<li>“Nice day today, huh?”</li>
 	<li>“I’m enjoying this sunny weather.”</li>
 	<li>“I wish the rain would stop.” (And yes, it does rain a lot on the Atlantic coast of Spain, especially in the north)</li>
</ul>
Weather is what we use as <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/conversational-spanish/">small talk and conversation fillers</a>. That’s because it’s something easy everyone can relate to. So it’s the perfect place to start when learning Spanish!

Talking about the weather in Spanish also makes it incredibly easy to practice speaking. There will never be a time you can’t look out the window and describe the weather out loud. You can ask your language exchange partner what the weather is like where he or she lives. In fact, a lot of <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/italki-review/">online tutors</a> and language exchange partners that I’ve used start a conversation by asking about the weather. And you can even set up Google to recognize Spanish and ask it for today’s forecast. Then you’ll get listening and speaking practice, too!

Learning how to talk about the weather is usually among my first topics to learn in a new language. Because when I travel, it will always save me from awkward pauses. If I don’t know what else to say I can throw in something about the weather, and the conversation sparks up again. Especially in most Spanish-speaking countries, where the weather can rapidly change or have extreme conditions. Everyone’s willing to vent a little about the too-hot days, or a rapid cold snap.

So let’s learn how to talk about the easiest of conversation starters: the weather in Spanish.
<h2 id="spanishweathervocab">Spanish Weather Vocab</h2>
First, let’s learn the words that describe the weather. There are many weather conditions you could talk about, and a lot of words to go with them. But, there are common themes and ways to memorize them, which I’ll talk about in a moment.
<h3 id="spanishweathernouns">Spanish Weather Nouns:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Weather: <em>el tiempo</em> or <em>el clima</em></li>
 	<li>Sun: <em>el sol</em></li>
 	<li>Clouds: <em>las nubes</em></li>
 	<li>Rain: <em>la lluvia</em></li>
 	<li>Thunder: <em>el trueno</em></li>
 	<li>Lightning: <em>el relámpago</em></li>
 	<li>Fog: <em>la niebla</em></li>
 	<li>Snow: <em>la nieve</em></li>
 	<li>Wind: <em>el viento</em></li>
 	<li>Storm: <em>la tormenta</em></li>
 	<li>Sleet: <em>las aguanieve</em></li>
 	<li>Frost: <em>la helada</em></li>
 	<li>Hail: <em>el granizo</em></li>
 	<li>Rainbow: <em>los arco iris</em></li>
 	<li>Breeze: <em>la brisa</em></li>
 	<li>Temperature: <em>la temperatura</em></li>
 	<li>Degrees: <em>los grados</em></li>
 	<li>Season: <em>la temporada</em></li>
 	<li>Spring: <em>la primavera</em></li>
 	<li>Summer: <em>el verano</em></li>
 	<li>Fall: <em>el otoño</em></li>
 	<li>Winter: <em>el invierno</em></li>
</ul>
Note: The word <em>tiempo</em> (“weather”) has many different meanings in Spanish, including “time”, “tempo” and “grammar tense”. So if you want to be clear, you can use <em>clima</em>. That means both “climate” and “weather”. Unlike the English word “climate”, <em>clima</em> can be used to describe current weather, not just the general weather of an area.
<h3 id="spanishweatheradjectives">Spanish Weather Adjectives:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Sunny: <em>soleado</em></li>
 	<li>Cloudy: <em>nublado</em></li>
 	<li>Windy: <em>ventoso</em></li>
 	<li>Misty: <em>neblina</em></li>
 	<li>Foggy: <em>niebla</em></li>
 	<li>Clear: <em>despejado</em></li>
 	<li>Bad weather: <em>mal tiempo</em></li>
 	<li>Good weather: <em>buen tiempo</em></li>
 	<li>Hot: <em>calor</em></li>
 	<li>Cold: <em>frío.</em></li>
 	<li>Warm: <em>cálido</em></li>
 	<li>Cool: <em>fresco</em></li>
 	<li>Humid: <em>húmedo</em></li>
 	<li>Bitter cold or freezing: <em>glacial</em></li>
 	<li>Chilly: <em>friolero</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spanishweatherverbs">Spanish Weather Verbs:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Shining: <em>brillando</em></li>
 	<li>Raining: <em>lloviendo</em></li>
 	<li>Snowing: <em>nevando</em></li>
 	<li>Storming: <em>asaltando</em></li>
 	<li>Sleeting: <em>agobiante</em></li>
 	<li>Drizzling: <em>llovizna</em></li>
 	<li>Pouring: <em>torrencial</em></li>
 	<li>Hailing: <em>llamando</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spanishwordsforextremeweatherconditions">Spanish Words for Extreme Weather Conditions:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Hailstorm: <em>la granizada</em></li>
 	<li>Hurricane: <em>el huracán</em></li>
 	<li>Tornado: <em>el tornado</em></li>
 	<li>Blizzard: <em>la tormenta de nieve</em></li>
 	<li>Earthquake: <em>el terremoto</em></li>
 	<li>Flood: <em>la inundación</em></li>
 	<li>Windstorm: <em>la tormenta de viento</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtomemorisespanishweatherwords">How to Memorise Spanish Weather Words</h2>
You’re probably thinking that I’ve shared a lot of Spanish weather words, and you’re wondering how you can memorise so many words. Thankfully there are some simple memory hacks you can use.
<h3 id="memoryhack1lookforspanishweathercognates">Memory Hack 1: Look for Spanish Weather Cognates</h3>
Some Spanish weather words are cognates, which means they resemble their English counterpart in some way. This makes them easier to remember!

These are words like <em>sol</em> for “sun”, which is similar to “solar”. Or <em>el huracán</em>, which is almost the same as “hurricane”.

Others, like <em>glacial</em> and <em>torrencial</em> are similar to how we describe a glacial cold or torrential downpour. <em>Terremoto</em> resembles both “tremble” and “terrestrial”, meaning the earth trembles. And <em>aguanieve</em>, which is “sleet”, describes the exact state of the weather: a mix of water (<em>agua</em>) and snow (<em>nieve</em>).
<h3 id="memoryhack2lookforpatterns">Memory Hack 2: Look for Patterns</h3>
Most Spanish weather words relating to rain start with “lla”. And words relating to snow start with “nie” or “ne”.
<h3 id="memoryhack3focusyourenergies">Memory Hack 3: Focus Your Energies</h3>
Instead of trying to learn all the Spanish weather words at once, focus on those you’re most likely to use in real conversations. For example, since I’m from Ireland, when I’m talking about the weather of my home country I’ll talk about <em>la lluvia</em> (“the rain”) a lot, so that’s an important word for me to know.
<h3 id="memoryhack4usewhatyouvelearnedinrealconversations">Memory Hack 4: Use What You’ve Learned in Real Conversations</h3>
My number one tip for learning a new language is to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/tedx/">Speak from Day One</a>. This will build your confidence, and cement what you’ve learned into your memory.

If you’d like to do this, I recommend booking a sessions with a <a href="https://fluentin3months.com/italki">Spanish italki tutor</a>. For complete beginners, I recommend starting with my free <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/join/">Speak in a Week</a> course.
<h2 id="talkingabouttheweatherinspanishhelpingverbs">Talking about the Weather in Spanish: Helping Verbs</h2>
In Spanish, you almost always need helping verbs to talk about the weather. There are three verbs you’ll use: <em>hacer</em>, <em>estar</em> and <em>haber</em>.

It may seem a bit strange to use phrases that literally translate as “The weather makes rain,” or “There is weather.” But that’s just how it works in Spanish.

There are only a handful of exceptions to this rule. Very common weather conditions have been simplified to single words. They are:
<ul>
 	<li>It rains: <em>llueve</em></li>
 	<li>It drizzles: <em>llovizna</em></li>
 	<li>It snows: <em>nieva</em></li>
 	<li>It thunders: <em>truena</em></li>
</ul>
You can simply say these on their own, and they make sense. For example, looking out the window and commenting, “<em>Llueve</em>”.
<h3 id="helpingverb1hacertheweatherdoesormakes">Helping Verb 1: <em>Hacer</em> -- The Weather “Does” or “Makes”</h3>
The Spanish verb <em>hacer</em> pairs with most words to talk about the weather. Although we normally translate this as “to make”, in this case the more natural English translation would be “it is”.

So what does the weather “make”?
<ul>
 	<li>It’s hot: <em>Hace calor</em></li>
 	<li>It’s cold: <em>Hace frío</em></li>
 	<li>It’s nice weather: <em>Hace buen tiempo</em></li>
 	<li>It’s very bad weather: <em>Hace muy mal tiempo</em></li>
 	<li>It’s sunny: <em>Hace sol</em></li>
</ul>
<em>Hacer</em> is usually used to describe the feeling of the weather, so you can think of it like “It makes it feel hot” or “It makes it feel cold.” You pair <em>hacer</em> with descriptive words about the feeling of the weather outside.
<h3 id="helpingverb2estartheweatheris">Helping Verb 2: <em>Estar</em> -- The Weather “is”</h3>
When referring to the weather, <em>estar</em> takes on the third person form, <em>está</em>. Which makes sense - you’re not talking about yourself, or another person, but an “it”. <em>Estar</em> is the verb for “to be” when it’s not permanent, so don’t confuse it with <em>ser</em> (permanent “to be”).

<em>Estar</em> can be used with both verbs and adjectives to describe the current condition.
<ul>
 	<li>It’s raining very hard: <em>Está lloviendo muy fuerte</em></li>
 	<li>It’s sunny: <em>Está soleado</em></li>
 	<li>It’s stormy: <em>Está tormentoso</em></li>
 	<li>It’s very humid: <em>Está muy húmedo</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="helpingverb3haberthereisweather">Helping Verb 3: <em>Haber</em>: “There is” Weather</h3>
<em>Haber</em> is used as <em>hay</em> when talking about the weather, and it’s mostly for factual statements such as “There is a hurricane” or “There is a storm”.

It’s usually translated as “it is”. For instance, “It is foggy” is <em>Hay niebla</em>. Literally, “There is fog.” <em>Hay</em> is most often paired with the noun form of the weather.
<ul>
 	<li>It’s stormy: <em>Hay tormenta</em></li>
 	<li>There’s a flood: <em>Hay una inundación</em></li>
 	<li>There’s rain: <em>Hay lluvia</em></li>
 	<li>It’s windy: <em>Hay viento</em></li>
 	<li>There’s snow: <em>Hay nieve</em></li>
</ul>
It can be a bit confusing to get used to which helping verb to use. If you think of <em>hacer</em> for adjectives, <em>estar</em> for verbs and <em>haber</em> for nouns, you’ll usually get it right.
<h2 id="askingabouttheweatherinspanish">Asking about the Weather in Spanish</h2>
Okay, we know how to say some basic things about the current weather. But how do we ask others?

When you want to ask about the weather outside, or in someone else’s area, here are some phrases you can use:
<ul>
 	<li>What’s the weather like today?: <em>¿Qué tiempo hace hoy?</em></li>
 	<li>How is the weather today?: <em>¿Cómo está el clima hoy?</em> or <em>¿Cómo está el tiempo hoy?</em></li>
 	<li>What’s it like outside?: <em>¿Cómo es afuera?</em> or <em>¿Cómo está por fuera?</em></li>
 	<li>What’s the weather like in ?: *¿Cómo es el clima en ?*</li>
 	<li>Is it cold outside?: <em>¿Hace frío afuera?</em></li>
 	<li>Is it raining outside?: <em>¿Está lloviendo afuera?</em></li>
 	<li>Is there snow?: <em>¿Hay nieve?</em></li>
</ul>
So you can see how to turn phrases with <em>hacer</em>, <em>estar</em> and <em>haber</em> into questions.
<h2 id="spanishweatherphrases">Spanish Weather Phrases</h2>
We have quite a few English idioms about weather. The most famous example is probably “it’s raining cats and dogs,” or “it’s pouring buckets.” Spanish has phrases like that, too. You’ll also want to know how to ask someone how the weather makes them feel, or how to describe your own feelings.
<h3 id="commonspanishweatherphrases">Common Spanish Weather Phrases</h3>
A few popular idiomatic phrases are <em>Llueve a mares</em> (“It’s raining the seas”), which is closest to “it’s raining cats and dogs.” You could also describe heavy rains with <em>Llueve a cántaros</em>, or “It’s raining jugs.”

To talk about how cold it is, you might say <em>Hace un frío que pela</em>. It translates to “it’s so cold, it burns,” but it means “It’s freezing!” And for heat, you can use <em>Hace un calor tremendo</em> (“It makes a tremendous heat.”)

In springtime, you can say <em>La primavera, la sangre altera</em>, or “Spring alters blood.” It just means that you can feel in the air that spring is coming.

There’s also the idiom, <em>Siempre que llovió, paró</em> which translates to “Every time it rained, it stopped,” or “This too will pass.”
<h3 id="spanishphrasestodescribehowtheweathermakesyoufeel">Spanish Phrases to Describe How the Weather Makes You Feel</h3>
Usually, when making small talk about the weather, you discuss how it makes you feel. “<em>Hace un calor tremendo</em>!” would be followed with <em>Lo sé. Estoy sudando como un pollo!</em> (“I know. I’m sweating like a chicken!”)

If you want to ask how someone’s feeling, you can say <em>¿Tienes ____?</em> For instance, “Are you feeling hot?” would be <em>¿Tienes calor?</em> To which they might respond, <em>Si, tengo calor.</em>

Here are a few other Spanish weather words and phrases to know:
<ul>
 	<li>Burning up: <em>quemando</em></li>
 	<li>Dying of heat: <em>muero de calor</em></li>
 	<li>Sweaty: <em>sudoroso</em> or <em>sudorosa</em></li>
 	<li>Really cold: <em>mucho frio</em></li>
 	<li>Freezing: <em>congelando</em></li>
 	<li>It’s an oven outside: <em>Es un horno afuera</em></li>
 	<li>It’s an icebox outside: <em>Es una nevera fuera</em></li>
 	<li>Cool as a cucumber: <em>Más fresco que una lechuga</em> (Literally: “Cooler than lettuce”)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="masteringspanishweathersmalltalk">Mastering Spanish Weather Small Talk</h2>
Now it’s over to you! Practice these expressions to describe your daily weather, and you’ll be prepared for small talk in any situation. You can also look up the weather in Spanish, and listen to the forecast or read about it. That will help instil how native speakers hear and talk about the weather. You could even use <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/language-learning-instagram/">Instagram to boost your language skills</a> and search for things like “#tiempo” or “#clima”.

If you’re ready to move on to other icebreakers to keep the conversation flowing, make sure to <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/spanish-questions/">master your questions to ask about others</a>. You can even learn about the other universal small talk topic: <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/food-in-spanish/">Spanish food culture and vocab</a>.

<p>As the Head Coach for <a href="http://add1challenge.com"><em>Add1</em></a>, I have the opportunity to watch thousands of language learners do incredible things as they push themselves to learn a new language in just 90 days..</p>
<p>Every time I lead an <em>Add1</em>, it gives me a thrill of excitement to see our students achieve a 15-minute conversation at the end of <em>Add1</em>.</p>
<p>One <em>Add1</em> student whose results really stuck in my mind was Heather Snodgrass, who joined <em>Add1</em> because she wanted to commit to learning Italian, and actually use the language in real conversations.</p>
<p>I met up with Heather (over a video call) and asked her to share her <em>Add1</em> journey. She was incredibly open in what she shared, and she told me:</p>
<ul>
<li>How she found an inner drive to learn Italian (it all started with a short film)</li>
<li>The language learning strategies Heather applied to reach a 21-minute conversation in Italian after 90 days</li>
<li>The exact tools Heather used to develop her Italian skills</li>
<li>What Heather loved about creating videos for <em>Add1</em> (plus what she found difficult about making the videos)</li>
<li>How Heather dealt with difficult life situations that came up while she was learning Italian with <em>Add1</em></li>
<li>Heather’s biggest takeaway from completing <em>Add1</em>, plus her advice for new <em>Add1</em> students.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can watch the video below. First here’s what Heather achieved with <em>Add1</em>:</p>

<h2 id="heathersadd1story">Heather’s Add1 Story</h2>
<p>You can hear Heather’s story in her own words here [edited transcript below]:</p>
<p>httpvh://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWpH860Zw4U</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Kennedy: Heather, why don't you take a moment to introduce yourself, let us know what language you studied as a part of the <em>Add1Challenge</em>, and why you picked that language.</strong></p>
<p>Heather Snodgrass: My name is Heather Snodgrass. I'm 38 years old, I'm from the United States. For the <em>Add1Challenge</em> I studied Italian... I just remember a few years ago for an Indigogo campaign there was a short film which in English was “The Night Shift Belongs to the Stars.” It was partly in Italian, partly in English, and I met the director, Edoardo Ponti, and some of the producers. And at the time, I knew maybe two words in Italian. And one of the producers jokingly says "You have to learn Italian now." Challenge accepted. That was several years ago, so I decided to make good on that.</p>
<h2 id="howheathersucceededinlearningitalianin90dayswithadd1">How Heather Succeeded in Learning Italian in 90 Days With Add1</h2>
<p><strong>SK: When you started doing the challenge, what was your approach? What were you expecting to do and how did you think you were going to participate in the challenge?</strong></p>
<p>HS: Originally, when I did it, I thought okay, I could find some sources. I can go through the material. I can speak when I need to. Wrong. Doesn't work like that. Speaking is the number one thing in this challenge. You really do have to speak a little bit each day. You can't just say "I'll do it tomorrow, I'll do it tomorrow." No. You have to do it now because when it comes time to do that 15-minute conversation, you need to be able to speak. You can't just sit there and “uh and um” for 15 minutes. Ninety days... that's plenty of time to be able to find someone to have a conversation with, and maybe you wanna decide a certain topic to talk about instead of just sitting there talking about the weather and other mundane things.</p>
<h2 id="theexacttoolsheatherusedtoimproveheritalianduringadd1">The Exact Tools Heather Used to Improve Her Italian During Add1</h2>
<p><strong>SK: What were some of the things that you did in the challenge that you thought worked really well?</strong></p>
<p>HS: I took lessons <strong>twice a week</strong>. I went on <a href="http://fluentin3months.com/italki-review"><em>italki</em></a>. Toward the end, I picked up a little bit. Beyond that, I didn't really do anything different than I would normally do. I just wrote in a journal, I found some songs I really like to be able to hear the language, I looked for different podcasts. There was one thing called <em>Coffee Break Italian</em>, which is a little different than other podcasts because you have a teacher, you have a native speaker, and then you have somebody who's learning along with you. That person makes mistakes at times, so it's not totally scripted. It was really nice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finding the time to do it <strong>was no problem</strong>. It was finding the commitment to do it.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="howheatherdealtwithstagefrightwhenmakingvideosinitalian">How Heather Dealt with Stage Fright When Making Videos in Italian</h2>
<p><em>Note: For Add1, students create videos of themselves speaking their target language on Day 0, 30, 60 and 90. The Day 90 video is a recording of them having a 15-minute conversation with a native speaker.</em></p>
<p><strong>SK: Let's talk about creating videos. How did you feel before creating them, and then after you had created them, and then as far as your progress between zero to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90?</strong></p>
<p>HS: Well, the hardest video is the first one, I think, especially if you're not used to doing videos.</p>
<p>There is that bit of stage fright. I have to just kinda soldier through that, but after the first video, it can get addicting. You do a benchmark video and then you kind of want to do other little sub-videos. Maybe where you're counting, or you maybe I don't know, have a grocery list and you want to read it out loud, so you just to put it out there and people can listen to it.</p>
<h2 id="theemotionalchallengesofadd1">The Emotional Challenges of Add1</h2>
<p><strong>SK: You had mentioned that you went on a trip during the <em>Add1Challenge</em>, but as far as other hurdles that might have affected your study and your progress what did you face? And what did you do to overcome them?</strong></p>
<p>HS: My oldest cat actually died right in the middle of the challenge and so that was very rough. I'd had that cat since just before I turned 17. I'm 38 now. With that, I had to kind of step back for a couple of days, and deal with that… I can't really remember what I did. I know that it happened on a Thursday, and for a while Thursday was kind of like a designated break day. I might just do five minutes of <em>Duolingo</em>, just to do something.</p>
<h2 id="heathersday90videothe21minuteconversationinitalian">Heather’s Day 90 Video (The 21-Minute Conversation in Italian)</h2>
<p><strong>SK: Let's talk about your day 90 video in particular. Tell me a little bit about what you were expecting going into it, and how it actually went, and some of the things that you talked about in your video.</strong></p>
<p>HS: My day 90 video, I was stressing about that probably from day one, as you do. I ended up recording the video with my tutor which was the best option because we'd worked together for most of that time, so we could feed off of each other. We were talking about what I could do and have a real topic that I could talk about so she could ask questions and what not. Originally, there was one topic I was going to do. I won't mention it because I'll probably do it for a later challenge. Then I got to looking it and I was like "I think this might be a bit too big right now." So I put it on the back burner and I decided to talk about my trip. London, in general, and the delays... there were so many delays on that trip it's even not funny. I could laugh about it now, but at the time, no.</p>
<p>I talked about my trip, what I did, and things like that. Before I knew it when I cut the camera off, it was 21 minutes long. So I'm like "No way, no way that was 21 minutes." I purposely didn’t look at the counter.</p>
<h2 id="biggesttakeawayifyoudontuseityouloseit">Biggest Takeaway: “If You Don’t Use It, You Lose It”</h2>
<p><strong>SK: What would you say your biggest challenge is after the <em>Add1Challenge</em>? What was your biggest takeaway?</strong></p>
<p>HS: The biggest takeaway ... if you don't use it you lose it. That's with really anything in life. At the present moment, I'm still taking lessons once a week to keep up the language there, and learn a little bit. I do plan to do the next challenge coming up. I haven't decided if I'm going to do Italian again or not, or if I'm going to do something else, just to give myself a little bit of a break. You don't do the challenge and go "Whoop, I'm done with that" and then not do it again and expect to retain the knowledge. It doesn't work like that.</p>
<h2 id="heatherstoptipsforadd1students">Heather’s Top Tips for Add1 Students</h2>
<p><strong>SK: What would your advice be to someone who's just starting the <em>Add1Challenge</em>?</strong></p>
<p>HS: Speak every day, even if it's just five minutes to yourself. A lot of times I did because, <strong>for example</strong>, our third mini challenge was to log total speaking time. I use music a lot because that was kinda the focus of my lessons, which paid off for me. That's really it, is to go all in. It's going to be a lot of work with the mini-challenges, but try your best to do them.</p>
<p>Be involved in the community. Just get to know your people. It's not a race, it's not a contest. It's okay to have friendly competition, which I did.</p>
<p>If you have a big fail one day, that's okay. Just pick yourself up and try again tomorrow. You have to put in the time.</p>
<p>Embrace the suck, because that's how it's gonna be. You're going to be terrible at the beginning. That's just how it is. There are days that I will forget how to English, as I say. There will be a lot of times that you'll just say something, then looking back you say, "What? That doesn't make any sense," even though it did at the time. But that's part of it. Learning from your mistakes.</p>

Every time I lead an <em>Add1</em>, it gives me a thrill of excitement to see our students achieve a 15-minute conversation at the end of <em>Add1</em>.

One <em>Add1</em> student whose results really stuck in my mind was Heather Snodgrass, who joined <em>Add1</em> because she wanted to commit to learning Italian, and actually use the language in real conversations.

I met up with Heather (over a video call) and asked her to share her <em>Add1</em> journey. She was incredibly open in what she shared, and she told me:
<ul>
 	<li>How she found an inner drive to learn Italian (it all started with a short film)</li>
 	<li>The language learning strategies Heather applied to reach a 21-minute conversation in Italian after 90 days</li>
 	<li>The exact tools Heather used to develop her Italian skills</li>
 	<li>What Heather loved about creating videos for <em>Add1</em> (plus what she found difficult about making the videos)</li>
 	<li>How Heather dealt with difficult life situations that came up while she was learning Italian with <em>Add1</em></li>
 	<li>Heather’s biggest takeaway from completing <em>Add1</em>, plus her advice for new <em>Add1</em> students.</li>
</ul>
You can watch the video below. First here’s what Heather achieved with <em>Add1</em>:

<strong>Shannon Kennedy: Heather, why don't you take a moment to introduce yourself, let us know what language you studied as a part of the <em>Add1Challenge</em>, and why you picked that language.</strong>

Heather Snodgrass: My name is Heather Snodgrass. I'm 38 years old, I'm from the United States. For the <em>Add1Challenge</em> I studied Italian... I just remember a few years ago for an Indigogo campaign there was a short film which in English was “The Night Shift Belongs to the Stars.” It was partly in Italian, partly in English, and I met the director, Edoardo Ponti, and some of the producers. And at the time, I knew maybe two words in Italian. And one of the producers jokingly says "You have to learn Italian now." Challenge accepted. That was several years ago, so I decided to make good on that.

<strong>SK: When you started doing the challenge, what was your approach? What were you expecting to do and how did you think you were going to participate in the challenge?</strong>

HS: Originally, when I did it, I thought okay, I could find some sources. I can go through the material. I can speak when I need to. Wrong. Doesn't work like that. Speaking is the number one thing in this challenge. You really do have to speak a little bit each day. You can't just say "I'll do it tomorrow, I'll do it tomorrow." No. You have to do it now because when it comes time to do that 15-minute conversation, you need to be able to speak. You can't just sit there and “uh and um” for 15 minutes. Ninety days... that's plenty of time to be able to find someone to have a conversation with, and maybe you wanna decide a certain topic to talk about instead of just sitting there talking about the weather and other mundane things.

<strong>SK: What were some of the things that you did in the challenge that you thought worked really well?</strong>

HS: I took lessons <strong>twice a week</strong>. I went on <a href="http://fluentin3months.com/italki-review"><em>italki</em></a>. Toward the end, I picked up a little bit. Beyond that, I didn't really do anything different than I would normally do. I just wrote in a journal, I found some songs I really like to be able to hear the language, I looked for different podcasts. There was one thing called <em>Coffee Break Italian</em>, which is a little different than other podcasts because you have a teacher, you have a native speaker, and then you have somebody who's learning along with you. That person makes mistakes at times, so it's not totally scripted. It was really nice.
<blockquote>Finding the time to do it <strong>was no problem</strong>. It was finding the commitment to do it.</blockquote>
<h2 id="howheatherdealtwithstagefrightwhenmakingvideosinitalian">How Heather Dealt with Stage Fright When Making Videos in Italian</h2>
<em>Note: For Add1, students create videos of themselves speaking their target language on Day 0, 30, 60 and 90. The Day 90 video is a recording of them having a 15-minute conversation with a native speaker.</em>

<strong>SK: Let's talk about creating videos. How did you feel before creating them, and then after you had created them, and then as far as your progress between zero to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90?</strong>

HS: Well, the hardest video is the first one, I think, especially if you're not used to doing videos.

There is that bit of stage fright. I have to just kinda soldier through that, but after the first video, it can get addicting. You do a benchmark video and then you kind of want to do other little sub-videos. Maybe where you're counting, or you maybe I don't know, have a grocery list and you want to read it out loud, so you just to put it out there and people can listen to it.
<h2 id="theemotionalchallengesofadd1">The Emotional Challenges of Add1</h2>
<strong>SK: You had mentioned that you went on a trip during the <em>Add1Challenge</em>, but as far as other hurdles that might have affected your study and your progress what did you face? And what did you do to overcome them?</strong>

HS: My oldest cat actually died right in the middle of the challenge and so that was very rough. I'd had that cat since just before I turned 17. I'm 38 now. With that, I had to kind of step back for a couple of days, and deal with that… I can't really remember what I did. I know that it happened on a Thursday, and for a while Thursday was kind of like a designated break day. I might just do five minutes of <em>Duolingo</em>, just to do something.
<h2 id="heathersday90videothe21minuteconversationinitalian">Heather’s Day 90 Video (The 21-Minute Conversation in Italian)</h2>
<strong>SK: Let's talk about your day 90 video in particular. Tell me a little bit about what you were expecting going into it, and how it actually went, and some of the things that you talked about in your video.</strong>

HS: My day 90 video, I was stressing about that probably from day one, as you do. I ended up recording the video with my tutor which was the best option because we'd worked together for most of that time, so we could feed off of each other. We were talking about what I could do and have a real topic that I could talk about so she could ask questions and what not. Originally, there was one topic I was going to do. I won't mention it because I'll probably do it for a later challenge. Then I got to looking it and I was like "I think this might be a bit too big right now." So I put it on the back burner and I decided to talk about my trip. London, in general, and the delays... there were so many delays on that trip it's even not funny. I could laugh about it now, but at the time, no.

I talked about my trip, what I did, and things like that. Before I knew it when I cut the camera off, it was 21 minutes long. So I'm like "No way, no way that was 21 minutes." I purposely didn’t look at the counter.

Be involved in the community. Just get to know your people. It's not a race, it's not a contest. It's okay to have friendly competition, which I did.

If you have a big fail one day, that's okay. Just pick yourself up and try again tomorrow. You have to put in the time.

Embrace the suck, because that's how it's gonna be. You're going to be terrible at the beginning. That's just how it is. There are days that I will forget how to English, as I say. There will be a lot of times that you'll just say something, then looking back you say, "What? That doesn't make any sense," even though it did at the time. But that's part of it.
