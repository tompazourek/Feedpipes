<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/U9A4674Blog.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-32227"/><figcaption>Anna Tasca Flower and Herb Garden, Case Vecchie</figcaption></figure>



<p>I am super pleased to announce that I am returning to Case Vecchie, <a href="https://www.annatascalanza.com/">Anna Tasca Lanza Cooking School,</a> to co-teach a <strong>5 day food styling and photography workshop</strong> this coming fall with my friend <a href="https://www.annatascalanza.com/fabrizia-lanza/">Fabrizia</a>, owner of the school.<br><br>The workshop is held <strong>September 16 to 21, 2019.</strong></p>



<p>At <strong>Case Vecchie</strong> (located in Vallelunga) and in <strong>Sicily</strong>, the opportunities for strong pictures are everywhere. With its magical light, its people and atmospheric landscapes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/D0C3421.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-32277"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/D0C3592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-32282"/><figcaption>Case Vecchie</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you are not familiar with the area, <strong>Case Vecchie</strong> is located in Vallelunga, amongst picturesque Sicilian countryside, at less than 2 hours south east of Palermo . The cooking school is surrounded by rolling hills and vines&#8211;this is where <a href="https://www.tascadalmerita.it/en/estate/regaleali/">Tasca d&#8217;Almerita Regaleali wines</a> come from too. So if you are looking for quietness and slow pace, farmland and hills and olive trees, this is the place to be.</p>



<p>We want you to have a unique Sicilian experience filled with amazing food and rich encounters.</p>



<p>Next to <strong>food styling and photography</strong> sessions, you will learn about, and <strong>cook</strong>, authentic <strong>Sicilian food</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG-20190228-WA0004-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-32291"/><figcaption>Kitchen at Case Vecchie</figcaption></figure>



<p>You will also learn how to use your camera to become a better <strong>food photographer</strong>, how to style food with <strong>hands on assignments</strong>, and how to create pictures that tell a story.</p>



<p>A Sicilian story.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/D0C4267.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-32242"/><figcaption>Around Case Vecchie in Spring</figcaption></figure>

<p>Fabrizia&#8217;s <strong>flower and vegetable garden</strong>&#8211;it is magnificent&#8211;will provide the gorgeous produce we will utilize: you cannot get more local then this! <br><br>We will also make <strong>local excursions</strong>&#8211;such as visit a <strong>ricotta making farm</strong>&#8211;to learn about <strong>food traditions</strong>, and how to best utilize light and camera settings on location.</p>

<p>And while all of this is happening, you will also be able to take fulfilling walks on the scenic<strong> hills</strong> that surround the school&#8211;be prepared for the stupendous views&#8211;or/and <strong>rest</strong> and <strong>relax</strong> by the marvelous <strong>pool</strong>.</p>

<div class="photolabel"><em>Apple Crumble</em></div>
<p>The arrival of fall makes me jump and dance. Growing up in the northeastern part of France surely has a lot to do with it. Maybe because it announces a more quiet time of year with fewer activities, less noise, less heat, and peaceful afternoons and evenings enjoying crispy days outside and cosy ones inside. </p>
<p>Fall is by far my favorite season.</p>
<p>For its beautiful <strong>root vegetables</strong>. The smells found in the forest.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/S7I1632.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32057" /></p>
<div class="photolabel"><em>Fall Root Vegetable Box</em></div>
<p>And its <strong>apples</strong>! </p>
<p>I can easily say that I am an apple lover.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/D0C2880pommes.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32060" /></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s just natural that I am constantly looking forward to visiting <strong>apple orchards</strong> at this time of year, and by luck there are oh so many pretty ones in New England where we live.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/D0C2847-Editapples.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32064" /></p>
<p><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/S7I1517apples.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32066" /></p>
<p>We went apple picking a few weeks ago with friends and since then, I must have cooked at least 3 or 4 times this apple crumble recipe. As soon as the dessert is gone, my family asks for more&#8211;and when they are nice with me, I even heat milk in a pot that I infuse with <strong>vanilla</strong>, I separate <strong>eggs</strong> and mix them with a little sugar to prepare a pot of <strong><em>crème anglaise</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>It&#8217;s your Irish grand father&#8217;s and great grand father Billy&#8217;s favorite!</em>&#8221; Philip always likes to remind Lulu and Rémy when we eat custard.</p>
<p>Rather than eat it, they prefer to drink it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how much custard&#8211;with apple crumble&#8211;is loved in our household. </p>
<p>Give it a try!</p>

<p>Hello everyone! So happy to be returning today (after such a long time, I know&#8230;..), especially because I came to share a project I&#8217;ve been working on for a few months now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good reason!</p>
<p>In conjunction with <strong><a href="https://www.saffrongatherers.com/">Saffron Gatherers</a></strong>, I am announcing that I will be holding two beautiful retreats in Greece this fall.</p>
<p>Have you always dreamt of spending time to explore and photograph the blues and whites and the nooks and corners of a <strong>Greek island</strong>? I have! And I cannot wait to be able to make this adventure happen and take you there with me.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s, shall we?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8.serifos-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="806" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31919" /></p>

Serifos Chora&#8211;Coco Mat Eco Residences<br />
(Photo credit: from top to bottom; left to right: Istock; Coco Mat Eco)</em></div>
<p>Join me for a fabulous <strong><a href="https://www.saffrongatherers.com/event/simple-miracles-a-table-facing-the-aegean-blue/">five day retreat</a></strong> (2 set of dates to choose from) staying at the beautiful residences <a href="https://serifos.coco-mat-hotels.com/en/">Coco &#8211; Mat Eco</a> on the exceptional island of <strong>Serifos</strong> in <strong>Greece</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31814" src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/serifos10.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="353" /></p>
<div class="photolabel"><em>Serifos Coastline<br />
(Photo credit: IStock)</em></div>
<p><strong>Coco Mat Eco residences</strong> are houses built in respect of both local traditional architecture and contemporary eco friendly practices. The lodgings are simply stunning. Located by the lovely <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vagia+beach+serifos&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBz7X2_PrZAhVGmeAKHe2BDfYQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1721&amp;bih=1213">Vagià beach</a></strong>, the hotel invites you to ease up and slow down, and enjoy an authentic<strong> Cycladic experience</strong> away from the hassle of tourists.</p>
<p>In this retreat, we will embrace this splendid setting by the beach, and gather for <strong>food styling and photography sessions</strong> and inspiring local activities (<strong>cooking, pottery making</strong>) and <strong>touring</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/serifos4-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="810" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31891" /></p>
<div class="photolabel"><em>Serifos&#8211;Béa&#8217;s styled food<br />

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31793" src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rootsserifos.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<div class="photolabel"><em>(Photo credit: Béatrice Peltre)</em></div>
<p>During our time together, we will discuss <strong>DSLR camera basics</strong> (ISO, aperture, speed, and white balance, all camera knowledge to use during the entire retreat if you are not yet familiar with the basics), <strong>light</strong>, <strong>composition</strong>, and <strong>styling</strong>. </p>
<p>I will take you through the process of utilizing <strong>natural light</strong> (especially <strong>warm</strong> and photogenic in Greece in September) to create a composition and photograph food images with the mood you envision. </p>
<p>You will learn:<br />
* <strong>fundamentals of styling food</strong> thanks to hands-on sessions using beautiful local produce; </p>
<p>* the <strong>tricks of the trade</strong> to overcome technical challenges to make an image; </p>
<p>* how to choose the right <strong>props</strong> to create images that tell the story you want. </p>
<p>We will also discuss how important it is to bring the human element in a photo to give it life and movement. </p>
<p>When we tour and visit the island, you will have plenty of opportunity to practice <strong>landscape photography</strong>, and then <strong>action shots</strong> when we cook together.  </p>
<p>We will cover <strong>photo editing</strong>, and go through a traditional <strong>workflow using Lightroom and Photoshop</strong>&#8211;an important step with an image to eventually define your style and brand. </p>
<p>And finally, we will take time to reflect and share feedback about the images you will have created, so that you are able to benefit from each other&#8217;s creative eye. This is always a beloved time of the retreats I&#8217;ve led in the past as collaborative work is key to progress.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D0C4528_Salad.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31971" /> </p>
<p>In between all of it, you will also <strong>swim</strong>, <strong>relax</strong>, take in the slow pace of Greek life, <strong>make pottery</strong>, <strong>ride a bike</strong> if you want, and <strong>photograph</strong> and photograph, more and more.</p>
<p>The choice of this retreat is meant to offer the opportunity to better your photographic skills and take beautiful photographs to enrich your personal portfolio. To feed your passions. We hope you will leave inspired and enriched with new friendships too.</p>
<p>We all need bits of this in the crazy pace of life and our current world, <em>non?</em></p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>So&#8230;&#8230;if you are interested in one of <a href="https://www.saffrongatherers.com/event/simple-miracles-a-table-facing-the-aegean-blue/">these two retreats</a> (September is also one of the best times to visit Greece), read on as the details about the contents&#8211;and many interspersed pictures of the hotel and accommodation&#8211;and the registration process follow below.</p>

<strong>ITINERARY DETAILS</strong></strong></div>
<p><strong>DAY ONE: Arrival day at COCO &#8211; MAT ECO RESIDENCES IN SERIFOS</strong></p>
<p>According to the current ferry schedule, arrival at the port of Serifos will be between 6:30 and 7:00 PM. We will meet you at the ferry and drive together to Vagià bay located just 6.5 km / 4 miles from the port (10 minutes).<br />
Distances in Serifos are rather short and we won&#8217;t need more than 35 minutes to travel even to the most remote places of the island during the retreat.<br />
Arrival at Coco-Mat Eco Residences and room allocation. Welcome drinks at the reception and dinner at the hotel to get to know each other and feel the aura of the place.<br />
<strong>Travel tip: </strong><em>Please ensure that your flight to Athens arrives no later than 1:30 p.m. today. If you prefer to arrive one day in advance, we can recommend a central hotel to make a reservation. There are a lot of things to do in Athens if you arrive early. You may visit the Parthenon and the Acropolis Museum, wander through Plaka, Syntagma, Thissio, Monastiraki -the historical center of Athens- or take a Square Walking Tour with a professional guide, while at the end of the day you can enjoy your dinner in an open-air restaurant. This could also be the perfect opportunity for you to visit Greece and the Cyclades. Hop on a boat and visit more islands. If you’re looking for a hotel, we can recommend some great options. Ask us for advice on what to do on the island.</em></p>
<p><strong>DAY TWO: FOOD STYLING &amp; PHOTOGRAPHY SESSION &#8211; 1</strong></p>
<p>After breakfast at the hotel we will start with a first food styling &amp; photography session, introducing the basics about how to use your camera (DSLR) manually. Béa will guide you through her typical workflow to build a food image. We will have a variety of surfaces, props, fabrics, and local produce at our disposal for the session.<br />
After lunch at the hotel, we will take a rest to enjoy the crystal clear waters of Vagià beach in front of our hotel. Later on we will drive to Chora to visit the castle at the top and walk in the alleys among the chalk-white houses in order to capture the elusive golden hour, when light is red-orange and soft -a brief window of time elsewhere but long in Greece. The view from Chora and the light before and during the sunset is unique and every minute is precious.<br />
Diner will be enjoyed in a traditional restaurant in Chora.</p>
<p><strong>DAY THREE &#8211; FOOD STYLING &amp; PHOTOGRAPHY SESSION &#8211; 2 </strong></p>
<p>After breakfast at the hotel, Béa will lead a second styling &amp; photography session on the terrace and the beach nearby. This is a unique opportunity to tell a story of foods connected to their surroundings.<br />
For lunch we will drive to a beachside tavern to experience a meal in a typical traditional Greek island tavern, discovering slow-cooked dishes of totally hearty Greek food, prepared by a local cook who is considered an expert in real Greek home-cooked food.<br />
After lunch we will drive to Chora for the thematic workshop “Play with clay”, held in a local ceramic studio.<br />
Then we head out for an afternoon tour of the island. Serifos has a long mining history. Its soil is rich in mineral ore deposits, so the island quickly prospered thanks to its various mines and in the past it was known as “the Iron Island”. Today rusting trucks, railway tracks and parts of pithead machinery lie abandoned on the island’s hillsides and several galleries are actually open to visitors in the southwest side of the island. The place is very interesting for photographic exploration; there is a magical atmosphere in which time seems to be standing still.<br />
Serifos also boasts an impressive 116 churches and sanctuaries that ought to be admired. We will visit one of them, the Taxiarchon Monastery &#8211; a 16th-century monastery &#8211; and then we will drop by the Chrysoloras winery, where the owner and winemaker Christos Chrysoloras makes bio certified wine with a local grape variety called Serfiotiko, which produces a unique white wine.<br />
Dinner will then be enjoyed at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>DAY FOUR &#8211; HANDS-ON TRAINING ON IMAGE POST-PROCESSING &amp; HANDS &#8211; ON GREEK COOKING CLASS</strong></p>
<p>After breakfast at the hotel, a talented chef will teach you how to cook a special dish of Greek cuisine and a local cook will guide the group through the basics of traditional “filo pastry” for a Greek pie (“pita-making”). Most home cooks in Greece do not use the store-bought thin sheets of “filo”, since they make their own: a thick, crunchy “filo” made with olive oil. This “filo” can be used for almost all Greek pies and since it has no butter, it is a crust that can be used in vegan recipes as well.<br />
After the cooking class or after lunch (depending on the preferences of the group) Béatrice Peltre will give you a hands-on training on how to best process your images, have review and critique sessions, in order to help you go home with images that are ready to be printed or put online, sharing her favorite tips, tricks, and shortcuts to get you ready for Lightroom (if you are a beginner).<br />
Lunch will then be enjoyed at the hotel.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we will rest and and spend time swimming at the beach, walking or riding a bike in the area until dinner time, when we lay the table on the beach.<br />
This again will be an opportunity to capture the elusive golden hour when the light is perfect for photographing the dinner table at sunset in front of the sea on Vagià bay.</p>
<p>That afternoon will be an ideal time to soak in the peaceful Greek life by the seaside&#8211; wearing your swimming suits for the day if you wish, since formal attire is not required at dinner.<br />
Dinner will be an occasion again to raise our glasses to scrumptious food and good health as a seal of the new friendships made.</p>
<p><strong>DAY FIVE &#8211; FAREWELL BREAKFAST</strong></p>
<p>After a good, soulful breakfast you will pack your bags and be driven to the port of Serifos where we will say goodbye.</p>
<p>You will board on a ship and sail to the port of Piraeus (2.5-hour trip). The Athens International Airport &#8220;Eleftherios Venizelos&#8221; is approximately 45 km/27.96 miles from the port (50 minutes by taxi).<br />
More information regarding travel arrangements will be sent to you after registration.</p>
<p><em>This is a prospective itinerary. It is subject to modest modifications, dependent on local weather, new opportunities and the preferences of the group.</em></p>

<div class="photolabel"><em>Sicilian countryside</em></div>
<p>I am so excited to announce that I will co-jointly teach a <strong>food styling and photography</strong> <strong>workshop</strong> combined with <strong>Sicilian cooking classes</strong> with my friend Fabrizia Lanza for the <strong>third time</strong>. We have such fonds memories of our times together with previous students that we wanted to do it again. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/D0C8236.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31570" /></p>
<div class="photolabel"><em>Fabizia Lanza at Case Vecchie</em></div>
<p>Our 4 day 5 night workshop will be held at <strong>Case Vecchie</strong>, Fabrizia&#8217;s beautiful cooking school located on the <strong>Tasca D’Almerita Regaleali Winery and Estate</strong> in central <strong>Sicily</strong> (Italy) between <strong>October 24 to October 29, 2017</strong>. </p>

<p>Registration is now open and you can find a lot more information about the contents of the workshop on Anna Tasca&#8217;s website following this <a href="http://www.annatascalanza.com/images/PDF/Corso_B-Peltre_2017_ING.pdf">link</a>. </p>
<p><em>Here are a few things you need to know.</em></p>
<p>The area is located in a scenic and rural part of Sicily, on a large wine estate&#8211;imagine open fields with rolling hills and vines. </p>
<p>You will enjoy amazing local Sicilian cooking made with the traditional scrumptious local produce&#8211;Fabrizia has an amazing vegetable garden&#8211;and by the way, every year, she hosts a 10-week Cook the Farm program which just finished. I hear it was amazing.</p>
<p>Accommodation is in charming rooms that are part of the 19th century Case Vecchie country home and cooking school. Beds have embroidered linen, old framed prints line the walls of the bedrooms, which are full of Sicilian rustic charm. Several rooms have sweeping views of the vineyard and gardens from the shuttered windows. For more details, see pictures <a href="http://www.annatascalanza.com/index.php/en/school/accomodation">here</a>.</p>
<p>You will learn about how to use your camera to become a better food photographer, how to style food with hands on assignments, and how to create pictures that tell a story. At Case Vecchie and Sicily, opportunities for strong pictures abound. We will also make excursions to learn about how to best utilize light and camera settings on location too.</p>
<p>Sicilians are really friendly and I don&#8217;t tire of going back. If you are looking for a serene spot, this is one.</p>
<p><strong>About the practical information:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of the workshop is € 2.700 per person for single-occupancy, and € 4.800 for 2 people in a double occupancy if you&#8217;d like to travel as a couple or with a friend.</p>
<p>These two options include accommodation, all lessons, all meals, and all trips to local producers, with Wi-Fi service, and tea/coffee furniture into your room, and free access to the swimming pool at Case Vecchie (hopefully it will be nice enough to utilize it). </p>

<div class="photolabel"><em>Every day Soup (Soupe de tous les jours)</em></div>
<p>Lulu most likely does not like pineapple because I rarely buy or serve it&#8211;I actually don&#8217;t like pineapple.<br />
On the other hand, my children both enjoy <strong>soup</strong> because I prepare pots filled with all sorts of soup. </p>
<p><strong>Food habits</strong> travel from me to our children, I can see that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great thing because there&#8217;s a ton of nutrition that goes in a bowl of soup. Maybe one day I will revisit the idea of pineapple, and then change the food habit in the family!</p>
<p>But for now we are still looking at <strong>soups</strong> and these days, ours still have a <strong>wintry flair</strong>. </p>
<p>Each one of my children has a preference for one soup versus another too. While Lulu likes the soups I prepare with butternut squash, carrots, sweet potatoes (hello <em>orange</em>!), Rémy eats any kind of soup right now&#8211;and hopefully he will continue. They can be green, orange, white, or red; vegetarian, silky in texture or chunky; with rice or noodles; or loaded with pieces of fish and meat. </p>
<p><em>Toutes les soupes!</em></p>
<p>As long as they continue to eat soups, I am fine with it.</p>
<p>What fascinates me about Lulu is that while it can be hard to say what goes in a soup by just looking at its color (I invent a lot of soups with whatever vegetables I have handy in the fridge, so colors can be a surprise), Lulu is able to pin point at some ingredients I use. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ED0C0904.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31599" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ED0C1674.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31608" /></p>
<p>This weekend, I made a soup with <strong>leek</strong>, <strong>carrots</strong>, <strong>fresh garlic</strong>, and <strong>potatoes</strong> and as I was ready to purée it, I decided to add a handful of <strong>frozen peas</strong> with <strong>baby spinach leaves</strong> in it. The color of the soup turned green with a subtle hint of orange. </p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Tu as mis des petits pois ?</em>&#8221; Lulu inquired after the first spoonful.</p>
<p>I looked at her, surprised, and then smiled. I love that my girl is developing a palate and can guess what goes in a dish.</p>
<p>I like to add <strong>peas</strong> in many dishes, some of  which appear more unusual than others.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/D0C4897.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31596" /></p>
<div class="photolabel"><em>Tartine végétale</em></div>
<p>Going back to our <strong>soup</strong>, it is really easy to make and loaded with good vegetables for my growing children. It&#8217;s also a dish fast to make. In fact, I rushed to prepare it while still wearing my running clothes after a late morning run. Lulu was out with her dad, Rémy, and Philip&#8217;s Irish cousin David who was visiting, and I only had 40 minutes to prepare <strong>lunch</strong> before everyone returned home. I scanned the fridge and created that.</p>
<p>I am glad to report that this soup was a hit on our lunch table (I made it again yesterday so that I could take a quick picture for you, and this time I used <strong>butternut squash</strong> in place of carrots, because that&#8217;s what I had).</p>
<p>I also had <strong>a rind of Parmesan cheese</strong> handy (I keep them refrigerated in a ziplock bag for spontaneous uses like this one), so I added it to the pot of simmering vegetables to give extra body. In many ways, this soup is reminding me of a classic <em>soupe poireau/carotte/pomme de terre</em> (leek/carrot/potato soup) my mother made often when I was a kid. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_6001.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31610" /></p>
<p>Serve the soup with <strong>homemade croûtons</strong> (I flavor mine with olive oil and parsley) and a generous dollop of <strong>crème fraiche</strong>. </p>
<p><em>Bon appétit !</em></p>
<p>And by the way, like in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tartine-Gourmande-Recipes-Inspired-Life/dp/1590307623/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&#038;pd_rd_i=1590307623&#038;pd_rd_r=YWSWMSA0H94WF4B8Z181&#038;pd_rd_w=USze5&#038;pd_rd_wg=7tWFZ&#038;psc=1&#038;refRID=YWSWMSA0H94WF4B8Z181">the first</a>, I have a lot more soup recipes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-French-Family-Table-Recipes/dp/1611801362/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1464622395&#038;sr=1-1&#038;tag=latartinego0f-20">book number 2</a>.</p>

<div class="photolabel"><em>Brown butter pistachio and poppy seeds financiers recipe</em></div>
<p>If there&#8217;s a type of teacake that at home we never tire of&#8211;outside anything involving chunks of <strong>chocolate</strong> as both my children are strong <strong>chocolate lovers</strong>&#8211;it has the name <strong>F.I.N.A.N.C.I.E.R</strong> written all over it. </p>
<p><strong>Financiers</strong> are a favorite. Not only are these French teacakes extremely easy to prepare and bake, but the aroma of butter browning always makes the kitchen smell exquisite, as Lulu proudly likes to notice.</p>
<p>Tonight, I baked a batch of the <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/902952/brown-butter-pistachio-and-poppy-seed-financiers">brown butter pistachio and poppy seed financiers</a> I wrote the recipe for in my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tartine-Gourmande-Recipes-Inspired-Life/dp/1590307623/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&#038;pd_rd_i=1590307623&#038;pd_rd_r=T5FAFZ2WXQ4C5JX63YG2&#038;pd_rd_w=JUyde&#038;pd_rd_wg=vpK8A&#038;psc=1&#038;refRID=T5FAFZ2WXQ4C5JX63YG2">first book</a> (the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-French-Family-Table-Recipes/dp/1611801362/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1464622395&#038;sr=1-1&#038;tag=latartinego0f-20">second book</a> has another recipe using fresh <strong>apricot</strong> and <strong>olive oil</strong> with <strong>pistachio</strong>). </p>
<p>I just remembered that incidentally this first recipe was also one of a few Martha Stewart herself chose for the feature I was lucky to be part of in her <a href="https://www.latartinegourmande.com/2012/05/05/the-martha-stewart-show-beatrice-peltre-tartine-gourmande-hallmark-channel/">show a few years back</a>. I even got a blast watching the video again despite the fact I cannot help but wince when I hear myself speak (click on the first link that includes the recipe to see the video on the Martha Stewart Show page if you feel like it).</p>

<p>I baked these delicious treats because tomorrow is <strong>St Patrick&#8217;s day</strong> and I was strongly encouraged by my sweet half Irish daughter to find in the house, and make, anything we could <strong>green</strong>. And also because I am preparing a yummy dinner for Philip&#8217;s Irish cousins who are visiting from Cork. We intend to spend a good chunk of time cooking and having fun together. We miss them a lot.</p>
<p>Happy St Patrick&#8217;s day for those of you who have a reason to celebrate. I miss Ireland!</p>
<p>Onto the cakes now&#8230;..and a bunch of other <strong>green</strong> foods ahead for us all.  </p>

<div class="photolabel"><em>Rémy at Drumlin farm</em></div>
<p>&#8220;<em>Poules ? Tracteurs ?</em>&#8221; (Chicken? Tractors?) Rémy asked inquisitively as I was struggling to put a puffy winter coat on him. Each time I&#8217;d walk towards him, he&#8217;d tease me and run away, laughing.  &#8220;<em>Poules !</em>&#8221; he exclaimed again in a joyful tone. <em>Oui !</em> I said, taking advantage of a short moment when he was still to finish to dress him. We were ready. And yes indeed, we were going to see chicken and tractors. And much more. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ED0C3130.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31457" /></p>
<p>This happened last Friday when on a sunny morning, I decided to take Rémy to <a href="http://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/drumlin-farm">Drumlin farm</a>. To see <strong>pigs</strong>, <strong>sheep</strong>, <strong>goats</strong>, and <strong>chicken</strong>. And <em>big</em> <strong>tractors</strong>. Rémy *loves <em>tracteurs</em> which I know, would make his great grandfather beam with pride since he worked and raised his family on a farm.</p>
<p>Despite the vivid sun, the air felt brisk, so that it appeared serene and calm at the farm, and we felt like we had it entirely to ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/S7I0509.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31394" /></p>
<p>Maybe it was the fresh air and the peaceful walk Rémy and I took in search of the <em>poules</em> (chicken) and <em>moutons</em> (sheep) and <em>chèvres</em> (goats) but upon our return, I felt energized to cook <strong>lively foods</strong> for us. </p>
<p>I started with a batch of bright <strong>butternut squash and celeriac rosti</strong> for our lunch; I baked deliciously crunchy <strong>quinoa granola</strong> that Rémy gobbled down for <em>le goûter</em> in an imaginary picnic sitting on a blanket by the fire. And when Lulu came back from school, she chose a favorite <strong>financiers</strong> recipe from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-French-Family-Table-Recipes/dp/1611801362/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1464622395&#038;sr=1-1&#038;tag=latartinego0f-20">book</a> for us to cook together&#8211;and we baked them using <strong>blackberries</strong> and <strong>blueberries</strong> instead of the <strong>raspberries</strong> and <strong>red currants</strong> suggested in the recipe. </p>
<p>You should really try these. They are irresistible!</p>
<p>We also made <em>crêpes</em> because after all, Friday was the day of the <a href="http://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-to-celebrate-la-chandeleur-frances-crepe-holiday">Chandeleur</a> and I&#8217;m extremely attached to that <strong>French food celebration</strong>!</p>

<div class="photolabel"><em>Financiers, a recipe (page 214) from my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-French-Family-Table-Recipes/dp/1611801362/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1464622395&#038;sr=1-1&#038;tag=latartinego0f-20">My French Family Table</a></em></div>

<p>Then there was dinner.</p>
<p>Luckily, the idea for ours came easily to me. I had <strong>chicken drumsticks</strong> in the fridge and we all agreed that a family style <strong>meal</strong> (simple to put together) was what we wanted. </p>
<p>So I pulled out my <a href="http://www.latartinegourmandebook.com/">cookbook</a> and found in it the perfect dinner meal&#8211;especially as I always keep most spices and ingredients handy (and when I don&#8217;t, I still improvise and find substitutions). </p>
<p>I thought to share the recipe with you. It&#8217;s a dish with a richly aromatic sauce (with cumin, coriander, ginger, saffron, turmeric, and lots of fresh herbs), scrumptious with rice or quinoa soaked in it. When I am lucky, I even have leftovers for the next day. And that&#8217;s always a bonus in my book.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy it as much as we did.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t usually feel too strongly about new year resolutions but as we crossed the 2017 line, this year felt different for many reasons. </p>
<p>You will surely have noticed that I have not been active on my blog. The thing is that, just like for many of you I am sure, life has been full and finding the right balance for me meant making sacrifices and compromises. My two young children at home took the priority. After all, I know that Rémy is my last baby&#8211;and is already nearly two, even if I am still breastfeeding him&#8211;and it feels that Lulu is also growing too quickly: she&#8217;s just turned eight. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/D0C1018.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31286" /></p>
<p>I will back track to 2016 to give you some context.</p>
<p>Our family of four was really lucky to travel a great deal. Over the summer, we took a long trip across the Atlantic to the island of <strong>Bornholm</strong> in <strong>Denmark</strong> where we&#8217;ve created memories of scrumptious and unique meals at restaurants <a href="http://www.kadeau.dk/bornholm.php">Kadeau</a> and <a href="https://hotelnordlandet.com/en/restaurants/">Sommer Pony</a>. </p>

<p> We visited inspired parts of <strong>Sweden</strong> and got a taste of Stockholm before finishing with a large reunion in <strong>Ireland</strong> to be with our families and friends who traveled from far.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/D0C1253.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31292" /></p>

<p>Earlier in late <strong>January</strong>, we decided at the last minute to spend a week in <strong>Martinique</strong> because spontaneous trips feel oh so fulfilling! Plus we had found really cheap airfares. So why not?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/D0C3051.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31338" /><br />

<p>And we went on to spend a week in <strong>Guadeloupe</strong> in <strong>December</strong> to celebrate Lulu&#8217;s Christmas birthday with friends. We may seriously make traveling to sunny places for Christmas a habit: I mean, between swimming and lounging and resting and still eating chocolate cake and all. What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/S7I0107.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31346" /></p>

<p>Classic me, I cooked my way through every trip, traveling with cooking utensils and ingredients. It&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/D0C1810.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31299" /></p>

<p>We also enjoyed family times near us, taking in the beauty of the countryside in <strong>Vermont</strong> and the beautiful beaches of <strong>Cape Cod </strong>, especially as we&#8217;ve made a ritual to visit in October, when the summer crowds are away.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/D0C6324.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31311" /></p>

<p>Between many birthdays in <strong>May</strong>, I reached a professional milestone with the publication of my <strong>second cookbook</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-French-Family-Table-Recipes/dp/1611801362/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1464622395&#038;sr=1-1&#038;tag=latartinego0f-20">My French Family Table</a>. Back then, I wanted to tell you so much about this book that I wrote, styled, and photographed for nearly two years. But then, I found that my time was constantly squeezed. And rather than trying to always look at what I was unable to do on the blog or book front&#8211;and feel terrible about it&#8211;I preferred instead to focus on what I could <strong>and</strong> was able to do well next to indispensable work commitments. Which is take care of <strong>Lulu</strong> and <strong>Rémy</strong> and our family of four. Together.</p>
<p>And I am so glad I did. After all, having Rémy at nearly forty six of age feels like I&#8217;ve been gifted with a <strong>miracle</strong> baby. I often like to secretly whisper these meaningful words in his ear. I think he likes to hear them. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.latartinegourmande.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/covershotFFT.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31001" /></p>
<p>Yet, I&#8217;d like you to know that even more than with book number #1, I feel really strong with <strong>book #2</strong> as it speaks a lot about me and our life right now.</p>
<p>I am extremely <strong>proud</strong> of it.</p>
<p>It gathers many of my beliefs about how to raise and teach <strong>my children</strong> to grow a <strong>positive</strong> and <strong>happy</strong> relationship with <strong>food</strong> and <strong>family meals</strong>. As suggested by its title and my roots, the book is truly French in inspiration but with a more relaxed feel, as I wanted it fitted to family life, to my life within our family, with <strong>wholesome recipes</strong> (all 120 are <strong>gluten free</strong> by the way) made with bright and colorful ingredients, vegetables, and fresh produce&#8211;those that I am always fan to gather and use in my kitchen. </p>

<p>So many recipes are <strong>every day family favorites</strong>. It&#8217;s unusual for me but I use this book as if it were not mine, turning to it many times every single week to cook our meals. It&#8217;s a pretty freeing feeling. </p>
<p>Lulu has a weakness for the <strong>sweet potato tartlets</strong> and <strong>chocolate mousse with salted caramel and matcha tea langues de chat</strong>.</p>

<p>I am very fond of my <strong>saffron-flavored carrot risotto</strong>, the <strong>fish papillotes</strong> and <strong>watermelon radish salad</strong>. Not to forget to mention the <strong>Sunday roasted chicken</strong> which I&#8217;ve just cooked once again tonight for dinner.</p>

<p>Not forgetting cake!</p>
<p>Such as the <strong>hazelnut chocolate cake</strong> that I make over and over, at home or everywhere I travel to&#8211;Lulu nicknamed it the <strong>chocolate cake</strong> <em>de tous les jours</em> (every day) because I literally bake it every week, making a new one when the last crumbs from the previous are gone. Rémy likes to walk around the house repeating the words &#8220;<em>chocolate cake</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>colala</em>&#8221; (his cute way to refer to chocolate in French at the moment) with the hope that I am going to feed him some as much as possible <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And he tries each time really hard!</p>

<p>Now I will admit that these days, I find challenging to be speaking lightly about <strong>chocolate</strong> and <strong>cakes</strong> or anything else we enjoy eating in view of the so many upsetting news events that are easy to keep me away from even wanting to cook. But the reality is such that I feel I need to continue to put my love and passion into making beautiful healthy foods for my family and friends.</p>
<p>And cake and chocolate do help.</p>
<p>So I thought you&#8217;d like to have this <strong>marbled cake</strong> recipe to turn to too, whenever you need it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cake that my children love.</p>
<p>And we do too.</p>
<p><em>Well,</em> enjoy the cake. I am glad to be back.</p>
