<h4>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h4>



<p>I&#8217;ve been working with a few people who are very intelligent, very competent, and very talented —&nbsp;but they get stuck in indecision and analysis paralysis.</p>



<p>In effect, overthinking and getting lost in endless options reduces their effectiveness and intelligence by producing inaction.</p>



<p><em>Taking any action is likely to be better than inaction and indecision</em>, but we can get so caught up in trying to find the perfect decision that we make no decision.</p>



<p><strong>The answer is to cut through the indecision and overthinking with action</strong>.</p>



<p>Before we talk about that, let&#8217;s look at what&#8217;s going on with smart, competent people who get stuck in their beautiful minds.</p>



<h3>The Trap of Overthinking</h3>



<p>For someone who doesn&#8217;t see a lot of possibilities, sometimes a choice is easy — you just choose the one that looks obvious.</p>



<p>But for someone who has an abundance of intelligence, there are many more doors than that. And choosing can seem impossible. So this person starts creating a decision tree in their mind: &#8220;If I choose this, then this might happen, which means I need to decide if I want this, and then that might happen &#8230; but then this other option brings three more decisions &#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>They also will research every option, which leads to more research. It becomes an endless cycle of thinking through options, researching it, and through the research finding even more things to think about. No decision can ever be made!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also impossible to analyze so many endless options, because each option contains a lot of uncertainty —&nbsp;you can never know how each will turn out, how important every factor is, what the probability is of each possibility happening.</p>



<p><strong>The uncertainty in this kind of thinking is what keeps us stuck in indecision.</strong> We fear the uncertain outcome, and would rather have cold hard data, and much more certainty.</p>



<p>But we can never have the kind of certainty we&#8217;d like. We&#8217;d have to run experiments or do scientific research on every single thing before taking action, which means we&#8217;ve just missed out on opportunities as we did that research! Spending a lot of time analyzing comes with opportunity cost.</p>



<p>So how do we deal with this? By cutting through the overthinking with action.</p>



<h3>Cutting Through with Action</h3>



<p>If overthinking can be a trap of indecision, an unsolvable knot &#8230; how do we untie it? By cutting through it.</p>



<p>There can be no solving this knot through thinking — it&#8217;s thinking that gets us into it. Now, I&#8217;m not saying that &#8220;thinking is bad&#8221; &#8230; I believe we should contemplate pros and cons, that we should take a step back from action and get some perspective, see the big picture, consider the deeper Why of what we&#8217;re doing. But at some point, we have to say, &#8220;Enough!&#8221; And then take action.</p>



<p>Setting a limit for thinking can be a good way to do this. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to spend the next 2 days thinking about it, and then make a decision on Tuesday.&#8221; You consider the merits, you do a bit of research, you talk to other people. Then you decide, and take action.</p>



<p>How do you decide when there is no certain answer? You have to just pick something that seems to be the best, given your limited information. It&#8217;s like poker — you never have complete information, but have to make a decision based on what you do know, and the most likely outcomes (the likelihood is based on what you know, but you can adjust your mental probabilities with experience).</p>



<p>You start by taking a step back, think about your deeper Why as it relates to this decision &#8230; and also what you&#8217;re basing this decision on. Is it based on fear? On instant gratification of a desire? These don&#8217;t lead to good long-term outcomes, in my experience. The place to come from is long-term benefit — is this a loving action for those you care about, or for yourself?</p>



<p>Then you think about the different factors that weigh into the decision, and how important each are to you. You think about likely outcomes of each possibility (don&#8217;t limit yourself to just 2 possibilities), and weigh the probable benefits with the probable costs.</p>



<p>And then finally, you just go with the decision that seems best. Do a quick review of whether this is for the best long-term benefit. And then pull the trigger. Step off the plank.</p>



<p>You cut through all the doubts and fears and hand-wringing that are holding you back, and just dive in.</p>



<p>Get good at this diving in by doing it in small versions:</p>



<ul><li>Write something short and publish it</li><li>Take a small action to your long-term dream career or business</li><li>Take a small action to be healthier</li><li>Declutter one thing that&#8217;s easy to decide on, rather than getting stuck on things that are hard for you to make a decision about</li></ul>



<p>What decisions are you stuck on? Can you make a small decision that&#8217;s easier, and take action? It might give you more information that helps with the bigger decision. And in the end, the real benefit is practicing taking action without getting caught up in indecision and inaction.</p>

		<title>The Most Neglected &amp; Powerful Act of Self-Care</title>

<h4>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h4>



<p>Many of us are (rightfully) focused on taking care of our health, eating nourishing whole foods and trying to be active &#8230; while meditating and flossing and taking some time of disconnection, away from devices.</p>



<p>These are wonderful acts of self-care, and they are necessary and important.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s one act of self-care that is very often neglected, and it might be even more important than all the others: <strong>the practice of loving yourself</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, this is so often neglected that when I mention &#8220;loving yourself,&#8221; many people don&#8217;t know what that means. Many of us have never consciously done it. If we have, it&#8217;s so rare as to be a forgotten memory.</p>



<p><strong>But it&#8217;s my belief that we should do it throughout the day, like trying to drink 8 glasses of water. We should give ourselves at least 8 doses of loving ourselves every day.</strong></p>



<p>What is this &#8220;self-love&#8221; (not in the sexual sense)? Imagine pouring out love in your heart to someone you love dearly — what would that feel like? Now try doing the same thing for yourself. That&#8217;s self-love, and it&#8217;s a completely foreign concept for the vast majority of people.</p>



<h3>Why It&#8217;s So Important</h3>



<p>I coach a number of people, 1-on-1 and in small and large groups — and pretty much everyone I meet is hard on themselves in some way. In some kind of stress and pain. Disappointed in themselves, angry at themselves, constantly feeling inadequate.</p>



<p>Do you relate to this? I think most of us can find a good chunk of this in ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>This is the basic problem that most of us face, every single day</strong>. We don&#8217;t love big portions of ourselves. We beat ourselves up, all day long. We stress out about uncertainty because we don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re good enough to deal with it. We don&#8217;t trust ourselves to stick to something, because we&#8217;ve formed a really bad picture of ourselves over the years. We get angry at ourselves for eating too much, drinking too much alcohol, messing up in a social situation, getting distracted and watching videos or playing video games, and so on and so on. We are harsh on ourselves, and don&#8217;t like how we look or who we are, in many ways.</p>



<p>This affects everything in our lives. It makes us more stressed, less happy, anxious, depressed, stuck, procrastinating, less happy in relationships, less focused, more likely to reach for comfort foods or distraction or shopping to comfort ourselves from the stress and pain of being who we are.</p>



<p>But if we could give ourselves love, it would start to heal all of this. Everything could shift. We could deal with uncertainty and chaos and difficulty in a much more resilient way.</p>



<p>Giving ourselves love is such an important act of self-care, and yet is rarely ever done.</p>



<h3>How to Give Ourselves Love Regularly</h3>



<p>Set reminders for yourself, everywhere you go. Put reminders on your fridge, on your computer, on your phone, on your bathroom mirror, in your car, at your desk, near your TV.</p>



<p>The reminders only need to be two words: &#8220;Love yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>When you see the reminder, the act is very simple (even if it doesn&#8217;t feel natural to most people yet — give it time):</p>



<ol><li><strong>Pause and feel any stress, pain, self-doubt, anger, frustration, anxiety you might be feeling</strong>. Let yourself actually feel it, physically in your body, for just a few moments. It&#8217;s OK to feel this.</li><li><strong>Now give yourself the balm of love</strong>. As weird or silly as it feels, just try it. Imagine first that you are sending love to someone you love very much — your child, your parent, your best friend. Imagine them going through difficulty, and send love from your hear to theirs, hoping to make them better. Notice how that feels in your heart. Now try it for yourself, generating the same feeling in your heart, but sending it to yourself instead.</li><li><strong>Feel the love as a healing balm</strong>. No matter how little you&#8217;re able to generate, feel it wash over your stress, pain, anger, doubt &#8230; like a thick, syrupy liquid soothing the pain. Let yourself receive this love like the love you&#8217;ve been craving.</li></ol>



<p>It&#8217;s that simple. It only takes a few moments — feel your stress and pain, send yourself love, let yourself feel it.</p>



<p>Do it 8 times a day. Or a dozen, if you can.</p>



<p>You need this care. Don&#8217;t hold it back from yourself any longer.</p>

<h4>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h4>



<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce that I&#8217;m launching a completely new version of my <a href="https://fearless.zenhabits.net">Fearless Training Program</a> (which I think of as &#8220;Fearless 2.0&#8221;).</p>



<p>A little over a year ago, I launched the Fearless Training Program on Patreon, as an experiment: how do I train people in the uncertainty of doing meaningful work? What would an effective training system look like?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve spent the past year figuring that out, with some amazing people taking part in the program, and I&#8217;ve learned a lot.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve learned that:</p>



<ul><li>If you train wholeheartedly in this, you can see some amazing results, completely changing your relationship to fear and discomfort</li><li>You can gain confidence, the ability to be with your most difficult emotions, the ability to overcome your deepset patterns</li><li>People training in this have overcome fears to create amazing things and step into a bigger game</li><li>Training with others, in teams, is a powerful way to shift things</li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;ve also learned that Patreon wasn&#8217;t a good platform for this kind of program. People had a hard time finding things, it&#8217;s hard to build a community there, and it was confusing to newcomers to the program, to name just a few things.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m relaunching, with a simplified structure, a beautiful new website, and <a href="https://fearless.zenhabits.net">an even more powerful program</a>.</p>



<h3>Deepen Training Beyond Basic Habits</h3>



<p>For seven years now, I&#8217;ve run my <a href="https://seachange.zenhabits.net/">Sea Change Program</a> as a way to help people change their habits. And it has been fantastic — more than a thousand people joined and trained every month to change habits. I&#8217;ve seen some incredible transformations in Sea Change.</p>



<p>Sea Change is a powerful place to lay the foundation of your new life: you learn to change your habits, create mindfulness, get healthy, wake earlier, work on relationships and clutter and finances. This helps you get stability and feel like you have a handle on your life.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fearless.zenhabits.net">Fearless Training Program</a> is the next step, to deepen your training.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten that foundation, you are ready to push into the habitual patterns that arise when you do meaningful work. You are ready to face head-on the procrastination, the avoidance, the distraction, the self-doubts that will come on when you intentionally put yourself into uncertainty.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re ready to learn to be dedicated to your deepest work, and to be devoted to people you care deeply about.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re ready to train with others in small teams, to get accountability and support to hold you in the training when you feel like running.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s transformative.</p>



<h3>The Way Fearless Training Works</h3>



<p>The new Fearless 2.0 is designed to be more effective. It is structured like this:</p>



<ol><li>We have <strong>Monthly Focuses for our training</strong>, with a guided meditation training that you are encouraged to do daily, training videos and articles, homework, and a live community training call.</li><li>You set <strong>a monthly goal</strong> for your training — write four chapters of your book, for example. You do <strong>weekly check-ins</strong> with your team and the larger Fearless community for learning and accountability.</li><li>You have <strong>training sessions</strong> (4 a week) to work on your goal and train mindfully in uncertainty.</li><li>We have <strong>a Fearless community and small teams</strong>, to give you accountability, support and compassion as you train. You are not alone — you&#8217;re on this journey with others who struggle as well, who are making incremental progress in shifting their patterns.</li><li>You&#8217;ll get <strong>guidance from me</strong> — I lead the monthly community training calls, develop the Monthly Focus content (including meditations, videos, articles, etc.), have a monthly Q&amp;A to answer your questions, and do 1-on-1 training calls with people when needed.</li></ol>



<p>It takes commitment, but if you have meaningful work in your life, if you care deeply about who you serve, if you have something you want to create in the world &#8230; this is the training you need.</p>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s the best program in the world for training in the uncertainty and shifting the habitual patterns that arise with meaningful work.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://fearless.zenhabits.net"><strong>Join me in the new Fearless Training Program — there&#8217;s a 7-day trial to check it out, and a 100% moneyback guarantee.</strong></a></p>

<h4>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h4>



<p>Every day in this world is a shaky, uncertain, constantly changing landscape — and that causes us to try to get control.</p>



<p>We create lists, systems, routines, schedules, comfort foods, comfortable environments … we build our whole lives and identities around these comforts and control. We try to control the uncontrollable evershifting landscape of our lives.</p>



<p>And it doesn’t work. You can’t get a firm grasp on the fluidity of life. And so we get stressed, procrastinate, feel hurt, get depressed or anxious, get angry or frustrated, lash out or complain.</p>



<p>Into this craziness I’d like to suggest the <strong>ridiculously awesome practice of surrendering</strong>.</p>



<p>What does this mean? It’s the idea of letting go of some of our systems and instincts to get control, trying to make the world exactly as we like it, trying to avoid all the things we dislike … and instead, relaxing, accepting, even surrendering to the uncertainty and fluidity of this world.</p>



<p>Surrendering means we relax into the shifting landscape. We let go of trying to control everything, and smile with friendliness at the world as it is, beautiful and amazing.</p>



<h3><strong>Surrender vs. Control Strategies</strong></h3>



<p>Surrender sounds lame to many people, or perhaps scary. It’s the opposite of what we are constantly trying to do — we are always seeking control, because we don’t like uncertainty. At all.</p>



<p>We want to control our day, so we have routines, schedules, systems. We create systems for our work, try to get control over our health through new diets or exercise programs, try to control our relationships, our future, our finances.</p>



<p>And there’s nothing wrong with any of this … except that it’s a bit futile to try to control the uncontrollable. It’s like trying to build a building out of water — you keep trying and keep trying, but it’s just not a solid building material.</p>



<p>So control is a strategy that isn’t actually effective, even if it’s completely understandable. What effects does it have?</p>



<p>Constantly trying to get control results in:</p>



<ul><li>Stress and anxiety about not having control</li><li>Being driven by fears</li><li>Not being happy with how things are (because they’re not in control)</li><li>Getting some degree of control over things, but still not feeling in control — so you keep seeking it, resulting in constant striving, anxiety</li><li>Lashing out at others when they interfere with your controlled world</li><li>Spending time, money, energy, and other valuable resources constantly trying to get control</li><li>Feeling lost, depressed, unhappy with yourself and the world when you can’t get control (which is inevitable)</li></ul>



<p>Now, I’m not saying we should never try to get control. There are helpful ways of getting control, but often it’s more helpful to shift the focus from control to love — taking care of yourself can be a loving act rather than an attempt to gain control over your health, for example.</p>



<p>What would it be like, instead of trying to get control, to surrender instead? It might look like being fully present in this moment, experiencing the sensations of the moment, being curious about it. It might look like acceptance of how things are. In fact, there are lots of ways surrender might look … let’s talk about how amazing they might be.</p>



<h3><strong>Why Surrender is Ridiculously Awesome</strong></h3>



<p>So we pause our striving to control … and we relax. We stop trying to change things and just become present.</p>



<p>We tune in to how we’re feeling. We notice the sensations of the moment, both in our bodies and all around us. We become present to whoever is in front of us. When we do a task, we pour ourselves fully into it.</p>



<p>We open to the uncertainty of the moment. We see what we can learn from it, with an open mind, with curiosity and a stance of not-knowing instead of a fixed viewpoint.</p>



<p>We start to appreciate the moment in front of us, fully. There is something immensely awesome about the moment in front of us, if we stop trying to change it, trying to control it, trying to have it conform to our idea of how things should be. Just as it is, it’s worthy of our appreciation, gratitude, love.</p>



<p>We can fall in love with the moment, just as it is, if we open to it.</p>



<p>Surrender is all of this and more. It’s openness, full presence, awareness of what’s happening, curiosity and immense appreciation. And it takes so much less energy than control.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Practice Surrender</strong></h3>



<p>I am not advocating a complete giving up of control of all areas of your life. Obviously this could lead to financial ruin, the ruination of relationships and your work and health and more.</p>



<p>But before we grasp for control, we can try surrender as a way to practice with whatever is coming up … and perhaps to accept things as they are a bit more, and need to control less.</p>



<p>For example … I might be feeling like my health is out of control, and feeling some anxiety about it … and so I want to go on a diet and set up an exercise plan and get everything under control. Now, these are not bad intentions, but we know that this kind of fear-based approach often doesn’t work. You never stop feeling out of control.</p>



<p>So instead, I practice surrendering, and feel the fears coming up for me. I relax a bit and see that I’m suffering, that I could use some self-love. I also notice that instead of being unhappy with my health, I could love my body, love this moment as it is, even if it contains some pain and discomfort. Relaxing, surrendering, loving things as they are … I can set an intention to love myself with nourishing food and movement.</p>



<p>The surrendering doesn’t mean that I don’t take action — it means that I accept things as they are, and yet bring a loving intention into the equation. How can I love things as they are and have my actions come from a place of love as well?</p>



<p>Coming from a place of love instead of fear is powerfully transformative.</p>



<p>And even if I never take that loving action in the future … the present is transformed as well. This moment is completely different for me if I’m not grasping for the illusion of control, but instead loving what is.</p>



<p>So here are some ways to practice surrender:</p>



<ul><li>Notice that you’re looking to control things, and instead pause. Drop into your body and notice the fear, uncertainty, anxiety that is causing you to want to get control. Stay with this physical sensation in your body, the energy of uncertainty, that causes you to grasp for control. Be with it fully, allowing yourself to feel it. Relax and surrender to it.</li><li>Open yourself to the rest of the moment, noticing how freaking amazing this moment is if you open up and pay attention. See it with fresh eyes, as if you’ve never experienced this moment before. Bring wonder and curiosity into this new viewing of the world.</li><li>Let yourself rest in openness — you don’t need to control things, you don’t need to know exactly what will happen, but instead, you an find an ease in the openness of this moment, the unknown quality of a beautifully shifting landscape.</li><li>How can you love yourself and everything around you in the middle of this openness? Can you fall in love with this moment?</li><li>What loving intention can you set for yourself in this situation? Coming from a place of love instead of fear, what would be the best next small step to take?</li></ul>



<p>What a world we live in, if only we can fully see it. Surrendering is the way to move into that.</p>

<p>I have a friend who is working on a meaningful project that he wants to focus on … and so he said no to some exciting opportunities.</p>



<p>These were projects where people he highly respects want him to work with them. How can you say no to that?!</p>



<p>Understandably, he felt difficulty after saying no to these amazing opportunities — the pain and fear of missing out. I think a lot of us can relate to that.</p>



<p>The fear and pain of missing out (actually, any fear or pain) can be an amazing opportunity to practice, to open our hearts, to deal with our deep feelings of inadequacy.</p>



<p>It’s a transformative practice.</p>



<h3><strong>Saying No is Saying Yes to Focus &amp; Space</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s say you’re missing out on important opportunities by saying no. You don’t normally say no — you say yes to too much, and are constantly overloaded. You are constantly too busy, stressed about getting everything done, overworked and prone to burnout, missing deadlines and not doing as well as you could on projects because you’ve got too much going on.</p>



<p>So saying no to these opportunities is a big shift. It means:</p>



<ul><li>You are going to give priority to what’s on your plate. Finally!</li><li>You are going to create space for sanity, for self-care, for not burning out.</li><li>You are going to give full focus to the work that’s most meaningful to you, that you are most committed to doing.</li></ul>



<p>These are amazing things. These are loving actions to yourself and the people you care about.</p>



<p>And yet, the fear and pain of missing incredible opportunities arises.</p>



<h3><strong>Practicing with the Fear &amp; Pain</strong></h3>



<p>So you notice yourself struggling with this fear and pain. It’s an incredible doorway to practice and transformation.</p>



<p>Here’s how you might practice:</p>



<ul><li>Stop and notice that you are feeling either fear or pain (or both) of missing something important. Pain of not being able to do what you’d like to do. Fear of missing what you should be doing.</li><li>Pause and let yourself feel the pain and fear. We don’t let ourselves feel it, and run from it, avoid it, fear feeling. But we have the capacity to feel more than we let ourselves fear. We have the courage. Pause and actually feel it — not the thoughts about what you’re missing, but the physical feeling of fear and pain.</li><li>Ask yourself if there is anything on your plate right now that is less important than what you’ve said no to. Is there anything on your plate you’d remove to make room for this opportunity? If not, you are clear on your priorities (even if there’s never going to be any real certainty that it’s the right choice).</li><li>Remind yourself that you’ve said yes to your priorities and to having focus and space. That this fear and pain come with this amazingly loving act of saying yes to focus, space and priorities. It’s a part of the experience, and you will feel it many more times. And that’s OK!</li><li>Remind yourself that you would have felt even greater pain if you had said yes. The pain of being overloaded, too busy, overcommitted, never having time. The pain of burnout, of missing deadlines, of doing worse than you can on each project. The pain you’re feeling now isn’t as bad.</li><li>Feel the love in saying yes to your biggest priorities. Feel the love in saying yes to focus and space. Appreciate how amazing that is.</li><li>Fearing missing out is also a kind of “greed” (in a nonjudgmental sense) — we always want more, and want to pile our plates high with everything. Instead, can we be grateful for what we’ve put on our plates? Can we see how amazing the things we’ve chosen are? Can we see that they are enough, and we don’t need more?</li><li>At the heart of the fear of missing out is our deep feeling of inadequacy. We fear that if we miss out on something important, somehow we won’t be OK. Let yourself face the pain of your feelings of inadequacy, and make friends with this. Can you be friendly and kind to these feelings of inadequacy?</li><li>Feel the goodness in yourself for the acts you’ve taken. You are a beautiful, courageous person with a good heart. You can handle things if they don’t turn out as well as you like. You have made it through much worse.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Learn to trust yourself by seeing the goodness in yourself. Learn to validate yourself. Learn to make friends with yourself. Learn to have the courage to feel everything, and be OK with what you feel.</p>



<p>In the end, you will always miss out on something important. It’s unavoidable. But what you are gaining is worth being grateful for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h3>



<p>We’ve all done it: we have an important task to do, and yet we have to do a thousand other things before we can start:</p>



<ul><li>Process email and reply to messages</li><li>Make sure we’re up-to-date with the latest news</li><li>Pay bills and check on our bank accounts</li><li>Make sure the kitchen is clean</li><li>Check social media one more time</li><li>Look up that obscure fact we’re suddenly curious about</li></ul>



<p>We’re looking for perfect conditions before we can start to find any focus, before we can launch into that important, meaningful task that we’re committed to doing.</p>



<p>When we’re done with all of that, we decide it’s time to get going with that important task … but first, there’s that one other thing we realized we need to do. <em>Every little task takes importance over this important task</em>.</p>



<p>Try this experiment: commit yourself to doing the one big important task you know you’ve been wanting to do (it’s usually one you can identify easily, because you’ve been putting it off) … and commit to doing it right after you’re done reading this post.</p>



<p>See if you find little things you need to do first, before you can get started. If you have no problem, commit yourself to doing the next most important task (or continuing this one, if it needs several sessions) first thing tomorrow morning. I mean first thing, before you start checking messages or getting ready or taking care of the little things you normally do in the morning.</p>



<p>And then try it every day this week. If you’re like most people, you’ll find a bunch of things you need to do to clear the decks before you can get started.</p>



<p>But here’s what I’ve been reminding myself: <strong>you don’t need to clear the decks to get started</strong>. You can just launch into the important task.</p>



<p>The feeling that you need to take care of everything else first comes from a handful of sources:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Feeling overwhelmed by everything</strong>. You have a thousand tasks on your plate, and you want to clear as many of them out because you’re feeling overwhelmed. I get this, I feel the same way. But putting off the important things to get a feeling of control over your huge pile of tasks is rarely the answer (sometimes it is, if the pile is causing problems). This just leads to the important tasks never getting done, because we get into the habit of prioritizing the pile. Instead, it’s usually better to deal with the feeling of overwhelm by <em>feeling</em> it. Meditating on the feeling, accepting it, letting it be there as we dive into the important task.</li><li><strong>Feeling overwhelmed by the important task</strong>. We put off the task because it’s big, scary, difficult, overwhelming. Something about the important task makes us shut down — it’s like our brains have a fuse box that gets overloaded and shuts down to keep us safe. This is completely understandable! Something in our past made us feel that we can’t handle these kinds of overwhelming feelings. But it’s usually not true — we can handle the overwhelming feeling. We can turn towards it, feel it, be with it. Practicing like this, we teach ourselves that feeling stressed by this is no problem, that we can handle it.</li><li><strong>Knowing that you actually need to do the other tasks</strong>. There is some truth to needing to take care of all the other tasks. They actually need to get done. So it’s not a bad idea to take a look at your list and ask what you <em>actually</em> need to get done right now. Do you need to take care of a few smaller administrative tasks before you launch into the important tasks? Or can they wait an hour? Usually they can wait, if we’re honest with ourselves. Sometimes (probably less than 10% of the time), we need to take care of a couple of smaller tasks now.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Old habits die hard</strong>. In truth, much of the time it’s a combination of all of the above, and then just the way we’ve always done things. For example, maybe you’ve always started your day with a cup of coffee and reading your favorite news sites and social media. Then you do email and admin tasks. Only after doing all of that do you start the important work. Starting with the important work before all of that would feel wrong! But there is nothing written in stone here — we can start earlier, and in fact, if we get into this new habit, we’ll find that we’re getting the important work done more often, and having the impact on the world we’d like to have.</li></ol>



<p>Here’s what I’ve been practicing around this:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Notice when I’m feeling like taking care of everything else</strong>. Bringing awareness to the problem, I can turn toward the feelings of overwhelm instead of trying to fix the feelings by doing little tasks or running away from the important task. Be fully with the feeling of overwhelm, stress, fear. Let myself open up to the feeling, and see that it’s actually OK that the feelings are there with me. I can still do the task with them there.</li><li><strong>Turn toward the task with an open heart</strong>. Now that I’ve allowed myself to feel the overwhelm, I can turn toward the task and see that actually, I have committed to doing this out of love for myself and others. This task is actually an act of love. It is important enough to overcome my discomfort and open myself up to it.</li><li><strong>Do the smallest step</strong>. If it’s hard, scary and overwhelming, can I focus on just a small piece of it that’s actually doable? Do I need to worry about the whole mountain, or just the next step that I can actually do? I pick a small step (maybe writing just one sentence), and let that be the thing I focus on.</li><li><strong>Be fully there with that small step, as if it’s the whole world</strong>. With that small step in front of me, I let everything else fade away. I’ve already done my thinking and decided that this is what I need to focus on. So I don’t need to think about it anymore — I can just pour myself completely into it. It’s the whole universe. Nothing else matters right now (unless a loved one asks for my attention, then they are all that matters), so I let everything go and devote myself to this completely, as if it deserves my full attention, my full heart, my absolute commitment and devotion.</li></ul>



<p>In addition, I’ll keep a note where I can write down the small things that I think of doing, and know that I can get to those later in the day. There’s a place for those things, but it’s not right now.</p>



<p>What is worthy of your full heart, attention and devotion right now?</p>

<p>While relationships can be such a rewarding place of intimacy, delight and love, it&#8217;s also true that they can trigger us to shut down our hearts. This is a constant struggle for many people, and also the place of potential for our biggest personal growth.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delightful, it&#8217;s delicious, it&#8217;s de-lovely.&#8221;</p><cite>-Cole Porter</cite></blockquote>



<h4>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h4>



<p>We’ve all felt the frustration of having someone in our lives who seems constantly negative — complaining, getting offended by small things, angry, pessimistic.</p>



<p>This can be very difficult, draining us of energy and turning our minds to negativity as well.</p>



<p>One solution that many recommend is to cut these people out of your life. And yes, if they are harming you, or you just cannot get to a healthy mental place with them in your life, then cutting them out of your life can be a step toward healing yourself.</p>



<p>But there’s another way to consider as well, especially if you’re in a place where you can focus on growing yourself beyond your old patterns that might not be serving you.</p>



<p>And that’s <strong>learning to find the deliciousness in this negative person</strong>.</p>



<p>Let me explain. Here’s this person who is complaining, negative, critical, and they are in your life. Perhaps they’re a loved one, and you care about them. In truth, <em>this person is hurting</em>. And you know what it’s like to hurt like this … <strong>because you are hurting right now in very much the same way</strong>.</p>



<p>When this person is critical of you, you feel the stress and pain of that criticism. You might not realize it, but you do — otherwise, you wouldn’t be frustrated or irritated with them for being a negative person. You’re reacting to them in the same way they’re reacting to you — with negativity. You’re both feeling similar pain, and both reacting out of old patterns of criticism, complaining, anger, frustration.</p>



<p>So you see how their negativity affects you, and you know you don’t want to do the same to others. You see that this negativity festers in them, and makes them unhappy. You see how painful that must be, and you don’t want that for yourself.</p>



<p><strong>And so the change must start with you, right now</strong>. If you don’t want to be negative like that, then start right now — can you be loving and positive towards this person who is negative in your life?</p>



<h3>A Practice for Negative People</h3>



<p>Here’s how you might work with the energy of a negative person:</p>



<ol><li><strong>See this person’s’ pain, with compassion</strong>. If the person is being negative, it’s because they’re feeling stress, pain, unhappiness, insecurity, uncertainty. You certainly know what it’s like to feel these things — in fact, you might be feeling some of them right now. See the negativity as an old habit that is masking their pain. See if you can feel compassion for that pain, which you have also experienced.</li><li><strong>See that they have an old pattern that is unhelpful</strong>. Their pattern, when they feel this pain, is to lash out, complain, criticize, stew in negativity. At some point, that might have helped them get through difficult times. But it’s not serving them anymore. You can see, with compassion, that they are stuck in this old pattern. And recognize that you, just like everyone else, also have old unhelpful patterns that are tough to get rid of. In this way, the two of you are connected.</li><li><strong>Feel love for them</strong>. If this person is a loved one, it’s especially helpful to practice pouring your love out to them, even if you say nothing. Just feeling it in your heart is enough. They might feel the love, but they might not — even then, it transforms /you/. You then shift how you are towards them, coming from a place of love. If this person isn’t a loved one but a colleague or even a person you don’t know well … can you open your heart to feeling love for others who aren’t close to you? This might be a heart-opening shift for most people, well worth the discomfort of stretching into something new.</li><li><strong>See the beauty in them, and love that as well</strong>. They have negativity, pain, old patterns … but they also have a beautiful heart, and lots of amazing qualities that can get obscured by the negativity. See this beauty, behold their hurting heart, and have your breath taken away by this human being in front of you.</li><li><strong>See the deliciousness in their negative energy</strong>. When someone is being negative, there is an energy that is pouring out of them and into you. It can be an energy that we don’t like … but it doesn’t have to be. We can open up to this energy, and savor its taste, learning to appreciate its little nuances. We can find the deliciousness in it, dropping our old characterization of this energy, and seeing it afresh. It’s just an experience, just like it’s an experience to feel the sensations of basking in the sun, feeling a breeze on your skin, submerging into a warm bath. Relish this experience, and you’ll be open to a much wider range of experience than ever before.</li></ol>



<p>It’s a transformative practice that will shift your relationship to others. And when someone gives you a negative energy, you can delight in the opportunity this gives you to practice.</p>



<h3>Very Important Caveats</h3>



<p>With all that said, there are some important counterpoints to remember:</p>



<ul><li><strong>It’s absolutely OK to set boundaries</strong>. If you need to protect yourself from getting hurt, or you need some time away from this person (or need some time alone), speak up for your boundaries. It’s OK to not let yourself be abused or hurt. Protect yourself. It’s only from this place of being protected and having boundaries that we can do this work.</li><li><strong>You can also gift them with honesty</strong>. If the other person is being overly negative, critical, playing the victim … it’s one thing to practice seeing the beauty in all of that, but once you do, you can come from a place of love when you share with them the impact of their negativity on you, on others, on them. It’s a good practice to share this kind of honesty, so that you’re not holding back from others, and they can benefit from seeing how they’re impacting others. It doesn’t have be done in a negative, critical, angry way, but can be from a place of compassion and non-judgment.</li><li><strong>You can do the same kind of work for yourself</strong>: When you see your own pain, your own negativity, feel love for yourself, and se the deliciousness in your own energy.</li><li><strong>It’s OK to not practice this “perfectly.”</strong> You might not always find their negative energy delicious. You might not always find compassion for them. That’s OK – see if you can find glimpses of compassion, flashes of love, nibbles of deliciousness. Practice in whatever capacity you can, and see what happens!</li></ul>



<p>Are you open to this kind of practice? What would it be like for you to open to the deliciousness of every kind of energy?</p>

<h4>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h4>



<p>All my life, I&#8217;ve struggled with being half-committed.</p>



<p>Not always, but more than I&#8217;d usually like to admit. I say I&#8217;m going to stick to something, and I actually believe it &#8230; but then a week later (sometimes sooner, sometimes longer), I falter. I justify it. I feel guilty. I try not to think about it. I resolve to do better.</p>



<p>Repeat, for life.</p>



<p>Recently I read a post by a coach and teacher I respect, Kendra Cunov, on <a href="http://www.kendracunov.com/2019/06/13/getting-clear-on-commitment/">Getting Clear on Commitment</a>. It was thought-provoking, as always, and made me sit down and re-examine what I&#8217;m truly committed to. Not &#8220;I&#8217;m committed, but &#8230;&#8221; What I&#8217;m truly committed to.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve done this before, notably last December when I was doing an annual re-examination of my life and commitments. It&#8217;s always useful to re-examine what you&#8217;re committed to, and to re-commit. But as the year has progressed, it&#8217;s become clear that I&#8217;m only truly committed to some of the things on my list.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve been spending some time looking at what makes me truly committed in one area (my family, for example), and not so committed in another (reading books).</p>



<p>What I&#8217;ve found is that <strong>when I&#8217;m truly committed, there is a deeper feeling, in my gut, that there is no way I&#8217;m going to fail at the commitment</strong>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not, &#8220;I really want to fulfill this commitment&#8221; &#8230; instead, it&#8217;s, &#8220;There is no question in my mind I&#8217;m going to fulfill it.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I feel discomfort and have an urge to put off the commitment, if I&#8217;m not really committed, I&#8217;ll justify putting it off. If I&#8217;m truly committed, there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that I&#8217;ll make it happen.</p>



<p>To paraphrase a teacher of mine, if I&#8217;m committed, I become a man who would walk through walls to make it happen.</p>



<p>What are you truly committed to? Are you willing to walk through walls for it? Is there no question in your mind that you&#8217;ll do it?</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not fully committed, you have three choices:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Keep being half-committed</strong>. This is what most of us do. I don&#8217;t recommend this at all. It saps you of energy. It makes you feel like committing to something isn&#8217;t really important. It makes others trust you less. It makes you trust yourself less. Instead, do one of the two next options.</li><li><strong>Let go of the commitment</strong>. This is the best option in many cases. Let go without judgment. It&#8217;s OK to not be committed to everything — in fact, it&#8217;s impossible to be committed to every single thing you want to do. It&#8217;s better to be committed to fewer things, but more deeply. So examine a half-commitment, and ask whether you want to make this one of your few commitments, or whether it&#8217;s worth letting go. If you don&#8217;t feel you&#8217;d walk through walls for this, let it go without guilt. Like you&#8217;re letting go of a caged bird.</li><li><strong>Deepen your commitment</strong>. For only a small number of things (maybe 4-6), you want to be truly committed. There is no question in your mind that these things will happen. If you are only partly there, don&#8217;t fret. You can deepen. We&#8217;ll look at that in the next section.</li></ol>



<p>So let go of the habit of being half-committed, and either let go of a half-commitment (best option, usually), or deepen to true commitment.</p>



<h3>How to Deepen</h3>



<p>For me, the process of deepening commitments this year has looked something like this:</p>



<ul><li>Commit to it, including committing to other people that I&#8217;ll do it.</li><li>Create a structure to hold me in that commitment even when things get tough. (This includes a &#8220;Sacred Council&#8221; who I email every week.)</li><li>Things go well, I&#8217;m on track, I feel great. I report weekly to my Sacred Council, things are awesome.</li><li>Then I get busy and some of the commitments fall off or are put temporarily on hold. I justify it to myself.</li><li>I re-examine my commitment — from how things have gone, it becomes apparent that I&#8217;m not as committed as I thought. I get clear on how I&#8217;m showing up and where I need to deepen my commitment.</li><li>Then I spend some time reflecting on this commitment. I deepen it inside of my heart.</li></ul>



<p>At this point, I spend some time deliberating and meditating. My deepening session goes a bit like this:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Go for a walk in nature</strong>. I&#8217;ve found that solitude in nature, especially while moving, is ideal. I also will find a rock or log to sit on and find stillness. But first I like to walk, to get the blood circulating. The solitude creates space to more deeply deliberate. No phone.</li><li><strong>Ask myself, &#8220;Am I truly committed to this? Would I do just about anything possible to make this happen?&#8221;</strong> This is a gut check. Feeling deep inside myself to understand how much I care about this.</li><li><strong>Ask myself, &#8220;Why do I care deeply about this?&#8221;</strong> Is it because of my love for my family? Love for the people I serve? Compassion for others&#8217; pain? If it&#8217;s a self-centered reason, I&#8217;m less likely to walk through walls to stroke my ego. If it&#8217;s to serve the world or people I love, I&#8217;m much more likely to walk through walls. I&#8217;d do anything for my kids. And my discomfort is so much less important than the people I care about.</li><li><strong>Firm my resolve</strong>. If I&#8217;m truly committed, I need to feel it in my gut. Even more, I need to feel it in my heart. This is a matter of feeling into my heart for the love that I feel deeply. And how much more important this is than my self-concern.</li><li><strong>Ask what I need to do to make this happen</strong>. Now that I&#8217;m resolved, I ask what steps need to happen to make this a reality. If I&#8217;m committed to impeccable structure for my family&#8217;s finances, what actions need to happen?</li></ol>



<p>This isn&#8217;t an exact science, but I&#8217;m hoping you can see through this example that it&#8217;s a process of searching your heart for what you care most deeply about, and what your heart&#8217;s priorities are.</p>



<p>Deepen your commitments for the sake of the people you love most.</p>

<h4>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h4>



<p>I was talking with a friend yesterday who is going through a very hard time, and of all the emotions that have come up for them during this struggle (anger, despair, etc.), shame has been the most challenging emotion of all.</p>



<p>We all feel shame, and it&#8217;s perfectly OK to feel it. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with us if we feel shame — it&#8217;s a very human emotion.</p>



<p>But it isn&#8217;t very helpful in most situations, and so we can bring mindfulness to bear on the shame. And practice letting it go.</p>



<p>Before we can let go, it&#8217;s worthwhile to mindfully work with our shame.</p>



<h3>What Shame Shows Us</h3>



<p>When I said shame isn&#8217;t very helpful, I didn&#8217;t tell the full truth — actually, it&#8217;s very useful, <em>in showing us what we think about ourselves</em>.</p>



<p>When we feel shame, it usually is because <strong>we&#8217;ve done something that we think says something shameful about us</strong>. And so it shows us where we believe there is something wrong about us, something inadequate, ugly, unworthy of love.</p>



<p>Of course, that belief is not true. But in order to let go of that ingrained belief, we have to see it first. Shame shows us where that belief lies hidden.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll give some examples from my own life:</p>



<ul><li>I&#8217;ve been overeating lately (an old habit of mine), which has led me to feeling overweight and not sexy. This has brought up feelings of shame about my body and lack of discipline. The shame says that I believe I&#8217;m ugly and undisciplined, and therefore inadequate and unworthy of love.</li><li>I went through a very busy period lately where I dropped all of my cherished habits for a few weeks, like exercise and meditation and accountability. This brought up shame for not (again) being disciplined, but also not practicing what I preach. The shame says that I believe I&#8217;m undisciplined, an imposter, inadequate.</li><li>I felt a lot of shame when I fell into debt. This brought up shame that showed my belief of being bad at finances, bad at taking care of my family, bad at being a father and provider. And again, inadequacy and unworthiness of being loved.</li></ul>



<p> In the end, the core belief is that we are inadequate and unworthy of being loved. But the reason we believe those is that we believe we haven&#8217;t lived up to some expectation: being successful, being lean, being disciplined, being generous, being a contributor to society, being environmentally conscious, etc. The expectations are in our minds, but they were given to us by society&#8217;s messaging, since birth. These expectations and beliefs are not so solid as we believe. Once we can see them, we can bring mindfulness practices to work with them. </p>



<h3>Mindfully Working with the Beliefs That Cause Shame </h3>



<p>It can be helpful to write down the beliefs that are causing us to feel shame, or to speak them aloud (perhaps to another person, like a trusted friend or therapist). Getting them out of our heads helps us to get clear on them. And sometimes saying them out loud can make them feel a little silly. I&#8217;ve found that true for myself — saying a belief out loud to another person takes away some of its power, maybe shows me how hard I am on myself. </p>



<p>So once we&#8217;ve said it out loud or written it down, let&#8217;s look at how to bring mindfulness practices into the equation:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Let yourself feel the shame</strong>. We don&#8217;t often let ourselves actually feel this emotion, because we don&#8217;t like it. Instead, open your heart and actually feel the shame in your body. Be curious about it: what does it feel like? Where is it located in your body? What temperature, texture, flavor does it have? See it with brand new eyes, with beginner&#8217;s mind.</li><li><strong>Ask yourself whether the belief is true</strong>. If you believe you&#8217;re undisciplined, ask youself, &#8220;Is it true that I&#8217;m undisciplined?&#8221; It might feel very true and solid, but in asking this question, let there be space for the possibility that it&#8217;s not true at all, or at least not completely true. Have you ever been a little disciplined? Are there examples you can point to where the belief wasn&#8217;t entirely true? Let the belief feel less solid.</li><li><strong>See your basic goodness</strong>. If at the heart of our shame is the belief that we&#8217;re somehow inadequate, not good enough … then it&#8217;s worthwhile to see that actually we are good. We have a basic goodness at our core. <a href="https://zenhabits.net/basicgoodness/">Do this meditation on your basic goodness</a>, and start to trust that this goodness is there all the time.</li><li><strong>Give yourself compassion &amp; love</strong>. If you have a belief that you are unworthy of love … you can immediately disprove that by giving yourself love. First, practice the muscle of love &amp; compassion by feeling it for someone else. Imagine someone you love dearly, and picture them having difficulty — send them compassion, a genuine wish for their suffering to end, a genuine wish for their happiness. Feel what this feels like, and where it&#8217;s coming from in your heart. Next, try it for yourself: pour out the same feelings of love &amp; compassion from the same place in your heart, but towards yourself. You are suffering as well, and deserve your own love &amp; compassion. Feel how it feels, and let this be proof that you are worthy of love. </li></ul>



<p>If you practice in this way, you might start to loosen your beliefs that cause shame, and let yourself feel trust in your basic goodness and worthiness of love. And if you do that, the shame might start to drift away, not needed any longer. What would you be left with if you didn&#8217;t have  the shame?</p>
