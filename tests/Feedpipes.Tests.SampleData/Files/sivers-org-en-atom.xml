I was uncomfortable, unhappy, and restless.
I didn’t want to meet new people, because I felt I was giving the wrong impression.
Something wasn’t right.
It took me months to figure out the real problem:
My clothes don’t fit anymore!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Once I realized this, I had to decide what new clothes would fit the new me.
Like many of us, I looked to the style of glamorous and successful people.
I should wear what they wear since it works so well for them.
I tried on many of their outfits, but nothing fit.
That was really disappointing, because I thought that’s why they share their choices with the world — so we can do what they do.
I thought it would be that easy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, after a lot of searching, I found clothes that are just my size.
But I couldn’t get them on!
There was no room at all.
I’m embarrassed to say I overlooked something obvious.
&lt;strong&gt;
I was trying to wear new clothes on top of the old ones.
&lt;/strong&gt;
I didn’t realize I had to completely remove my old clothes before putting on something new.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It was easy to take off my old clothes for a few days, but just having them around made it too easy to put them on again.
They were so comfortable!
I’d been wearing these things for so many years that they really became my identity.
If you put my old clothes on a mannequin, it would look like me.
What does that say about me, then?
We are what we wear?
Clothes make the man?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, I had to completely discard them.
It was sad — I thought those clothes would last forever.
I documented them for archive’s sake, then gave them away.
I’m glad someone else can use them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In this transition, before I put on my new clothes, I’m naked.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It feels weird.
I’m surprised I’m allowed to go out like this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Old friends hardly notice, but new people I meet are confused and can’t tell why I’m not wearing something.
&lt;strong&gt;
An outfit would show them how I can help.
&lt;/strong&gt;
(And that’s all most people want to know.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
A power suit would show I can help their business.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
A monk’s robe would imply I could help their soul.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Explorer’s gear would prove I could lead an adventure.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
A clown costume might at least make them laugh.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But nothing at all?
They probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/useless&quot;&gt;can’t use me&lt;/a&gt; for anything.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I get invited to speak at events, but it’s clear that what they want is the outfit I used to wear.
I explain that it doesn’t fit, but they’re upset that I won’t put it on just one more time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Don’t worry — I’m not going to be a nudist now.
That’s inconsiderate to almost everyone.
I’ll put on my new clothes soon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I’m just sharing this story in case your discomfort might just be that your old clothes don’t fit anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
P.S. (Added a day later.)
I need to re-write this to make it clear that it’s all a metaphor.
This actually has nothing to do with clothing.
Clothes are a metaphor for my identity and lifestyle - which don’t fit my current preferences.
I let go of my old identity before putting on a new one, which leaves me feeling a bit naked and not as useful to others.
My actual non-metaphorical clothes are fine.
&lt;/p&gt;

Like everyone, I live in a little house with many doors and windows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One door goes out to my neighborhood.
The local kids come to play with my dog.
The elderly neighbors take so long to tell me their stories.
I slow down my inner clock to listen.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One window looks out at the nature around me.
I’m getting to know this one tree really well.
I toss a little dog food out there each day, and watch the local birds and rodents come by to eat it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One door is just for my son.
This door goes somewhere new every time he opens it.
I pause what I’m doing and follow him on an adventure.
My inner clock stops working through that door.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One door goes to my connections — the people around the world with mutual interests.
A dozen people a day knock on this door and say hello.
Sometimes more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One hidden door is for my dearest friends.
That one comes all the way inside, anytime.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One skylight looks far into the future.
I daydream there a lot.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One little locket looks at the past.
I daydream there, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But one door is really no fun to open.
Whenever I do, I’m horrified at all the shouting.
It’s an infinite dark room filled with psychologically tortured people, trying to get attention.
Strangers screaming at strangers, starting fights.
Businesses put windows there, showing bad things said and done today, because they make money when people get mad.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They say I’m supposed to open that door, because that’s the real world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But it seems a lot less real than what’s in the other doors and windows in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;

I rarely cry, but I cried a lot last month, leaving New Zealand.
I’ve never loved and felt so connected to a place before.
It wasn’t simple sadness that made me cry, but overflowing appreciation.
I’d been feeling it for years, almost every day, amazed at not just the nature but the people and way of life.
Knowing I was leaving made me re-play all my memories from my last six years.
Most of that time spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/pa&quot;&gt;playing in the wilderness with my kid&lt;/a&gt;.
The memories are so overwhelmingly wonderful that seeing them all together like that made me sob with appreciation.
They’ve been the happiest years of my life.
Leaving felt like tearing a child from its mother.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So why did I leave?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/mfg&quot;&gt;moving is good&lt;/a&gt; for the mind.
I like seeing the world from different perspectives.
I usually get where I’m going by leaving where I’ve been.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been on a semi-sabbatical for the last six years, and ready to make a change.
I felt like being in the middle of things again, but a different middle than before.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve never really lived in Europe.
I have a list of places in Europe that I’m curious to get to know — places I’ve learned about but have never visited.
The list has 51 places on it already.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Munich would have been a more practical travel hub, but Oxford has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanwhite/43-reasons-living-in-oxford-ruins-you-for-life&quot;&gt;wonderful charm&lt;/a&gt; to it.
A &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/dj&quot;&gt;search of my diary&lt;/a&gt; showed I’ve been thinking about moving to Oxford since 2007.
Whenever I visited, it always felt just right.
So I finally did it.
I moved to Oxford England a month ago today, with everything I own in three suitcases.
(My kid had another two suitcases, and one of them was just Lego.)
I’m now a legal resident, and plan to stay here for twelve years — until my son is done with school.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The locals think I’m crazy for leaving the paradise of New Zealand for this.
But while New Zealand has a physical beauty that’s more visceral, Oxford has an intellectual beauty that I was craving.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So here I am.
And I’ll be all around Europe often, getting to know it well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Oscar Wilde:&lt;i&gt;
“Oxford still remains the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life and art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one.”
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Henry James:&lt;i&gt;
“Oxford lends sweetness to labor and dignity to leisure.”
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You know those people whose lives are transformed by meditation or yoga or something like that?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For me, it’s writing in my diary and journals.
It’s made all the difference in the world for my learning, reflecting, and peace of mind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After 20+ years of doing this, here’s what I do and recommend:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
A daily diary
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If digital, use only plain text.
It’s a standard format not owned by any company.
It will be readable in 50 years on devices we haven’t even imagined yet.
Don’t use formats that can only be read by one program, because that program won’t be around in 50 years.
Don’t use the cloud, unless you’re also going to download it weekly and back it up in plain text outside that cloud.
(Companies shut down. Clouds disappear. Think long-term.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
Every day at some point, just open up this diary, write today’s date, then start writing.
&lt;/strong&gt;
Write what you did today, and how you are feeling, even if it seems boring.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It works best as a nightly routine.
Just take a few minutes and write at least a few sentences.
If you have time, write down everything on your mind.
Clear it all out.
But if you miss a night, make time the next morning to write about the previous day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is important because years from now you might be looking back, wondering if you were as happy or as sad as you remember during this time.
So don’t only write the drama or dilemmas.
Include the daily facts of life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We so often make big decisions in life based on predictions of how we think we’ll feel in the future, or what we’ll want.
Your past self is your best indicator of how you actually felt in similar situations.
So it helps to have an accurate picture of your past.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can’t trust distant memories, but you can trust your daily diary.
It’s the best indicator to your future self (and maybe descendants) of what was really going on in your life at this time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re feeling you don’t have the time or it’s not interesting enough, remember:
&lt;strong&gt;
You’re doing this for your future self.
&lt;/strong&gt;
Future you will want to look back at this time in your life, and find out what you were actually doing, day-to-day, and how you really felt back then.
It will help you make better decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just put aside a few minutes to write what you did and how you felt today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“Thoughts On” journals
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are certain subjects in your life you think about a lot.
People, places, hobbies, health, plans, finances. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
For each subject that you might have ongoing thoughts about, start a separate “Thoughts On” journal.
&lt;/strong&gt;
Whenever you have some thoughts on this subject, open up that file, write today’s date, then start writing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To give you an example, here are my “Thoughts On” journals as of today:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I find it so useful to keep my thoughts on each subject together, because I can see my past thoughts and current thoughts in one place.
I can see how my thoughts on this subject have evolved or keep repeating.
Sometimes I think I have a new thought on a subject, so I open up the file and write it down, then afterwards I see I had that same thought a year ago and had forgotten about it.
&lt;strong&gt;
If you care about your thoughts, keep them.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They can be tiny.
Like you see I have one on airports.
I don’t have many thoughts on airports.
I don’t fly that much.
But I found that once or twice a year, when waiting at the gate, I had thoughts on the subject, so I’d open that file and start writing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve considered making one for every musician, album, book, or film that’s had an impact on me, that I’d like to think more about.
Why not?
I admire the way that a good critic puts in hours of reflection on each piece, thinking deeper about something they’ve just taken in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I especially like my “Regrets” journal.
Whenever I do something I regret, I write it down there, noting why I regret it, what I wish I would have done instead, and how I hope to prevent this in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Ask yourself questions, then question your answers.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whether in your daily diary, or the “Thoughts On” journals, I find the single most useful thing has been using it as a place to ask myself questions, and answer them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If I’m planning on doing something, I ask myself what I hope to get out of it, why, and whether there are other ways to get what I want.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When I’m feeling conflicted, especially, I’ll ask myself a bunch of questions to work through my feelings, looking for the source of the conflict, then ask myself more questions around the clash in values, and work through other alternate ways I’d like things to be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
I answer with my initial thought first, but then question it afterwards with skepticism, and consider different perspectives.
&lt;/strong&gt;
I hear this is similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy&quot;&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; — and I’ve been meaning to learn more about that.
But whatever you call it, I think it’s been the single most important thing to my intellectual and emotional development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Almost all the thoughts I have on any subject are the result of writing in my diary and journals, then questioning myself and working through alternate ways of thinking about it, and finally returning to the subject days or months later with a clear head and updated thoughts, seeing how they’ve changed or not over time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hope it helps you too.
&lt;/p&gt;

Life can be improved by adding, or by subtracting.
The world pushes us to add, because that benefits them.
But the secret is to focus on subtracting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Imagine a number line, with 0 on the left and 20 on the right.
Say I want to be in the middle, at 10.
But I’m at 17.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/numberline2-600.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“What can I add to get to 10? I tried adding 8 but that didn’t work. Maybe 3 would help. I should go all out and add 50.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/numberline3-600.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No amount of adding will get me to where I want to be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The adding mindset is deeply ingrained.
&lt;strong&gt;
It’s easy to think I need something else.
It’s hard to look instead at what to remove.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The least successful people I know run in conflicting directions, are drawn to distractions, say yes to almost everything, and are chained to emotional obstacles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The most successful people I know have a narrow focus, protect themselves against time-wasters, say no to almost everything, and have let go of old limiting beliefs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
More people die from eating too much than from eating too little.
Most of us have too much baggage, too many commitments, and too many priorities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Subtracting reminds me that what I need to change is something already here, not out there.

David grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, with five brothers and sisters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When he was 18, he got accepted to a very prestigious art school in Vienna.
Vienna!
This was his dream come true!
He had wanted this so badly, but never thought he’d actually get accepted.
This was an amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But his mother was on her death bed.
An undiagnosable illness seemed like it was going to take her at any time.
All of her children were visiting her every day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When he mentioned that he got accepted to the art school in Vienna, everyone said, “Well of course you can’t go! You need to stay here with your mother during her final days!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He was very conflicted and felt horrible about this, but still felt that he had to accept the offer.
So he moved to Vienna.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His mother disowned him.
His brothers and sisters screamed about his selfishness, and didn’t speak to him for years.
Everybody told him what a horrible person he was.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
David told his story at the age of 38 and said, “&lt;strong&gt;And now, 20 years later, my mother is still alive.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve followed my dreams, had a great career and an amazing life, while my brothers and sisters have given up their whole lives to stay by my mother’s bed, still to this day.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The David in this story is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Seabury&quot;&gt;David Seabury&lt;/a&gt;, who changed thousands of people’s lives.
It’s from his book “The Art of Selfishness”, which I found on my grandmother’s bookshelf when I was 18.
I’ve thought about it constantly since then.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Years ago, I was so confident and so naive.
I was sure I was right and everyone else was wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After I &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/done&quot;&gt;sold my company&lt;/a&gt;, I felt ready to do something new, so I started to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book&quot;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt;.
But the more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew and how dumb-lucky I had been.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I continued learning until I felt like an absolute idiot.
By then I was paralyzed, unable to create anything new.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’d &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/projects&quot;&gt;start to make new things&lt;/a&gt;, but then see how stupid they revealed me to be, so I’d stop.
I lost all confidence.
I spent a few years completely stuck.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, some new thoughts helped:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
Learning without doing is wasted.
&lt;/strong&gt;
If I don’t use what I learn, then it was pointless!
How horrible to waste those hundreds of hours I spent learning, and not turn it into action.
Like throwing good food in the trash, it’s morally wrong.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/you-not-them&quot;&gt;
This isn’t about me.
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
How I feel in this moment doesn’t matter — it will pass.
Nobody’s judging me because nobody’s thinking of me.
They’re just looking for ways to improve their own lives.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/publicu&quot;&gt;The public me is not the real me&lt;/a&gt; anyway, so if they judge my public persona, that’s fine.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
The work is the point, and my work is unique.
&lt;/strong&gt;
If I can do something that people find useful, then I should.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a masterpiece or not, as long as I enjoy it.
I’ve got my own weird angle on things that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/counter&quot;&gt;a useful counter-melody&lt;/a&gt; in the big orchestra of life.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m glad my old confidence is gone because it thought I was right, and maybe even great, but not anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now I aim to make my work — my little contribution to the world — just unique and useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

Things I learned in the past are now wrong.
Times have changed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Beliefs that were true are now false.
They were based on old limitations that are now gone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ways that used to work don’t work anymore.
The old road collapsed.
There’s a tunnel through the mountain now.
When the old map is wrong, we can’t just draw a new line on it — we need to get a new map or we’ll be following closed roads.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes the world is the same, but my situation has changed.
What got me here won’t get me there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
The solution is deliberate unlearning.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Doubt what I know.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Stop the habit of thinking I know it.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Require current proof that it’s still true today.
Otherwise, let it go.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Where I had expertise before, I don’t now.
People ask my advice on things I knew well years ago.
It’s tempting to think I still know the answer, but instead I have to admit, “Sorry. I don’t know.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It hurts to go from feeling like an expert to feeling like an idiot.
But it’s crucial to go through that pain or I’ll never grow.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
John Cage said, “I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Alvin Toffler said, “The illiterates of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Many people learn only in their first third of life, so schools don’t teach unlearning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We want to see the world clearly and know what’s what.
But once we’re past the first stage of wisdom, the next stage involves adapting to new changes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We don’t get wise just by adding and adding.
We also need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/subtract&quot;&gt;subtract&lt;/a&gt;.

Most of us have lives filled with mediocrity.
We said yes to things that we felt half-hearted about.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So we’re too busy to react when opportunities come our way.
We miss out on the great because we’re busy with the mediocre.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The solution is to say yes to less.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re not feeling “Hell yeah, that would be awesome!” about something, say no.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s an easier decision.
&lt;strong&gt;
Say no to almost everything.
&lt;/strong&gt;
This starts to free your time and mind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then, when you find something you’re actually excited about, you’ll have the space in your life to give it your full attention.
You’ll be able to take massive action, in a way that most people can’t, because you cleared away your clutter in advance.
&lt;strong&gt;
Saying no makes your yes more powerful.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Though it’s good to say yes when you’re starting out, wanting any opportunity, or needing variety, it’s bad to say yes when you’re overwhelmed, over-committed, or need to focus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Refuse almost everything.
Do almost nothing.
But the things you do, do them all the way.

In my last book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/a&quot;&gt;Anything You Want&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, I told the story of how I started, grew, and sold my company.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As part of selling the company, I signed a non-compete agreement that said I couldn’t do the one thing I’d been doing since I was twenty-seven years old.
So I had to make a real change in my life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I thought a lot about &lt;strong&gt;what’s worth doing, fixing faulty thinking, and making things happen&lt;/strong&gt;.
For the next ten years, I wrote for hours a day in my private journal, asking myself questions and answering them.
When these thoughts seemed useful to others, I’d turn them into articles, which are now the chapters of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/n&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I write succinctly because I’m only introducing ideas.
You can apply them to your life better than I can.
But if you want to hear more thoughts or talk about them, go to the URL at the end of each chapter:
&lt;strong&gt;
(sivers.org/_____)
&lt;/strong&gt;
There you’ll find many interesting comments about that idea, and you can post your own.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Or just say hello at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/contact&quot;&gt;sivers.org/contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
I love hearing from people who have found my work.
I reply to every email.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
The only operating system I use on my computers is &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/itunes&quot;&gt;not Mac&lt;/a&gt;, not Windows, and not even Linux.
It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbsd.org/&quot;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, and I love it so much.
So I figured I should say a little something about why, and how you can try it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
It’s probably not for you.
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s not for beginners.
Most people should use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s not for people who want to click a button and have the computer hide the details from you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If software bloat doesn’t bother you — if every new Mac/Windows/Linux release you say, “Bring on the features! The more the better!” — it’s not for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you’re experienced, like to “look under the hood”, and prefer software that does the minimum necessary, OpenBSD is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
What is it?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s like Linux, but has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbsd.org/goals.html&quot;&gt;different goals&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s known for its focus on security.
But, like a well-engineered house will also be earthquake-proof, you don’t have to be paranoid about earthquakes to appreciate great construction.
To me, the security features are just a side-effect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbsd.org/security.html&quot;&gt;great coding&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
OpenBSD comes with a secure minimal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nostarch.com/pf3&quot;&gt;firewall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/httpd.html&quot;&gt;webserver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensmtpd.org/&quot;&gt;mailserver&lt;/a&gt;, and an optional graphical &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xenocara.org/&quot;&gt;desktop&lt;/a&gt;.
So if all you want is a few of those things, you do the default install, tweak one config file, and you’re done.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Why OpenBSD instead of Linux?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s &lt;strong&gt;uncompromising&lt;/strong&gt;.
It’s not a people-pleaser or vendor-pleaser.
Linux is in everything from Android phones to massive supercomputers, so has to include features for all of them.
The OpenBSD developers say no to most things.
Instead of trying to make it do more, they keep it focused on doing what it does with more security and reliability.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They &lt;strong&gt;review and remove&lt;/strong&gt; code as often as they add.
If something is unused, unmaintained, or unnecessary, they’ll axe it.
If it’s unwieldy, they’ll make a &lt;strong&gt;small simple replacement&lt;/strong&gt;.
For examples, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://https.www.google.com.tedunangst.com/flak/post/doas&quot;&gt;doas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensmtpd.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSMTPD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8&quot;&gt;httpd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libressl.org/&quot;&gt;LibreSSL&lt;/a&gt;.
This is great for security, too.
The more code, the more chance of a bug that could compromise your entire computer.
The less code, the better.
Each new release seems to be getting &lt;strong&gt;leaner&lt;/strong&gt; by removing old cruft.
No other operating system does that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Great &lt;strong&gt;documentation&lt;/strong&gt; is a top priority.
The built-in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page&quot;&gt;man pages&lt;/a&gt; are amazing.
So if you’re stuck on anything, &lt;a href=&quot;http://man.openbsd.org/apropos.1&quot;&gt;searching&lt;/a&gt; the man pages on your own computer is going to give you a better answer than searching Google.
(This makes it nicer to work offline, too.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;strong&gt;installers&lt;/strong&gt; are amazing.
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html&quot;&gt;initial installation&lt;/a&gt; takes like five minutes.
Hit [Enter] to the defaults, make your username and password, and it’s ready to go.
Then the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html&quot;&gt;software installer&lt;/a&gt; is ideal, too.
Just &lt;a href=&quot;https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_info.1&quot;&gt;pkg_info&lt;/a&gt; to search for something and &lt;a href=&quot;http://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1&quot;&gt;pkg_add&lt;/a&gt; to install it in seconds.
(Which also installs all of its documentation, too.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everything is rock-solid and &lt;strong&gt;just works&lt;/strong&gt;.
Hardware I couldn’t get working in Linux just works on a first try with OpenBSD.
And because they don’t stay cutting-edge, keeping a cautious pace, it keeps working and doesn’t break.
The whole system is carefully planned and consistent, instead of a hodge-podge of bits and pieces.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s all free and run by helpful volunteers.
If you &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/&quot;&gt;searched ports&lt;/a&gt;, but some application you need is missing or out of date, just contact the maintainer and offer some assistance or money to help get it updated or added.
I’ve donated $3850 to the developers to help improve the OpenBSD port of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://elixir-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erlang.org/&quot;&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ledger-cli.org/&quot;&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qutebrowser.org/&quot;&gt;Qutebrowser&lt;/a&gt;.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
At &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book&quot;&gt;sivers.org/book&lt;/a&gt; I have a collection of my notes from the 250+ books I’ve read since 2007.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This page is just to answer some questions about it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
My notes are not a summary of the book!
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When I’m reading and come across a surprising or inspiring idea, I save it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That’s all my notes are.
I’m not summarizing the book.
&lt;strong&gt;
I’m just saving ideas for myself, for later reflection.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If I’m reading a book about a subject I already know well, I’ll have very few notes, because not much surprised me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I kept these notes private for years, but decided it couldn’t hurt to put them on my site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Notes don’t replace the book
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It makes me sad when people email to say thanks for my notes because it saved them time from reading the book.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My notes are just some tiny tidbits with no context.
&lt;strong&gt;
It’s like reading a punchline without the joke.
&lt;/strong&gt;
If you hear an elaborate joke, then the punchline — (“The little piece of rope said, ‘No. I’m a frayed knot!’”) — is all you need to remember the full joke.
But if you just hear the punchline, without the joke, it makes no sense.
I just save the punchlines to remind myself what I’ve read.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Again: these notes are really just for me but I’m sharing them on my site.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you look through a book’s notes and like the ideas, please go read the whole book.
It gives so much more context and meaning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“How do you choose the rating?”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My 0-10 rating is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just how much I liked the book.
It’s how strongly I would recommend it to almost anyone.
So a great book about an obscure subject, like the culture of Switzerland, would get a low rating even if I loved it, because I wouldn’t recommend it to most people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“How do you use these notes?”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This will always be changing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For the past few years, when I have a few minutes, I’ll just pick some book from the past that might apply to a situation I’m working on now, and re-read all the notes on it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve also used them to research a certain subject, like discipline for example, I’ll go search all notes for any mention of discipline, and re-read the thoughts on that subject.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Eventually instead of them being saved in a single text file per-book, I’m going to feed each individual idea into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.sivers.org/db-api/lat/&quot;&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;, tagged, so I can use some interesting lateral thinking tools.
I set up the software to do this, but it’s going to be very time consuming, because most ideas will need editing to become stand-alone ideas, not needing the context of the notes before and after them.
So for 250 books, about 100 ideas per book, that’s 25,000 ideas I need to edit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“Why don’t I see __(some book)___?”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do read fiction, but I don’t take notes on it.
For fiction, I prefer audiobook.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I also read hundreds of books before 2007, but didn’t start taking notes until I realized I was forgetting what I had read.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And ultimately, I only read things that apply to my life or current interests right now.
I say no to all requests, and publishers asking me to do reviews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“Which one should I read?”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whichever one seems to apply to your current situation.
I find books most useful when they solve a problem I’m having now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By default I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book&quot;&gt;the list&lt;/a&gt; sorted with my top recommendations up top.
But really the best one for you is the one that speaks to your current situation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“Don’t the authors get mad?”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No, but this was my biggest surprise!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The main reason I didn’t post these for years is because I assumed it was against copyright law.
But I quietly tried it, without announcing it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then as the site got more popular, I was scared I’d get in trouble, but instead I got emails of thanks from the authors of those books.
Maybe especially since I really am trying to get people to go buy the books whose notes they like.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“Exactly how do you take these notes?”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When reading a paper book, I just underline or circle the bits I find surprising or useful.
Then when I’m done reading the book, I type those bits into a text file.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On Kindle, I just highlight the bits I find surprising or useful.
Then when I’m done reading the book, I connect the Kindle by USB, copy the «/documents/My Clippings.txt» file, and edit from there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Either way, I tend to edit a lot, and re-shape the sentences into something that works for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
“Hey you might like this other book summary site!”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No.
I don’t want to read summaries of books.
I like reading the whole book!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I aim to read even harder books, like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book/HowToReadABook&quot;&gt;How to Read a Book&lt;/a&gt;” describes well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/book&quot;&gt;sivers.org/book&lt;/a&gt; to browse the notes.

You are the way you are because of what you’ve experienced.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your country, family, town, random circumstances, and friends have shaped the way you think.
If you had grown up on the other side of the world, you would have a different set of values and thought patterns.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you keep experiencing the same things, your mind keeps its same patterns.
Same inputs, same responses.
Your brain, which was once curious and growing, gets fixed into deep habits.
Your values and opinions harden and resist change.
If you don’t flex, you lose your flexibility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You really learn only when you’re surprised.
If you’re not surprised, then everything is fitting into your existing thought patterns.
&lt;strong&gt;
So to get smarter, you need to get surprised, think in new ways, and deeply understand different perspectives.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With effort, you could do this from the comfort of home.
But the most effective way to shake things up is to move across the world.
Pick a place that’s most unlike what you know, and go.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This keeps you in a learning mindset.
Previously mindless habits, like buying groceries, now keep your mind open, alert, and noticing new things.
New arrivals in a culture often notice what the locals don’t.
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://sivers.org/fish&quot;&gt;Fish don’t know they’re in water.&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Don’t think of yourself as visiting.
Say that you’ve moved here, and mean it.
Commit.
Immerse.
Go native.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Form deep friendships with locals.
Ask lots of questions.
Ask people to explain and show you how things are done.
When they state a fact, ask how they know.
When they state an opinion, ask for examples.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At first, their values and methods will feel wrong.
You’ll feel the urge to tell them how their lives or ideas could be better — more like what you know.
But try to understand a perspective where they are right and you are wrong.
&lt;strong&gt;
Eventually you’ll realize that your beliefs were not correct — they were just the local culture of where you grew up.
&lt;/strong&gt;
You’re a product of your environment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Every country has a shared and working philosophy.
Dive in and really try to understand it.
This is one of the best things you can do for your brain.
Stay immersed at least until you feel yourself saying “we” instead of “they.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then, if you want to keep your brain actively learning and growing forever, keep moving across the world and immersing yourself like this for the rest of your life.
&lt;/p&gt;

I tried Facebook for a few weeks in 2007, but I hadn’t really used it since then.
I would log in once a month for a few minutes and click [ACCEPT] to all the friend requests from strangers, then log out.
I hit the 5000 friend-limit, so I created a second profile.
That hit the 5000 friend-limit too, so I created a third.
When the third one hit the friend-limit, I stopped.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I thought I was just being polite, accepting friend requests, but I didn’t know who most of them were.
&lt;strong&gt;
It was very insincere.
&lt;/strong&gt;
When real friends would ask if I’m on Facebook, I’d have to explain, “It looks like I’m there, but not really there.”
I never posted anything personal, and never installed it on my phone.
I was really just using it to announce new blog posts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When people would do their “&lt;a href=&quot;https://deletefacebook.com/&quot;&gt;DELETE FACEBOOK!&lt;/a&gt;” campaigns, I didn’t bother because I wasn’t using it anyway.
&lt;strong&gt;
It was causing me no harm.
&lt;/strong&gt;
I think it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=facebook&amp;amp;sites=calnewport.com&amp;amp;ia=web&quot;&gt;net-negative for the world, and causing many people harm&lt;/a&gt;, but not me, so why bother deleting it?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
But the more I thought about it, the less I liked my implied support.
&lt;/strong&gt;
I’m sick of being insincere.
I’m against centralized platforms.
I strongly prefer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/&quot;&gt;decentralized internet&lt;/a&gt;.
I’m always helping friends get off of the big platforms and on to their own servers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Maybe the fact that I use Facebook to share my blog posts is a tiny tiny reason why others are still using it.
It’s like I’m still visiting friends in the smoking area, even though I don’t smoke.
Maybe if I quit going entirely, it will help my friends quit, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
So I snapped out of the silly fear that people won’t find me if I’m not there.
&lt;/strong&gt;
If they care at all, they’ll find me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, yeah.
That decided it.
I deleted all three accounts with 15,000 “friends”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I had a selfish business reason to keep it.
I’m going to be publishing three different books over the next year, and plan to launch a new business, too.
&lt;strong&gt;
But I’m willing to take that small loss in promotion, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.seanbonner.com/2012/04/15/on-leaving-facebook/&quot;&gt;it’s the right thing to do&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/strong&gt;
It always feels good to get rid of things I’m not using.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been online since 1994.
I remember when everyone thought mp3.com was everything, and a few years later it was gone.
Then everyone thought MySpace was everything, and a few years later it was moot.
Now it’s Facebook, Instagram, and Google, but eventually they’ll all be moot, too.
It’s the natural cycle of things.
&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a fable of a man stuck in a flood.
Convinced that God is going to save him, he says no to a passing canoe, boat, and helicopter that offer to help.
He dies, and in heaven asks God why He didn’t save him.
God says, “I sent you a canoe, a boat, and a helicopter!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We all have vivid imaginations.
We get a goal in our mind and picture the path so clearly.
Then it’s hard to stop focusing on that vivid image, to see what else could work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
New technologies make old things easier, and new things possible.
&lt;strong&gt;
That’s why you need to re-evaluate your old dreams to see if new means have come along.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some actors move to Hollywood hoping to get noticed.
Others use every new outlet to make themselves unavoidable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some authors are just waiting for a publisher to sign them.
Others are getting rich just self-publishing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You need to distinguish between what is your real goal, and what are the unnecessary details.
&lt;strong&gt;
Don’t let the details distract you from your goal.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For each of your dreams, occasionally ask yourself what the real point is.
Then look for a better way to get to that point.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let go of outdated dreams that keep you from noticing what’s here now.
&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone who is drawn to you before you’re famous is thinking the same thing:
&lt;strong&gt;
You might be famous soon!
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
fans who want to help you
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
professionals who want to meet you
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
musicians who want to play with you
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
companies that want to work with you
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They’re all hoping to be included in your glorious future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As you get more successful, share that success with those who helped you years ago.
When you’re in the tornado of fame, you can’t depend on your memory.
So use your database now to keep track of who has done special favors for you.
&lt;strong&gt;
When you are famous, return the favors.
&lt;/strong&gt;
Reach out to contact them, and invite them into your new world.
(Don’t wait for them to ask.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Those that gave their services for free?
Now you can pay full price.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Those who wanted glamour by association?
Invite them to the best party.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Those who deserve more recognition?
Shout their praises to your new audience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
You aren’t pulled to success by destiny.
You’re lifted there by those around you.
&lt;/strong&gt;
So acknowledge their contribution, and bring them along for the ride.

Write all of my thoughts on a subject.

Argue against those ideas.

Explore different angles until I’m sick of it.

Leave it for a few days or years, then repeat those steps.

Reduce them to a tiny outline of the key points.

When I was promoting myself as a musician, I noticed an interesting pattern.
If I had a good conversation with somebody in the music business, then quite often they would send an opportunity my way within a day or two.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In other words, when I look back at the random opportunities that came my way, they often came from someone who I had just spoken with a day or two before.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yes I just said this twice to emphasize it.
This is important.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Years later, when I was running CD Baby, various opportunities came up where someone asked me to recommend a musician.
I almost always recommended whichever musician I had just spoken with, since they came to mind first.
That’s why it’s so important to keep in touch.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There were some amazing musicians whose music I loved, so I contacted them to tell them I’m a huge fan, and would love to help however I can.
But if they didn’t keep in touch, they eventually fell out of my mind.
It’s unfortunate, but that’s life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There were some good (but not amazing) musicians who were great at keeping in touch.
So when opportunities came my way, guess who I thought of to recommend?
Yep.
That’s life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
The difference between success and failure can be as simple as keeping in touch. 
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It takes effort to meet people.
So once you’ve met someone, get the most out of the relationship for both of you.
Keep in touch.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is both fun and considerate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When people say that a movie has a great character, they mean it was someone especially shocking, funny, or honest.
To be a great entertainer, you need to be larger than life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Push your outer boundaries.
Show your weirdness.
Bring out all your quirks.
The world needs that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
Your public persona — the image you show the world — should be an extreme character.
&lt;/strong&gt;
It can be a version of yourself, or it can be a mask.
(It’s easier to be honest behind a mask.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some of the biggest musicians of the last few decades have admitted they were playing a character.
Eminem, for example, said he wrote lyrics with the goal of shocking a passive listener into paying attention.
Then he built his public persona to match the lyrics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Are you concerned that maybe you should play it safe, because your music isn’t so extreme?
Well… 
Think of the conservative, old-fashioned performers that your great-grandmother probably liked.
Frank Sinatra.
Judy Garland.
Miles Davis.
Billie Holiday.
Even these old legends were rather extreme.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
It’s more interesting for the audience if you’re the opposite of normal.
&lt;/strong&gt;
So be an extreme character.
The spotlight is the excuse.
You can get away with anything in the name of entertainment.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of the most useful lessons I’ve learned in life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When you don’t know your next step…
&lt;br/&gt;
When you’re feeling unmotivated…
&lt;br/&gt;
When asking someone to help you…
&lt;br/&gt;
When you’re ready to make a dream come true…
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
Get more specific about what’s needed.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are two ways to do it:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
#1: Write down every detail you know.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Inside your head, there is more than you’ve said.
Take the time to write it all down.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When you have a vague or distant goal — like “be a great singer” or “make a million from my music” — break it down into specific ingredients.
Describe concrete milestones, and exactly how to reach them.
Then break those down into actions that you can start doing today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When you’re feeling stuck or unmotivated, figure out your next step.
Even something as simple as finishing a song is easier when you realize exactly what’s wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When you hire someone to help you, write down absolutely everything you need them to do.
Include every detail of every step, and your philosophy too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
#2: Research what you don’t know.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most people know what they want, but don’t know how to get it.
When you don’t know the next step, you procrastinate or feel lost.
But a little research can turn a vague desire into specific actions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For example:
When musicians say, “I need a booking agent”, I ask, “Which one? What’s their name?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
You can’t act on a vague desire.
&lt;/strong&gt;
But with an hour of research you could find the names of ten booking agents that work with ten artists you admire.
Then you’ve got a list of the next ten people you need to contact.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A life coach told me that most of his job is just helping people get specific.
Once they turn a vague goal into a list of specific steps, it’s easy to take action.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
It also makes you realize if something was a bad idea.
&lt;/strong&gt;
Many things only sound nice in theory.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So do this for yourself.
Take the time to get specific. 
It helps you and others to take action, and beats procrastination.
&lt;/p&gt;
