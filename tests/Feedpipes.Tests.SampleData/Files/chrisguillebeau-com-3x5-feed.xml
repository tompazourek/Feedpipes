		<description><![CDATA[Magic is all around you. Maybe you’ve even made some magic of your own. <p></p>

What you might not realize is that there’s a formula for such a thing. This formula requires three conditions to be met before magic can occur: <p></p>

1. You have a crazy idea.
2. You can’t stop thinking about the crazy idea.
3. You decide to do something about it.<p></p>

Note that <em>all three conditions need to be met</em>. Merely meeting one or two of them isn’t sufficient. ]]></description>

<p>Magic is all around you. Maybe you’ve even made some magic of your own. </p>
<p>What you might not realize is that there’s a formula for such a thing. This formula requires three conditions to be met before magic can occur: </p>
<p>1. You have a crazy idea.<br />
2. You can’t stop thinking about the crazy idea.<br />
3. You decide to do something about it.</p>
<p>Note that <em>all three conditions need to be met</em>. Merely meeting one or two of them isn’t sufficient. </p>
<p>Everyone has crazy ideas. At least once in their life, everyone has a big dream. This tells us that having a crazy idea or big dream isn’t enough. </p>
<p>Most of us also have ideas that come and go. That’s fine and normal—but if your idea fails to turn into an obsession, you can’t make any magic. So you need an idea that won’t leave you alone. One that keeps you up at night and draws your attention when you’re trying to do other things. </p>
<p>Finally, you can have a crazy idea that you’re obsessed with &#8230; but if you don’t actually <em>do</em> anything about it, you’ll just end up disappointed and frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, you should ask how you can cultivate each of the three conditions in your life. </strong></p>
<p>First up is having enough crazy ideas to work with. These come from the dreamer in each of us. You have one, too, even if that part of you has been stifled or restrained. And even if you consider yourself “creative,” you still need to practice the art of coming up with ideas. </p>
<p>So start with a list. It could be a list of things you want to <em>do</em>, <em>become</em>, or <em>achieve</em>. It could be a <a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/how-to-write-a-life-list/">bucket list or life list of sorts</a>. Or it could just be a Very Short List of five goals. </p>
<p>At this stage, <em>unrealistic</em> is not a label you should apply to your ideas. Sure, if your idea is truly impossible, maybe you should cross it off your list. But as long as there is a possibility, however remote, that you could make your dream a reality, you shouldn’t dismiss it offhand. </p>
<img src="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/07/Magic2-700x465.jpeg" alt="Magic2" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-41878" srcset="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/07/Magic2-700x465.jpeg 700w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/07/Magic2-250x166.jpeg 250w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/07/Magic2-768x510.jpeg 768w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/07/Magic2-120x80.jpeg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />
<p><strong>Next is the obsession condition: where you can’t stop think thinking about your crazy idea. </strong></p>
<p>Before I started the blog, I went through a long season where I would wake up at night with ideas for posts. I kept a notebook by my bed and jotted down lines (usually in illegible handwriting&#8230;) in an attempt to remember them. Then, wherever I went during the day, I’d still be thinking about it. In the final two months before I finally hit the publish button for the first time, I thought about it every day. </p>
<p><strong>Finally, we come to the third, all-important condition: you have to do something about your obsessive idea. You have to make an active decision, and you have to get to work. </strong></p>
<p>So many people sabotage themselves at this stage. The world is full of people with wondrous, magical ideas who never let them out of their imagination. They remain stuck. They often end up getting mad at other people, or just disappointed in themselves. </p>
<p>To help with this stage: </p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself a deadline</li>
<li>Accept that &#8220;done is better than perfect&#8221; </li>
<li>Think about how you’ll feel if your dream actually came true</li>
<li>Think about how you’ll feel if you never do anything about it </li>
</ul>
<p>The last one has been particularly powerful for me. It might sound negative at first glance, but in my experience, thinking about regret is highly motivational. I knew I didn’t want to look back and say, “Yeah, I had an idea to do this thing … but then I got distracted.” Or “It might not have worked out, so I didn’t try.” No way! </p>
<p><strong>However you do it, you have to go from idea to obsession to action. This is the proven path; these are your three conditions. </strong></p>
<p>If you’re trying to decide whether you’ll be a dreamer or a do-er, there’s more good news: you can be both. And you should be. At least if you want to make ordinary magic. </p>
<p><strong>You are already capable of so much. So now the question becomes: what will you do next? </strong></p>

		<title>To Every Thing, A Season</title>

		<description><![CDATA[You probably know the song, the one that borrows its lyrics from the book of ‎Ecclesiastes: <em>to every thing, there is a season for every activity under the heavens. </em><p></p>

Seasons have been on my mind lately, as I’ve been transitioning from my busiest month of the year into a time of more focused creative work. I’m grateful for both of these seasons—I wouldn’t want to choose between them—but my life and work in each of them feels very different. <p></p>

In my creative work season, I’m working on a new book and I take joy in writing every day. I’m able to exercise more and feel less stressed about being behind on a million things. So is this fundamentally <em>better</em>? <p></p>

I don’t think so. Because last month I visited 14 cities, speaking to readers and the media about <a href="http://aonc.co/100side" rel="noopener" target="_blank">100 SIDE HUSTLES</a>—and then I hosted a weeklong event in Portland for 1,000 people. All of that was fun, too. Almost every day I thought, “Wow, I can’t believe I get to do this! I feel so fortunate.” <p></p>

<strong>The challenge comes if you try to apply the same rules of order or general expectations to each season. </strong>]]></description>

<p>You probably know the song, the one that borrows its lyrics from the book of ‎Ecclesiastes: <em>to every thing, there is a season for every activity under the heavens. </em></p>
<p>Seasons have been on my mind lately, as I’ve been transitioning from my busiest month of the year into a time of more focused creative work. I’m grateful for both of these seasons—I wouldn’t want to choose between them—but my life and work in each of them feels very different. </p>
<p>In my creative work season, I’m working on a new book and I take joy in writing every day. I’m able to exercise more and feel less stressed about being behind on a million things. So is this fundamentally <em>better</em>? </p>
<p>I don’t think so. Because last month I visited 14 cities, speaking to readers and the media about <a href="http://aonc.co/100side" rel="noopener" target="_blank">100 SIDE HUSTLES</a>—and then I hosted a weeklong event in Portland for 1,000 people. All of that was fun, too. Almost every day I thought, “Wow, I can’t believe I get to do this! I feel so fortunate.” </p>
<p><strong>The challenge comes if you try to apply the same rules of order or general expectations to each season. </strong></p>
<p>I still exercised every day during the busy month, and I was proud to keep up my streak (118 days in a row at the time I’m writing this). But aside from a few long runs on Sundays, that exercise was mostly &#8220;maintenance mode.&#8221; There were plenty of days when I traveled much of the day and had to scramble to get to the gym for a quick workout before my evening event. </p>
<p>Now I’m back to being active at least two hours a day, running, biking, taking HIIT and yoga classes, working with a trainer twice a week, and so on. It feels good. </p>
<p>Similarly, if I expected myself to be able to <a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/how-to-write-300000-words-in-1-year/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write 1,000 words a day</a> during the busy month, that would not have gone well. It was all I could do to record <a href="http://sidehustleschool.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the daily podcast</a> and stay afloat in general. </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I’m sometimes asked to advise people on “what they should do,” and I usually find this to be the wrong question. Or maybe it’s not the wrong question, but it would be wrong for me to answer it. </p>
<p>Most answers are not universal. My experience is different from yours; your life is your own. Furthermore, even if there are qualitatively good answers to the “what should you do with your life” questions, those answers may vary depending on season and circumstance. </p>
<p><strong>What I mean is this: the best course of action to take now may not be the best one tomorrow. </strong></p>
<p>Here’s a practical example. One of the most common questions I receive is, “When is the right time to quit my job?” (What the person usually means is “I hate my job; should I quit right now?”) </p>
<p>And I think, well, who am I to say! But to think about it in terms of those seasons: if you’re young, and your job sucks, why should you bother staying there? The cost of walking away is likely to be relatively low. </p>
<p><strong>In fact, the real risk is to end up wasting the prime of your life doing something you don’t enjoy. </strong></p>
<p>But if you’re a bit older, perhaps with a family, a mortgage, or other responsibilities that adult life brings, the answer might be different. You might need to be more strategic, build an off-ramp, keep a lookout for other options—but all without walking away immediately. </p>
<p>This isn’t to say that every young person should quit their job tomorrow, and everyone else should remain stuck forever in a job that sucks. It just means that there are seasons. <em>To every thing (turn, turn, turn) there is a season. To every time, there is a purpose. </em></p>
<p>Everything is temporary. What matters to you in this season?</p>

I’ve had a wonderful time visiting my first batch of cities for the 100 SIDE HUSTLES tour. I'm on to San Francisco next, and I hope to add several more stops before the summer is over. <p></p>

We now have more than 500 photos online, which you can access at the links below. I’ve also included a few of my favorite photos and memories (so far...) further down.<p></p>

<p>In <strong>Phoenix</strong>, I went to Changing Hands, the only bookstore aside from Powell’s in Portland that I’ve been to for all six of my books. It was a great opening night!</p>
<img src="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48001548807_ceaebb9c62_k-700x467.jpg" alt="100-Side-Hustles-Book-Tour-Changing-Hands-Bookstore" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-41850" srcset="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48001548807_ceaebb9c62_k-700x467.jpg 700w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48001548807_ceaebb9c62_k-250x167.jpg 250w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48001548807_ceaebb9c62_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48001548807_ceaebb9c62_k-120x80.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />
<p>In <strong>Austin</strong>, Brian Thompson gave me a cool laser-engraved book cover (his business, <a href="http://lasersmakeitawesome.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lasers Make It Awesome</a>, is featured in the book).</p>
<img src="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48014077092_ded328820b_k-700x467.jpg" alt="100-Side-Hustles-Tour-Laser-Engraved-Wood-Sign" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-41851" srcset="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48014077092_ded328820b_k-700x467.jpg 700w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48014077092_ded328820b_k-250x167.jpg 250w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48014077092_ded328820b_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/48014077092_ded328820b_k-120x80.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />
<p><strong>New York City</strong> was packed! Several of the events were standing room only, but this one had the highest overall attendance. </p>
<img src="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/100-Side-Hustles-Book-Tour-New-York-City-Tour-700x476.jpg" alt="100-Side-Hustles-Book-Tour-New-York-City-Tour" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-41852" srcset="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/100-Side-Hustles-Book-Tour-New-York-City-Tour-700x476.jpg 700w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/100-Side-Hustles-Book-Tour-New-York-City-Tour-250x170.jpg 250w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/100-Side-Hustles-Book-Tour-New-York-City-Tour-768x523.jpg 768w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2019/06/100-Side-Hustles-Book-Tour-New-York-City-Tour-120x82.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />
<p>The hometown crowd showed up well for my sixth event at Powell’s. </p>

<p>I’ve had a lot of fun talking with young side hustlers, including this guy who is thinking of starting a Spanish-language Fortnite channel on Twitch.  </p>

</h5>
</ul>
<p>This is my most popular book in five years, with more than 75,000 copies sold in the U.S. and a dozen foreign translations published so far.</p>
<h5>Here’s how my publisher describes it:</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;The author of the New York Times Bestseller THE $100 STARTUP, shows how to launch a profitable side hustle in just 27 days.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To some, the idea of quitting their day job to start a business is exhilarating. For others, it’s terrifying. After all, a job that produces a steady paycheck can be difficult to give up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But in a time when businesses have so little loyalty to employees that the very notion of “job security” has become a punchline, wouldn’t it be great to have an additional source of income to fall back on? And wouldn’t it be great to make that happen without leaving your day job?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Enter the Side Hustle. Based on detailed information from hundreds of case studies, Chris Guillebeau provides a step-by-step guide that anyone can use to create and launch a profitable project in less than a month. Designed for the busy and impatient, this plan will have you generating income immediately, without the risk of throwing yourself head first into the world of entrepreneurship.  </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Whether you just want to make some extra money, or start something that may end up replacing your day job entirely, the side hustle is the new job security. When you generate income from multiple sources, it gives you options, and in today’s world, options aren&#8217;t just nice to have: they&#8217;re essential. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You don’t need entrepreneurial experience to launch a profitable side hustle. You don’t need a business degree, know how to code, or be an expert marketer. And you certainly don’t need employees or investors. With this book as your guide, anyone can learn to build a fast track to freedom.</p>
<img src="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2017/01/Chris-chris-chris.jpg" alt="" />
<p>In 2018 I went on a tour to meet readers in 30 cities and talk about the book. It was a wonderful experience and I’d love to do it again&#8230; but until that’s possible, now you can get the book for just $1.99. At that price, you may want to add it to your digital library even if you have the printed version.</p>
<h5>Link: <a href="https://aonc.co/sidepromo" target="_blank">Get SIDE HUSTLE for $1.99</a> </h5>
<p></em><em>Note to international readers: because of how the publishing world works, this promotion is intended for readers in the U.S. and Canada (sorry). In some cases you <strong>may</strong> be able to purchase from the U.S. version of Amazon or another site, depending on how your settings are configured. </em></p>

<p>For much of the next week I&#8217;ll be working only half-time while I consider some of my successes, failures, and lessons learned from 2018. </p>
<h2><strong>But Wait, You Can Do This Too!</strong></h2>
<p>My favorite part about the review is that it brings a degree of order to my multi-faceted life and career, which consists of many different projects and roles. My <em>second</em> favorite part is seeing what everyone else comes up with. </p>
<p>Over the years, many of our readers have conducted their own Annual Reviews, frequently sharing their lessons with others on blogs, social media, or just with friends and families. A whole cottage industry of other review outlines, resources, and manifestos has sprung up, which is great to see.</p>
<p>Here’s my approach:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review">Read the original post</a></p>
<p>2. <a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/11/annualreviewtemplate2018.xls">Download this free tool</a> (more about this in a moment)</p>
<p>3. Before doing anything else, make two lists consisting of <strong>a) what went well</strong> and <strong>b) what <em>didn’t</em> go well this year</strong></p>
<p>4. You can skip ahead to the <strong>goal-setting part of the review</strong> if you want—but it&#8217;s also good to space it out a little. That&#8217;s why I do mine over the course of about four or five days, working on it a couple hours each day</p>
<h2><strong>Revised Spreadsheet Template (Download for Free)</strong></h2>
<p>For the whole <strike>eight</strike> <strike>nine</strike> <strong>ten!</strong> years I’ve used the same simple spreadsheet to set goals in various life categories. It’s a very basic tool. It won’t win any design awards, but it will help you to think more clearly about your life, which is probably more important.</p>
<p>We’ve recently tweaked the formatting and added a few more data points, so be sure you have the current version:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/11/annualreviewtemplate2018-1.xls">—>Download the Updated Annual Review Template</a></p>
<p>You might wonder whether a spreadsheet is sufficient to truly devise what matters to you and plan your life accordingly. This is a valid concern—we first need to ensure that our goals match up with our values and overall vision. </p>
<p>No amount of goal-setting will help if you’re pursuing the wrong goals. However, I do believe (strongly!) that being specific about our intentions and tying them to measurable milestones is good for us.</p>
<p>If you haven’t done it before, give it a try. And if the template structure doesn’t work for you, don’t hesitate to modify it however it serves you best.</p>
<p><strong>Onwards!</strong></p>

A lot of people have asked how to watch the talks that our main stage keynotes have given. Since year one, we’ve had a bunch of them online… but never before on YouTube!<p></p>

Well, guess what: now whenever you’re watching cat videos or teenage makeup videos, you can also check out keynotes from some of our most popular speakers.<p></p>

It’s one of the few things I’ve made that holds up over time. Every year we all end the weekend feeling exhausted, yet grateful.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I've had a few people write in to ask me if I've stopped blogging. Nope—but I'm sorry! It sure looks that way. <p></p>

I've just been on hiatus while writing a new book. I'll tell you about it soon, and I very much look forward to getting back to regular posts here. (In the meantime, the <a href="http://sidehustleschool.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily podcast</a> continues.)<p></p>

For now, I thought I'd pop up and express something that's been on my mind. Every now and then, I see a post offering "Advice for My Younger Self," and I've been asked to share mine in interviews from time to time. <p></p>

The question I've learned to ask, when working through various issues, is, <strong>"What is six-year-old Chris feeling right now?"</strong> It's an interesting practice, at least to someone like me who doesn't naturally think this way. <p></p>

<em>If I could go back in time to talk to a younger Chris, though, I'm not sure it would be the six-year-old version. I think it would be a version somewhere in the 11-14 age range. </em>]]></description>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a few people write in to ask me if I&#8217;ve stopped blogging. Nope—but I&#8217;m sorry! It sure looks that way. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just been on hiatus while writing a new book. I&#8217;ll tell you about it soon, and I very much look forward to getting back to regular posts here. (In the meantime, the <a href="http://sidehustleschool.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily podcast</a> continues.)</p>
<p>For now, I thought I&#8217;d pop up and express something that&#8217;s been on my mind. Every now and then, I see a post offering &#8220;Advice for My Younger Self,&#8221; and I&#8217;ve been asked to share mine in interviews from time to time. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been going to therapy for more than two years now, and one of the models I&#8217;ve explored is the concept of a younger version of ourselves remaining part of us as we age. This younger self needs to be cared for, since it&#8217;s not able to do so on its own, and it can influence our adult decisions in all sorts of ways. </p>
<p>The question I&#8217;ve learned to ask, when working through various issues, is, <strong>&#8220;What is six-year-old Chris feeling right now?&#8221;</strong> It&#8217;s an interesting practice, at least to someone like me who doesn&#8217;t naturally think this way. </p>
<p><em>If I could go back in time to talk to a younger Chris, though, I&#8217;m not sure it would be the six-year-old version. I think it would be a version somewhere in the 11-14 age range. </em></p>
<p>And I think I would say just three things, besides &#8220;Put all your money in this thing called Bitcoin whenever it comes out.&#8221; </p>
<p>Those things would be: </p>
<h4><strong>1. It&#8217;s going to be okay. </strong></h4>
<p>This is hard to believe right now, but it&#8217;s true.  </p>
<p>You&#8217;re very afraid much of the time now. You don&#8217;t like yourself and don&#8217;t see an end to what seems like impossible situations. <strong>Guess what: there will be an end to those situations.</strong> And one day you&#8217;ll be proud of getting through them. If you believe nothing else, believe this. </p>
<p>Hold on for one more day, just like you hear in the Wilson Phillips song that is currently playing on the radio all the time.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Don&#8217;t allow your rebellious spirit to be broken. </strong></h4>
<p>It&#8217;s there for a reason and will serve you well for decades to come. Sure, there might be times when &#8220;reining it in&#8221; is the better option. But there will be <em>many other times</em> when your inclination to look for alternatives, pursue a different path, or even just cause trouble will end up being the far better choice. </p>
<p>Therefore, when in doubt—think and act for yourself. Don&#8217;t be afraid to push against rules that don&#8217;t make sense or institutions that exist merely to enrich themselves. If anything, push <em>harder</em>.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Don&#8217;t worry about the things you aren&#8217;t good at.</strong> </h4>
<p><a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/cant-learn-math/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You&#8217;ll never learn math</a>, and it will be fine. You&#8217;ll never acquire many mechanical skills, and it won&#8217;t matter. </p>
<p>In fact, the more you try to improve at things you have no interest in <em>but think you are supposed to be good at</em>, the more frustrated you will become. <strong>Striving to become unremarkably average will get you nowhere you want to go. </strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, what <em>will</em> matter is that you hold fast to what you believe in, make it through the difficult times, and find your own way.</p>
<p>If you focus on the gifting you have, your ability to persevere, and the &#8220;don&#8217;t ever count him out&#8221; quality that you cultivate and cherish, you&#8217;ll become much stronger. This will be your north star. Follow it whenever you get off course.  </p>
<p>Oh, and here&#8217;s some bonus advice, for twelve-year-old Chris and anyone else out there who identifies with him: <strong>try to worry less about what other people think of you</strong>. You&#8217;ll be much more successful, effective, and happier when you don&#8217;t. </p>

Way back in 2011, 400 adventurers gathered in Portland, Oregon to consider an important question, <em>"How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?". </em>Embracing the core values of Community, Adventure, and Service, the event was called the <strong>World Domination Summit.</strong><p></p>

8 years later, our once "little" community has grown to <strong>over 10,000 adventurers representing all 50 states and over 40+ countries</strong>. <p></p>

We've broken world records, learned to Bollywood dance, faced our fears, found true connection, challenged conventionality, and supported each other's dreams. <p></p>

At this year's gathering, we made an important announcement that we'll produce <strong>two more years of our epic annual gathering.</strong> Next year is WDS 2019, and then <strong>WDS 2020 will be our 10-year grand finale!</strong>]]></description>

<p>Way back in 2011, 400 adventurers gathered in Portland, Oregon to consider an important question, <em>&#8220;How do we live a remarkable life in a conventional world?&#8221;. </em>Embracing the core values of Community, Adventure, and Service, the event was called the <strong>World Domination Summit.</strong></p>
<p>8 years later, our once &#8220;little&#8221; community has grown to <strong>over 10,000 adventurers representing all 50 states and over 40+ countries</strong>. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve broken world records, learned to Bollywood dance, faced our fears, found true connection, challenged conventionality, and supported each other&#8217;s dreams. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never been to a WDS before, check out this short recap video from this year&#8217;s events:</p>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/280404514" width="720" height="440" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>At this year&#8217;s gathering, we made an important announcement that we&#8217;ll produce <strong>two more years of our epic annual gathering.</strong> Next year is WDS 2019, and then <strong>WDS 2020 will be our 10-year grand finale!</strong></p>
<p>Naturally, not everyone was in attendance at this year&#8217;s event—so I wanted to explain a bit more about this decision.</p>
<p>First, for those of you who missed the announcement or just want to see it again, watch this 7-minute video (below):</p>

<p>Second, here are some answers to questions i&#8217;ve been asked recently:</p>
<p><strong>Why is WDS ending?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing lasts forever. When we started WDS, there wasn&#8217;t anything like it. Almost every other conference or event was overrun with sponsor logos. Speakers pitched their products from the stage. Swag bags contained junk items that most attendees immediately discarded.</p>
<p>We wanted to make something different, and we succeeded. Now, there are numerous conferences and events that contain elements of the WDS &#8220;DNA&#8221; in different forms.</p>
<p>Also, we want to end on a peak, not just go on forever. We want to celebrate what we&#8217;ve made and look forward to something new.</p>
<p><strong>Why announce the end two years early?</strong></p>
<p>Some people just come to WDS because it&#8217;s a fun experience, or to network, and that&#8217;s fine. But for others (including many of our team and ambassadors), this gathering has become very special.</p>
<p>Rather than just say &#8220;It&#8217;s over,&#8221; we wanted people to be able to prepare for the end, and also to join us in finishing well.</p>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41550" src="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/08/WDS-2018-opening-party.jpg" alt="WDS-2018-opening-party" srcset="https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/08/WDS-2018-opening-party.jpg 1000w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/08/WDS-2018-opening-party-250x167.jpg 250w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/08/WDS-2018-opening-party-768x512.jpg 768w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/08/WDS-2018-opening-party-700x467.jpg 700w, https://chrisguillebeau.com/files/2018/08/WDS-2018-opening-party-120x80.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />
<p><strong>Is WDS being sold?</strong></p>
<p>Nope. It&#8217;s not being sold and it&#8217;s not for sale. For our final two years, we&#8217;ll continue to operate on the same model we&#8217;ve had from the beginning: all profits go to the WDS Foundation, a 501(c)(3). The Foundation will then continue to operate until all its distributions have been made.</p>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure! Two years is a long time. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> There&#8217;s no secret plan and we want to focus on putting together a fantastic experience for 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p><strong>How can I get involved with the final two years?</strong></p>
<p>If WDS has meant something to you in the past, <em>please plan to return at least one of the years</em>. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been waiting for the right time to attend WDS, <em>now is the time. </em>Everyone that attends WDS has a major role in creating the experience for that year.<em>  </em>In other words&#8230; <em>we need you!</em></p>

<p>WDS was never just about an event. It has been and will forever be about community. It&#8217;s been an unforgettable story so far—and I truly believe the best is yet to come.</p>
<p>I look forward to celebrating with you in 2019, 2020, and beyond.</p>
