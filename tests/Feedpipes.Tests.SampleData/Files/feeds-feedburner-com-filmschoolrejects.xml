				<description>&lt;p&gt;It's less about the cars every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/hobbs-and-shaw-review/"&gt;&amp;#8216;Hobbs and Shaw&amp;#8217; Review: Delivers What It Promises and Nothing More&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise is a tedious film series that found life in its later years. In 2001, it sold itself as nothing more than a hot, schlocky piece of garbage high on speed and glitzy, early aughts conceptions of cool. It’s morphed over the years into an explosive, medium-sized cinemaction universe complete with heists, cyber-genetics, intelligence agencies, and unseen mastermind villains. Now, 18 years later, the franchise has checked a new box by releasing its first spinoff &#8212; minus any significant characters featured in the first four films (sorry, Dom) &#8212; focused on rogue good cop, Luke Hobbs (<strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong>), and nemesis Deckard Shaw (<strong>Jason Statham</strong>), a cruel villain turned bad boy protagonist.</p>
<p>For those that don’t know, Hobbs has a habit of putting Shaw in prison whle Shaw’s habit is to find reasons for Hobbs to put him there. They also fit perfectly into the <em>Fast and Furious</em> franchise because they care about family more than anything (Hobbs delivers a &#8220;family&#8221; speech here within the first 12 minutes). They’ve had to work together in the past, but it was always a twisty and begrudging effort. In that regard, not much has changed. Shaw is still slicing sports cars through narrow openings beneath moving eighteen-wheelers. Hobbs is still doing insane things like corralling a helicopter connected to a chain he’s holding with one hand. And both still hate each other.</p>
<p>The film opens with an MI6 mission gone wrong. Hattie’s (<strong>Vanessa Kirby</strong>) team is swiftly eliminated after genetically engineered super-villain Brixton (<strong>Idris Elba</strong>) and his squad unexpectedly arrive on the scene to steal a virus the team is trying to secure. If unleashed on the public, the virus will wipe out a large portion of humanity. It isn’t designed to dismantle society; rather, to make the human population stronger by eliminating the weak. In other words, it’s a self-enacting viral genocide. Unwilling to risk it falling into Brixton’s hands, Hattie injects herself with the virus and escapes only to discover that she’s been framed for murdering the whole team. Cut to the boys.</p>
<p>The first sequence with the titular characters is a split screen showcase of their morning routines, Hobbs in L.A. and Shaw in London. Hobbs is surrounded by sunshine and palm trees, Shaw showered in rain and fog. The two screens illuminate some lighthearted similarities and differences. For example, the bit eventually develops into parallel showdowns in which each one handily kicks small-time-crime-lord ass without breaking a sweat or sacrificing a one-liner. They both deliver critical hits straight to the balls of their victims, but before they do, one self-identifies as a “can of whoop ass” and the other a (significantly less intimidating) “champagne problem.”</p>
<p>Hobbs is then met by an old CIA buddy (whose identity I’ll let you find out for yourself) and Shaw’s met by a prototypical black-cloaked agent of sorts. We learn that Hattie is Shaw’s little sister, and we know how he (and everyone else in the franchise) feels about family. With Hobbs under the impression that Hattie is a bloodthirsty loose cannon in possession of the virus and Shaw determined to save his sister from death by virus, they individually commit to do whatever they can to find her &#8212; whatever they can that doesn’t involve each other, of course.</p>
<p>As soon as they realize they’ve been intentionally teamed up, they’re furious, refusing to work with one another. The initial confrontation shapes the tone of the following two hours &#8212; violent, high-octane slapstick built on ungiven fucks and brawny brawls worthy of <em>They Live</em>’s iconic alley scene. They troll each other every chance they get, brandishing their childishness by giving each other fake identities like “Mike Oxmaul” and “Hugh Janus.” The duo bickers and flings testosterone around as freely as chimpanzees fling feces. Director <strong>David Leitch</strong> shows self-awareness by utilizing the alpha male embattlements to comedic effect, but it’s so overt it develops a redundancy complex at times.</p>
<p>The abrasive, insulting mono-e-monos are genuinely funny every once in a while &#8212; often when they’re in troll mode &#8212; but it’s hit and miss. When a few in a row don’t land, it feels like someone put a subpar Drake diss track on repeat. And the number of times someone in the film references Hobbs and Shaw’s clipping masculinity or inability to look past differences for the common good is nauseating. It’s a joke that only garners a faint laugh the first time, so recycling it in ten-minute intervals is just sluggish screenwriting, which, ultimately, is the name of the game for <em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</em>.</p>
<p>In the first few minutes, Brixton, a.k.a. “Black Superman,” literally says “I’m the bad guy” when asked who he is. That’s not clever. That’s lazy, shameless, curdled material from screenwriters <strong>Chris Morgan</strong> and <strong>Drew Pearce</strong>. Other stuffed-crust lines like, “In life, things happen. You may not want them to, but they do,” and “I’ve been running my whole life” warrant eye rolls long enough to miss the rest of the film, but they’re delivered with the apparent intention of stirring up real, human emotion. Frankly, it’s insulting. But, who am I kidding? No one is going to see <em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw </em>to glean wisdom. Still, a better version would’ve strayed away from the abhorrent philosophizing.</p>
<p>Back to the plot, Hobbs and Shaw quickly find Hattie, and the three—Hattie as kickass as the other two—fly all over the world to find the antidote to the virus coursing through her veins and stop Brixton. In the meantime, we learn more about Brixton and Eteon, the supreme evil that guides him: a progress-driven think tank mercenary tech conglomerate that owns the media, experiments with biotech weaponry, and supports eugenics. Yes, it’s a bit on the nose. Brixton is one of these experiments, his body technologically resurrected and advanced by Eteon after Shaw put a bullet in his brain years ago. We never meet the mastermind behind Eteon because he’s merely a distorted voice that surrounds his underlings. But the series suggests we might meet him in the future.</p>
<p>The choice to characterize Eteon as a militant, media-controlling tech giant is relevant and fine, but <em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw </em>doesn’t have the wherewithal to deal with the implications of such a conglomerate. It never reaches past the face value comparison of industry versus humanity, despite feigning dialogue that thinks it does. As mentioned earlier, a movie like this exists for the explosions, body count, general excessive action, belittling buddy cop routine, and sexy sweat. Audiences know that as well as the filmmakers do. That’s why it’s frustrating when the movie tries to address nuanced issues it doesn’t have the language or creative agency to do justice.</p>
<p><em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw </em>is simply what it is, and that is an action blockbuster. It feels like a modern version of <em>48 Hrs.</em>, infused with <em>Transporter </em>franchise ventures and <em>Untitled Big Budget Dwayne Johnson Adventure Movie</em> playfulness (think: <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em>, <em>Walking Tall</em>, <em>San Andreas</em>, etc.). Anyone jonesing for girthy biceps, hardheaded conflict, satirical masculinity, lovable cameos, occasional laughs, guns losing to fists, and a taste of the <em>Fast and Furious</em> universe, is going to love it. Everyone else will just be happy to revel in the catharsis of celebrities mocking <em>Game of Thrones </em>season 8 on the big screen for the first time.</p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;The Daywalker is coming to the MCU, and we’ve got the essential comics you need to devour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/blade-reading-list/"&gt;The &amp;#8216;Blade&amp;#8217; Reading List&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Better put those ice skates away, <strong>Blade</strong> is back. Probably the last Marvel superhero we expected to be announced at this year&#8217;s San Diego Comic-Con, the Daywalker brought the house down in a big way thanks to the Academy Award-winning actor attached to the role. To hear Marvel Studios head <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/kevin-feige-wanted-mahershala-ali-for-blade-before-he-e-1836576209"><strong>Kevin Feige</strong> tell it</a>, without the interest of <strong>Mahershala Ali</strong>, the chances of <em>Blade</em>&#8216;s resurrection were pretty slim. Hell, the original vampire slayer, Wesley Snipes, was still holding out hope that he&#8217;d get another crack at the bat &#8212; or stake as the case may be.</p>
<p>A lot of credit gets thrown to the first adaptation from 1998. As our own Kieran Fisher states in his <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/superhero-horror-movies/3/">guide to superhero horror movies</a>, &#8220;Until <em>Blade</em> came around, comic book movies were stuck in a rut.&#8221; From its success stems 20th Century Fox&#8217;s foray into the <em>X-Men</em> universe and Sony&#8217;s swing at <em>Spider-Man</em>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>The effect of removing <em>Blade</em> from the timeline is debatable. What&#8217;s not debatable is the massive alteration a character like Frank Brooks (a.k.a. Frank Blade) will have once inserted into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As <em>Thor</em> eased audiences into the more fantastical elements of Marvel comics in 2011 and <em>Doctor Strange</em> introduced magical terrors in 2016, <em>Blade</em> will smash down the supernatural door barely left hanging by the hinges after Scott Derickson <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/mcu-multiverse-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hopefully swings it wide</a> in his 2021 sequel<em> Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.</em> Vampires, werewolves, demons, oh my.</p>
<p>Blade first appeared as an antagonist to Bram Stoker&#8217;s infamous bloodsucker in <em>Tomb of Dracula </em>#10. Written by Marv Wolfman and penciled by Gene Colan, the character was a stereotypical blaxploitation avenger that quickly overtook the rest of the book. Wolfman was so concerned by the larger-than-life personality that he pressed pause on his narrative, removing Blade from the title for almost a year. When Blade returned, his dialogue was a little less problematic (uhhhhh &#8212; still not great) but a lot duller. Many writers would have their hand at Blade, dropping him into comics like <em>Adventures into Fear</em>, <em>Ghost Rider</em>, and <em>Morbius</em>. He failed to exhilarate.</p>
<p>The truth is that you have to give most of Blade&#8217;s respectability to Snipes. After 1998, Marvel Comics had a financially successful model to follow, and the Daywalker began to resonate on a deeper level alongside the usual superhero suspects. We need to ask the man himself, but I&#8217;m guessing that whatever fandom Ali has formed around the character has its roots in Snipes&#8217; portrayal. As such, if you&#8217;re looking to study up on Blade, the best comics to launch your odyssey were published in the last 20 years. For those still interested in the character&#8217;s origins, I would recommend experimenting with the compilation<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blade-Black-White-Chris-Claremont/dp/0785114696"><strong><em> Blade: Black and White</em></strong></a>. Inside you&#8217;ll discover a smattering of Blade&#8217;s early appearances and few curious excitements like <em>Blade: Crescent City Blues </em>#1 and <em>Marvel Shadows and Light </em>#1.</p>
<h3>5. Blade MAX Vol. 2 (2004)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342960" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-MAX-2.jpg" alt="Blade Max" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-MAX-2.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-MAX-2-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-MAX-2-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This mature content (blood, sex, swears) collection of comics is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blade-MAX-Issues-Complete-Mini/dp/B0757BFWFK/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=blade+max&amp;qid=1564542604&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-6">a little tricky to track down</a> but well worth doing so if you have the money and the time. Writer <strong>Christopher Hinz</strong> and artist <strong>Steve Pugh</strong> basically do their take on Guillermo del Toro&#8217;s <em><strong>Blade 2</strong></em> with the Daywalker taking on other vampire-killing vampires that are more mutant than simple creatures of the night. The real appeal is Hinz&#8217;s ability to transfer Snipes&#8217; cool stillness to the page and deliver a threat fitting of the superhero confines. After all, vampire slayers practically grow on trees these days, so the Marvel variety needs to up its game from the usual literary or Universal Monster threats. Comic book vampires gotta offer more than fangs and bat wings.</p>
<h3>4. Blade: Undead Again (2007)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342961" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-Doctor-Doom.jpg" alt="Blade Doctor Doom" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-Doctor-Doom.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-Doctor-Doom-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blade-Doctor-Doom-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Ok, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blade-Vol-Undead-Marvel-Comics/dp/0785123644">this one is a little nuts</a>, but hear me out. The Daywalker is a Marvel Comics Superhero. That means he needs to interact with other Marvel Comics Superheroes, battling the big threats back-to-back with The Avengers. Published a few years after the Max line of comics reached their end, <em>Blade: Undead Again</em> pits Blade against Doctor Doom, Spider-Man, Dracula, Wolverine, and a shopping mall Santa Clause. I probably lost you on that last one, but I&#8217;m asking you to trust me. Artists <strong>Howard Chaykin</strong> and <strong>Marc Guggenheim</strong> run Blade through a gauntlet of characters and it is as compelling as it is silly. On top of all that, this quick miniseries found new ways to expand on the Daywalker&#8217;s beginnings, introducing Blade&#8217;s complicated and self-involved father.</p>
<h3>3. Captain Britain and MI13: Vampire State (2009)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342962" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Captain-Britain-Blade-2.jpg" alt="Captain Britain Blade" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Captain-Britain-Blade-2.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Captain-Britain-Blade-2-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Captain-Britain-Blade-2-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>In all seriousness, the nifty thing about Blade coming to the MCU is to witness him clash against our most beloved characters. Stuck in his corner of the franchise, Blade is not that interesting. Battling vampire hordes next to spandex-clad European badasses like Captain Britain and The Black Knight is our jam. When the British government runs afoul of Dracula, there is only one ally to call. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Captain-Britain-Mi13-Vampire-State/dp/1846534399/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=captain+Britain+vampire+state&amp;qid=1564545579&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">Blade + Excalibur = hell, yeah</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Ultimate Comics Avengers: Blade vs. The Avengers (2011)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342964" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ultimate-Blade-2.jpg" alt="Ultimate Blade" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ultimate-Blade-2.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ultimate-Blade-2-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ultimate-Blade-2-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>From the violently demented brain that brought you <em>Wanted</em>, <em>Kick-Ass</em>, and <em>Kingsmen</em>. <strong>Mark Millar</strong>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Comics-Avengers-Blade-vs/dp/0785140964"><em>Ultimate Comics Avengers: Blade Vs. The Avengers</em> </a>technically takes place in an alternate reality from the other three storylines, but it&#8217;s always healthy to shake things up with a multiverse. Looking at Phase Four of the MCU, movie audiences are going to have to adjust to this concept quickly. When vampires begin transforming superhumans into their kind, S.H.I.E.L.D. reluctantly teams-up with the Daywalker. The situation escalates quickly, and the heroes nearly succumb to the bloodsuckers until Captain America gets&#8230;worthy. Yup. <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> has nothing on this patriotic sledgehammering climax.</p>
<h3>1. Doctor Strange: Damnation (2018)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342965" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Doctor-Strange-Damnation-2.jpg" alt="Doctor Strange Damnation" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Doctor-Strange-Damnation-2.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Doctor-Strange-Damnation-2-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Doctor-Strange-Damnation-2-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Strange-Damnation-Complete-Collection-ebook/dp/B07D51JS7F/ref=sr_1_1?tag=combooher05-20&amp;s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532358891&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Damnation+marvel">a comic book epic</a> that spans multiple supernatural Marvel titles including <em>Doctor Strange</em>, <em>Ghost Rider</em>, <em>Iron Fist</em>, and <em>Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider</em>. All hell breaks loose after Stephen Strange attempts to magically aid the crumbling city of Las Vegas (see the controversial <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Empire-Nick-Spencer/dp/0785194525"><em>Secret Empire</em></a>). The demon Mephisto summons an army of Ghost Riders to wage war against the Sorcerer Supreme, and his BFF Wong is forced to call reinforcements. Answering the alarm is an eclectic band of B- and C-list characters including Blade. While our favorite hero is somewhat second fiddle in this book, the moments he gets shine viciously. We&#8217;ve seen the Daywalker take on numerous vampires in the past, but for the character to properly settle into the MCU he needs to prove his worth against the cosmic threats. Blade is more than a vampire slayer. He can kick a demon&#8217;s ass just as well. He does plenty in <em>Damnation</em>.</p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Nolan's sci-fi extravaganza is certainly ambitious in visual and narrative scope. However, the cathartic simplicity that resides at the film's heart is the real scene-stealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/inception/"&gt;&amp;#8216;Inception&amp;#8217; and the Therapeutic Nature of Dreams&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Christopher Nolan</strong> has long demonstrated a keenness towards cracking the code of cinema. Each of his movies employs exciting narrative constructs for maximum audience immersion and engagement. For instance, this may occur through the use of non-linear storytelling, or via wider, more complex themes that touch the realm of science fiction.</p>
<p>However, what makes Nolan’s work so unique to experience is the fact that his outwardly convoluted ideas seamlessly blend with more elementary, emotion-based narrative throughlines. Nolan’s films are a delicate balance of simplicity and artful imagination, often morphing precise cinematic technique into something far more heartfelt and memorable.</p>
<p>Take Nolan’s 2010 sci-fi epic <em><strong>Inception</strong></em> as a prime example of this. On one hand, the film boasts an undeniable technical prowess, reveling in its portrayal of the limitless visual grandeur of lucid dreams. Yet on the other, the movie&#8217;s massive dreamscapes are populated with empathetic characters who are on a very personal, cathartic quest of self-discovery.</p>
<p>This particular marriage of emotion and craft wasn’t always on Nolan’s mind. The filmmaker initially wrote a treatment that lacked a vital sense of depth, which contributed to the shelving of the project for a number of years. <em>Inception</em> was originally conceived as a glossy heist film, which, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-apr-04-la-ca-inception4-2010apr04-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per Nolan’s own words</a>, “traditionally are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms.”</p>
<p>Luckily, the director eventually found lasting relatable acuity in his early script. Notably, he largely credits <em>Inception</em>’s toplining actor, <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>, for such an epiphany. DiCaprio evidently insisted on honing in on<em> Inception</em>&#8216;s character-driven moments. Pure emotional motive became part and parcel of the film as a whole. As Nolan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100327204348/http://www.collider.com/2010/03/25/director-christopher-nolan-and-producer-emma-thomas-interview-inception-they-talk-3d-what-kind-of-cameras-they-used-pre-viz-wb-and-a-lot-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained to Collider</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[After DiCaprio boarded the film] I finally found that emotional connection with the material that I depend on as a filmmaker, because what I’ve realized about myself over the years is if I don’t engage with something on that level, I’ll never sustain my interest in it for the two years it takes to make it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Inception </em>wastes no time in establishing its protagonist’s personal drive, even if these pieces take time to fall into place. The movie opens on DiCaprio foggily waking up on the shoreline of a nondescript beach. Waves crash loudly – overwhelmingly – around him. Almost immediately, he is preoccupied with the sight of two children building sandcastles nearby. Their backs are turned to him. Despite the character&#8217;s visible exhaustion, he fervently clings to this image.</p>
<p>DiCaprio is soon revealed to be playing Dom Cobb, a man who is greatly skilled in the art of corporate espionage. Utilizing experimental military-grade technology, he is able to tap into his subjects’ subconscious via a shared dream world. After which, Cobb &#8220;extracts&#8221; sensitive information from certain targets at the behest of specific clients.</p>
<p>This is a very detail-oriented con job. Particular rules of time guide the constraints of extraction; five minutes of dream time equates to an hour in the real world. In a typical dream-sharing experience, death is generally enough of a &#8220;kick&#8221; to wake one up and bring them back to reality.</p>
<p>Importantly, agents specializing in architecture are responsible for constructing believable settings for each target; one that subliminal projections can inhabit without raising any red flags. Rich, complex mazes make for ideal locations, as they aptly disguise the boundaries of any given dream world.</p>
<p>Finally, the success of any extraction job largely requires a great deal of personal detachment and objectivity on the part of extractors’ themselves. Constructing a dream world from distinct places rooted in memory is frowned upon for this reason. Extractors must be cognizant of what’s real and what isn’t, too. They keep track of this fact through the use of personalized totems.</p>
<p>Alongside all that exposition, <em>Inception</em> eventually divulges that it is still virtually impossible to truly separate the deeply intuitive nature of dreams from the physical minutiae required to formulate and control them. This is especially so in the eponymous case of inception &#8212; the act of planting an organic concept into a target&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>That is exactly what Japanese tycoon Saito (<strong>Ken Watanabe</strong>) hires Cobb and his associate, Arthur (<strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong>), for. Specifically, Saito wishes to inject an idea – one that is “like a virus; resilient; [and] highly contagious” – into the heart of a rival business to precipitate its collapse.</p>
<p>Arthur immediately proclaims that this is an unattainable request. As he states, “true inspiration’s impossible to fake.” However, Cobb appears more pliable than his partner and is finally convinced to complete the job once Saito hits an emotional nerve. The latter encourages Cobb to “take a leap of faith” anyway. After all, due to Saito&#8217;s presumed governmental and political connections, participating in the heist in question is the only way for Cobb to reunite with his estranged family.</p>
<p>As this series of events have played out so far, the audience is made aware of Cobb&#8217;s many personal setbacks which collectively hamper his effectiveness as an espionage agent. He is a wanted criminal barred from returning to the United States due to murder charges. This eats away at Cobb, who longs to return home to his young son and daughter. As a result, his children appear as projections of his own subconscious, often distracting him from the subject at hand whenever he&#8217;s perusing through a dreamscape.</p>
<p>They aren’t the only ones, though. Cobb’s deceased wife Mal (<strong>Marion Cotillard</strong>) has her own hold over his mind. She is the reason he is on the run, as authorities believe that he killed her. Cobb’s close connection to Mal’s death, in turn, causes her to materialize as a particularly disturbing and invasive projection; vindictive and violent enough to directly foil his plans time and time again. And the more he refuses to confront his unresolved feelings surrounding her demise, the more vicious she becomes.</p>
<p>Herein lies the concurrently therapeutic and creepy possibilities of <em>Inception</em>&#8216;s shared dream space. The film makes it abundantly clear that reveries are most believably born by attaching themselves to feeling, whether they be good or bad.</p>
<p>Saito’s proposed con is to incept his business competitor, Robert Fischer (<strong>Cillian Murphy</strong>), and convince him to tear down the empire he is soon to inherit from his ailing magnate father. The job requires careful construction and calibration of the dream space to create emotional anchors that did not previously exist in Fischer&#8217;s subconscious.</p>
<p>This is largely achieved by turning Saito’s broad pitch into a powerful “emotional concept.” According to Eames (<strong>Tom Hardy</strong>) &#8212; another member of Cobb&#8217;s team &#8212; inception isn’t just about infiltrating the deepest levels of a target’s mind. Rather, “the simplest version of the idea” must be allowed to naturally germinate there as well. Only then will it grow to define a subject’s motivations and have a big enough influence on their organic decision-making.</p>
<p>Cobb then adds that, if possible, inceptors ought to approach their subjects from an optimistic standpoint when planting any impression:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation. For catharsis.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For a couple of reasons, the quote above is a perfect distillation of <em>Inception</em>’s overall thesis statement. Firstly, it succinctly determines how Cobb’s crew can succeed with Fischer, flipping the script of the strained relationship between him and his father and linking the dissolution of his inheritance with an independent, positive drive.</p>
<p>In spite of this, there’s a foreboding layer to Cobb’s observation, as well, circling back to the emotional limbo that continuously plagues the character from the get-go. As <em>Inception</em>&#8216;s persistently haunted protagonist, we&#8217;re encouraged to ask: why exactly is <em>he</em> chasing absolution?</p>
<p>This question is slowly answered throughout the course of the film by the highly perceptive architect Ariadne (<strong>Ellen Page</strong>). Although a fresh-faced member of Cobb’s crew, she picks up on his furtive behavior practically immediately. Furthermore, having personally encountered Mal during shared dreaming exercises in the lead-up to their big heist, Ariadne is wary of the possible danger she poses to the upcoming job. On more than one occasion, she confronts Cobb about such secrets, demanding that he be honest with the rest of the group to protect their safety.</p>
<p>Cobb&#8217;s truth encompasses the bombshell revelation of <em>Inception</em>. His mounting guilt over the circumstance surrounding his wife&#8217;s death ultimately highlights the dangerous nature of dream manipulation. Fischer&#8217;s case demonstrates that the potential to heal flawed relationships exists in dream-sharing. Sadly, Cobb has also used it in more manipulative ways.</p>
<p>His actions were borne out of good intentions, yet they undoubtedly reaped a terrible outcome. Together with Mal, who was once a fellow dream-sharer, Cobb spent many years constructing a literal dream life. But after overindulging in the unbridled creative promises of the dreamscape for so long, Mal began to severely lose track of reality. When she refused to leave the state of dreaming and return to raise their family, Cobb chose to incept her with a nagging idea &#8212; namely, “your world is not real.&#8221;</p>
<p>His treachery inadvertently causes Mal to question all semblance of existence long after she had finally returned to the real world. Cobb&#8217;s unwitting decision to plant that insidious concept into Mal&#8217;s subconscious only leads her to believe that she must do everything she can to &#8220;wake up,&#8221; resulting in her suicide. Fascinatingly, while this fact paints Cobb in a considerably unsavory light, his admission certainly triggers the process of catharsis. Without the need to repress a shameful past any longer, the character now has a chance to defeat from the “shade of [his] real wife,&#8221; letting Mal go and kickstarting the beginning of a restorative process.</p>
<p>Hence, <em>Inception</em> manages to draw audiences to an unusually satisfying conclusion. The film’s main heist – complete with high-octane chase scenes, mind-bending fight sequences, and utterly thrillingly tense narrative beats – ensures that its ensemble barely has time to catch a breath. Nonetheless, the devil is in the details further still. The only true navigator guiding these characters through their near-impossible job is the power of emotion. The dreams of <em>Inception</em> allow characters to dig deep and explore themselves. Although this doesn&#8217;t necessarily free them of their responsibilities, the potential for reprieve is undeniably powerful.</p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Quentin Tarantino’s epic vengeance quest secures its thrills through righteous anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/django-unchained/"&gt;The Raging Heroism of ‘Django Unchained’&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world no longer needs your silence. Give us a scream or get the hell out of the way. With <strong><em>Inglourious Basterds</em></strong>, <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> satisfied six decades of moral aggravation when Adolf Hitler gathered a belly, chest, and face full of flaming hot lead. History and its acceptable cinematic approximations mattered not. The monster did not deserve to go out on his own terms; he didn&#8217;t deserve the reality he secured for himself. His end demanded a mutilation of flesh and bone to match generations of horror, anger, and disgust. Fuck that guy. Eat it, punk.</p>
<p>The older I get, the more I appreciate rage. The <em>Star Trek</em> kid within won&#8217;t let go of hope, but the journey to the Final Frontier can not possibly be achieved through sheer optimism. Peace can only be found at the end of a barrel. Samuel Colt understood that all the way back in 1855, and we&#8217;d be best to never forget it. Sideline election coverage grants disappointment. Hit the streets with the pamphlets and grab your billboards of protest. You&#8217;ll probably still lose, but you&#8217;ve stoked the fire for the next encounter. Keep the belly bubbling; sooner or later, your opponent will sleep.</p>
<p>While you could never claim Tarantino to be a mellow filmmaker, after <em>Basterds</em>, his narratives engorged through the healing properties of anger. <strong><em>Django Unchained</em></strong> plots an epic, recognizable hero&#8217;s journey to rescue the damsel from the wretched claws of Calvin Candie (<strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>) but gains giant grins from its audience equal to that of the climactic victor because the filmmaker understands our primal desire for hangman&#8217;s justice. The villain is clearly a villain; no need for courts, judges, or juries. We know what&#8217;s right. Django (<strong>Jamie Foxx</strong>) knows what&#8217;s right. Get it done.</p>
<p>Sir Lancelot and Luke Skywalker certainly relished their slaying of various henchman, and we cheered them on, but none of their killings feel as gratifying as when Django transforms Candyland cowboys into red clouds of obliterated meat while 2Pac&#8217;s &#8220;Untouchable&#8221; mashes against James Brown&#8217;s &#8220;The Payback.&#8221; Django and the walls disappear behind geysers of blood, and the crowd runs ravenous. Yes, yes, yes. Kill, kill, kill.</p>
<p>Tarantino bends many truths to achieve dramatic heights, but none when it came to the horrors and the business of Antebellum racism: the whip, the spiked collars, the cold arithmetic of balancing black and brown bodies. The European Dr. King Schultz (<strong>Christoph Waltz</strong>) removes Django from his chains and the trek they take to rescue Broomhilda (<strong>Kerry Washington</strong>) is a parade of human depravity. One in which any American who is not a descendant of slaves is culpable. We thrive on the flesh they gave, and the joy we take in Django&#8217;s vengeance is enriched by self-loathing. The outburst is all the reproachable can offer.</p>
<p>That rage is a healing power. Doctor Jeremy Dean, <a href="https://www.spring.org.uk/2012/03/the-upside-of-anger-6-psychological-benefits-of-getting-mad.php">the founder of PsyBlog</a>, makes a strong case for the beneficial properties of anger. He champions provocation as a motivating force; the steam required to elicit change on the intimate and global scale. He states, &#8220;Research has shown that anger can make us push towards our goals in the face of problems and barriers.&#8221; If a person gets mad enough, they cannot sit at the teat of the nightly news. They&#8217;ve read a history book or two, or more importantly, ridden alongside Django.</p>
<p>Fight or flight. It&#8217;s all in our evolution. When we&#8217;re backed against a wall, we bash against injustice through our anger. The heat propels us to be absolutely vigilant towards perilous opposing viewpoints. When we are attacked, the rage automatically activates and forces our hand before the brain has time to think. Speed is essential to survival, and furor gets us greased.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of<em> Django Unchained</em>&#8216;s entertainment rests in our hero&#8217;s triumphant smoke. With villains violently vanquished and Broomhilda safely astride a horse with fingers in her ears, Django lights his drag and straps on his sunglasses while Candyland explodes behind him. The fiery moment is as cathartic an act of physical destruction as the eradication of Hitler in <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>. Hindsight objectivity deems it so.</p>
<p>Anger allows for comfort. The sensation breeds emotional pain and can result in physical manifestations. Therefore, rage released means you can free up the tensions grinding down your teeth and twisting your muscles. When the steam spews from your ears, you&#8217;re free of the copious amounts of anxiety flooding your system. Your nerves need calming, and anger arrives to help.</p>
<p>The smile that Django and Broomhilda share is not an ordinary relief. Their threat is removed. A bright unknown crests on their horizon. They unite under the consolation that they enacted the necessary change demanded by the horrors around them. Doc Dean subscribes that the rageful are often the most optimistic individuals on the planet. Anger erases dread and &#8220;in contrast, those experiencing more fear were more pessimistic about the future and expected further attacks.&#8221; Problems will always arise, but Django can deal.</p>
<p>Tarantino is stewing with his cinema of late. He&#8217;s brought the rage to Nazis and racists, and in <strong><em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em></strong>, the director is hunting hippies. With wishful promises of a <em>Star Trek</em>, there is no denying Tarantino&#8217;s optimism, but I wouldn&#8217;t imagine a 10th (and possibly final) film to stray into the serene. If anything, the Tarantino fury of 2009, 2012, and 2019 was only warming up to true hellfire. We can take it.</p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Fans of Jim Henson, David Fincher, and Iko Uwais have a busy month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/new-on-netflix-august-2019/"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New to Stream on Netflix for August 2019, and What&amp;#8217;s Leaving&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people spend their days arguing over the merits of <strong>Netflix</strong>, but the rest of us are too busy enjoying new movies, engaging series, and fun specials. It’s just one more way to re-watch the movies we already love and find new ones to cherish, and this month sees some of both hitting the service.</p>
<p>The complete list of movies and shows hitting (and leaving) Netflix this month — August 2019 — is below, but first I’m going to highlight a few that stand apart from the bunch.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/red-dots.jpg" alt="Red Dots" width="60" height="17" /></p>
<h3>Netflix Pick of the Month</h3>
<p><iframe title="The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance | Teaser | Netflix" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSV42j8lccg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>1982&#8217;s <em>The Dark Crystal</em> <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/revisiting-jim-hensons-the-dark-crystal-to-see-if-it-s-worth-revisiting-bc76d09895a2/">remains a favorite</a> for many of us who saw it in theaters as kids, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have aged well with today&#8217;s viewers. It&#8217;s too dark, too slow, too whatever&#8230; but that&#8217;s a load of bullshit. To each their own, I guess, but for me the film retains its power and stands apart from today&#8217;s norm of excess CG and loud noises. A follow-up has long been rumored, and to be honest I feared it expecting a sequel to fall into the trap of modern-day kiddie fare (ie the CG and loudness mentioned above), but <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/dark-crystal-age-of-resistance-trailer/">the trailer</a> for <strong><em>The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</em></strong> [Netflix Original] looks to prove my concerns unfounded. Sure there are CG assists, but the bulk of the magic looks to be old-fashioned puppetry with all of our favorite characters and species returning. It looks gorgeous to boot,, so color me excited knowing that it hits Netflix starting August 30th.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/red-dots.jpg" alt="Red Dots" width="60" height="17" /></p>
<h3>Fun with David Fincher</h3>
<p><iframe title="MINDHUNTER | Trailer 2 | Netflix" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/evdxH50J3rs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been five years since David Fincher has gifted film fans with a new movie, and while that&#8217;s some straight-up bullshit we&#8217;ve at least had some television work to soften the wait. <strong><em>Mindhunter</em></strong> is a smart, wholly engrossing look into the creation of the FBI&#8217;s behavioral Science division in the 1970s &#8212; watch the trailer for season 1 above if you&#8217;re still on the fence &#8212; and while Fincher only directed some of the episodes his fingerprints are all over the series. Mindhunter&#8217;s second season arrives on the 16th with episodes once again directed by Fincher, Carl Franklin, and Andrew Dominik. Netflix even sweetens the pot this month by adding <strong><em>Panic Room</em></strong> on the 1st, and if you act fast, you should probably re-watch <strong><em>Zodiac</em></strong> before it leaves the service on 8/6.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/red-dots.jpg" alt="Red Dots" width="60" height="17" /></p>
<h3>Enjoy Once Upon a Time in&#8230; Hollywood? Watch This!</h3>
<p><iframe title="Jackie Brown | Official Trailer (HD) - Robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson | MIRAMAX" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlAECQzTkfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s 10th film is currently playing in theaters and is easily among his most entertaining and affectionate creations. I&#8217;m of the opinion that his best remains <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>, but many fans would make a case for <strong><em>Jackie Brown</em></strong> at the top of his filmography. I&#8217;m correct, obviously, but that doesn&#8217;t take away from this Pam Grier-led gem in the slightest. It hits town on the 1st, and it comes highly recommended.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/red-dots.jpg" alt="Red Dots" width="60" height="17" /></p>
<h3>Watch It Before It&#8217;s &#8220;Gone&#8221;</h3>
<p><iframe title="Beautiful Creatures (2013) Trailer - Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mmo4GzMMqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The complete list of movies and shows leaving Netflix this month is below, but allow me to point you towards a film you may have missed. <strong><em>Beautiful Creatures</em></strong> (2013) is disappearing from the service on 8/21, and I really can&#8217;t recommend enough that you give it a spin. It&#8217;s a rare YA adaptation that delivers in every way with character, wit, performances, production design, and a compelling narrative. The film unfortunately tanked at the box-office meaning we were cheated out of sequels, but it stands as a fantastically entertaining genre romance.</p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;The release of 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' means its is time to reflect on Quentin Tarantino's past work. I think 'The Hateful Eight' might be his best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-hateful-eight/"&gt;How &amp;#8216;The Hateful Eight&amp;#8217; Turns Limitation Into Brilliance&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really like </span><strong><i>The Hateful Eight</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Is it my favorite <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> film? No. Is it a masterpiece? Eh, maybe. Do I agree with your critique of it? Also maybe. But, I can’t get enough of it. I’m not sure why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite moment comes just after John “The Hangman” Ruth (<strong>Kurt Russell</strong>) and Daisy Domergue (<strong>Jennifer Jason Leigh</strong>) enter Minnie’s Haberdashery for the first (and last) time, leaving their stagecoach and the swiftly approaching blizzard behind. The shot keeps the handcuffed duo in the background, while General Sandford “Sandy” Smithers (<strong>Bruce Dern</strong>) and Oswaldo Mobray (<strong>Tim Roth</strong>) sit in armchairs by the fire in the foreground. As Ruth boards up the door behind them, sealing off the storm and their fate, Smithers glances directly into the camera, warning us of the trouble ahead.<a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dern-Looking-Gif-1.gif"><img class="alignright wp-image-342799 " src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dern-Looking-Gif-1.gif" alt="Dern Looking Gif" width="350" height="350" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is that fleeting glance that gets at the playful ethos of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the reason why I watch the film again and again. Roger Ebert began his review of </span><strong><i>Kill Bill: Vol. 1</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by writing, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The film] s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quentin Tarantino</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so effortlessly and brilliantly in command of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his technique that he reminds me of a virtuoso violinist racing through &#8216;Flight of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bumble Bee&#8217; &#8212; or maybe an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for &#8216;Lady of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spain.&#8217; I mean that as a sincere compliment. The movie is not about anything at all </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">except the skill and humor of its making. It&#8217;s kind of brilliant.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebert was right about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kill Bill, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and it is precisely this that I feel when I watch </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight &#8212; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that I am in the hands of a master. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a case study in the beauty of limitation, of a master challenging himself in form and style. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most obvious and notable example of this is the film’s use of a limited setting: Minnie’s Haberdashery. Tarantino has talked before about his desire to turn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight </span></i><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/the-hateful-eight-stage-play/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">into a stage play</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which one can easily imagine given that the film takes place mostly in a single room. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has always reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock’s </span><i>Dial ‘M’ for Murder</i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which I explore at length in my video essay “<a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/art-single-room-film/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Shoot a Film in One Room</a>.” Hitchcock once said that his decision to make the film came in part after seeing so many play adaptations that were not cinematic. These adaptations, mostly made for television, were dialogue-heavy dramas that were essentially filmed plays. The only changes made for the film versions, said Hitchcock, were adding moments where a character walks out of the taxi, onto the street, through the doorway, and into the room where the dramatic action takes place. With </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dial</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em> ‘M’</em>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his goal was to adapt a play using film language and challenge himself by limiting the film to mostly a single room. The same is done, minus the existence of source material, with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight. </span></i></p>
<p><iframe title="How to Shoot a Film in One Room" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/247527973?dnt=1&#038;app_id=122963" width="700" height="394" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the dramatic tension in the film is a byproduct of its limited setting. Shortly after we first enter Minnie’s, Tarantino explores the space in its entirety, giving us an opportunity to orient ourselves and actually see each nook and cranny. In doing so, Tarantino eliminates any prospect of using unseen space to create tension (at least until the big surprise), and instead must do so through the characters, their interplay, and, of course, the camera. The film becomes a murder mystery, but instead of taking place in a spooky castle or mansion that becomes its own character, Tarantino strips the setting of any mystique, leaving fewer tools to shock and surprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another one of the great joys of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is that its very existence defies the logic of its time. It is everything a 21st-century movie is told not to be: a single room, Western epic, with a “roadshow” version lasting more than three hours (not to mention the extended edition now on Netflix). As he is perhaps the most famous devotee of the Western genre alive, it is no surprise that Tarantino would make such a film, especially one that differs so much from his other Western, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Django Unchained</strong></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tarantino is also a man obsessed with sub-genres. He </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/05/the-movies-that-influenced-the-hateful-eight"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told IGN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time of the film’s release, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do like dealing in genres, but I also like dealing in sub-genres. So there are Westerns, and then there are Spaghetti Westerns. In this case, there’s also the sub, sub-genre of Snow Westerns. And Snow </span><span style="font-size: 15.9999px;">W</span><span style="font-size: 1.14285rem;">esterns &#8212; there’s not that many of them, but they’re there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are, of course, many ways to categorize a Western, but one of the distinctions that has most shaped my thinking of the genre is one made by the great Howard Hawks (one of Tarantino&#8217;s heroes), who said there are two types: those set before the establishment of law and order, and those set after. Hawks’ two great Westerns (both masterpieces) — </span><i>Red River </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1948) and </span><i>Rio Bravo </i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1959) — are perfect examples of this dichotomy. Whenever I watch a Western, I try to place the film I’m watching in one of these two categories. It is usually pretty easy, but with a film like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is a little more tricky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film begins as almost an homage to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stagecoach </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1939), one of John Ford’s best films and a quintessential example of the pre-law-and-order Western (this reference is ironic coming from Tarantino, a </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2012/12/quentin-tarantino-says-he-hates-john-ford-128649/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">known Ford hater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><iframe title="That Face | STAGECOACH and THE HATEFUL EIGHT Comparison" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/350027702?dnt=1&#038;app_id=122963" width="700" height="254" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the stagecoach makes its way to Minnie’s Haberdashery, the snow and landscape place us in the typical lawless, frontier Western. However, once the stagecoach gang enters the Haberdashery, law and order slowly begin to enter. Ruth’s decision to bring Daisy (who is wanted dead or alive) into the town of Red Rock to hang is a reminder that law and order have been established and prompts debates among the haberdashery’s patrons on the relative advantages and disadvantages of hanging her. When Major Warren (<strong>Samuel L. Jackson</strong>) kills the Confederate General Smithers in “self-defense” (Warren uses Smithers’s racism to provoke him into attacking), another legal debate ensues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnie’s Haberdashery, therefore, seems to be suspended between the two Western worlds Hawks identified. This limbo is only heightened by the presence of Chris Mannix (<strong>Walter Goggins</strong>), who has been elected to replace the murdered sheriff of Red Rock. Throughout the film, he tries to exercise his ambiguous authority as “Sheriff-elect,” like when he tells Ruth that leaving him behind in the blizzard would be equal to murdering the sheriff. Mannix’s undefined role and authority serve as a stand-in for the limbo of the film’s own genre. Plus, Minnie’s Haberdashery literally acts as a waypoint on the way to Red Rock, a bridge between law and order and the frontier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interior of the haberdashery too extenuates this feeling of a divided world. With candy, coffee, armchairs, and a roaring fire, Minnie’s seems like the perfect place to brave a blizzard. Call me naive, but I remember when I first watched the film, for a brief moment I thought that the haberdashery would merely be a stop on the way to the story’s main place of conflict — how could it be anything other than an oasis? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, we soon realize that it is just as much a part of the frontier as it is the world of law and order. We feel that because of all that I have previously mentioned: the single room and the formal and thematic tension it creates, and the limbo of the world itself. There is one more element (and presumably many others that I have not covered) that is essential to understanding the mastery of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the blizzard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all of Tarantino’s films, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">may have the best sound design. Yes, he abandoned popular music for an <strong>Ennio Morricone</strong> score, but I mean the sound of the natural elements, of the snowstorm constantly roaring in the background throughout the film.  In a </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/quentin-tarantino-ridley-scott-four-846682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood Reporter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> director&#8217;s roundtable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tarantino speaks of his commitment to the blizzard aesthetic, saying, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And one of the things that prepared me for that was watching a documentary about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apocalypse Now</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hearing [cinematographer Vittorio] Storaro talking about creating an aesthetic: &#8216;Once you do, you can&#8217;t go back.&#8217; I told that to the crew, I go: &#8216;We&#8217;re going to create this thing, and we can&#8217;t go backward. If that means it takes us three months to do this scene, because we have to match that snowfall, then that&#8217;s what we have to do.'&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it is that very commitment to consistency that makes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hateful Eight </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">such an achievement. I feel like I am </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these characters, that we are all surviving together in close quarters at Minnie’s Haberdashery on this one day, engulfed by the sound and feel of the blizzard. Are these characters particularly compelling? No. Do I care about them in the same way I do the characters in, say, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rio Bravo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? What an absurd question. But, I’m there with them. I love being with them, in their world, hanging out. Shit, maybe this thing is a masterpiece.</span></p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hunting down the wide-ranging influences of Tarantino's revenge epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/kill-bill-influences/"&gt;Tracking The Many Influences of &amp;#8216;Kill Bill&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/watch-real-movies-and-tv-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/">Once upon a time</a> in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, a person could work in something called a video store. These were brick and mortar businesses full of VHS tapes, Betamax, laserdisc, DVD, HD-DVD and, briefly, Blu-ray, containing the collected works of film history. Or more likely, 35 copies of <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> and a dusty video cassette of <em>Hard Target</em>. These were places you could work after school, shelving endless copies of the newest releases, and watch some cool flicks for free.</p>
<p>Or, <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/understanding-quentin-tarantino/">as <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> did</a>, you could use it as free education, a master&#8217;s degree in watching movies, hoping that someday someone would let you pour your knowledge into a film of your own.</p>
<p>All of Tarantino&#8217;s output has been a mishmash of his obsessions and film history osmosis, but it was the two-part kung-fu epic <strong><em>Kill Bill</em></strong>, a stylish, technicolor, genre-bending opus, that finally let him open up the throttle on his film lore engine and let it rip. It&#8217;s a veritable Pop Up Video of film references, the long historical tendrils of which stretch around the globe and go back decades. The influences are in two parts, broadly speaking; Asian and European and American.</p>
<h3>European and American Cinematic Influences</h3>
<p>The films of Europe and America that Tarantino mines for his <a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/is-the-five-point-palm-exploding-heart-technique-from-kill-bill-real-65db51d00439/">Kung Fu revenge story </a>are wide-ranging, for sure, but they&#8217;re also somewhat convoluted in influence. What seems like a direct inspiration from a European film, for example, actually goes back much further.</p>
<p>The Spaghetti Westerns of <strong>Sergio Leone</strong> are of course a huge influence on <em>Kill Bill</em>. The double exposure shots of the Bride (Uma Thurman) walking away from her grave and Michael Madsen&#8217;s Budd sitting outside his trailer, the overhead shots of the Bride creeping up around Elle Driver in Bud&#8217;s trailer, and the wide-open shots of Texas in the black and white flashbacks all call back to Leone&#8217;s best known films, and Tarantino also uses frequent Leone collaborator <strong>Ennio Morricone</strong> on the soundtrack.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is when one starts to inspect the influences of the Leone films Tarantino references most, the <strong><em>Dollars Trilogy</em></strong>. All three of those films take their inspiration from <strong>Akira Kurosawa</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Yojimbo</em></strong>, the story of a lone samurai coming to the aid of a village against a band of marauders. In this and many other influences, the trail of films that inspired <em>Kill Bill</em> circles back to Asian cinema more often than not.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Bride Wore Black</em></strong>, the 1968 <strong>Francois Truffaut</strong> film about a bride out for revenge on the five men who killed her husband on her wedding day, recalls a tendency in Asian cinema of the 1950s to front-face capable women in strong roles when Western films had yet to arrive at this point.</p>
<p>Even in the many blaxploitation films that Tarantino calls back to we find flares of samurai cinema. From <strong><em>Shaft In Africa</em></strong> to the early films of <strong>Pam Grier</strong>, such as <strong><em>Foxy Brown</em></strong>, lone-wolf style revenge is in large supply, and the non-diegetic musical cues and grandiosely stylized costume design all draw influence from the samurai cinema of the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s and the kabuki theatre that preceded it.</p>
<h3>Asian Cinematic Influences</h3>
<p>Western filmmakers reusing plot elements from Asian films is nothing new, and by the time Tarantino got around to starting his career, some of the most high profile American and European films of all time had already been homages or remakes of Asian films of note. George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, and Sergio Leone owe part of their biggest successes to Asian cinema, to name a few. But while these directors remade or repurposed plots from Japanese or Chinese films and laid them over new templates, Tarantino takes a different approach entirely in <em>Kill Bill</em>.</p>
<p>Rather than just lifting plot elements or characters, Tarantino also uses <em>Kill Bill </em>as a continuation of the stories of characters from films and television past, covertly and overtly. Both volumes of <em>Kill Bill</em> contain the set-ups and introductions of a half dozen characters and plot points that are directly poached from classics of the kung-fu, <em>Jidaigeki, or wuxia</em> genres, as well as Japanese and Chinese crime cinema and episodic television.</p>
<p>The Deadly Viper Assassination squad that the Bride hunts down echoes the protagonists of the <strong>Shaw Brothers</strong> kung fu classic <strong><em>The Five Deadly Venoms</em></strong>, right down to their venomous codenames. <strong>Sonny Chiba</strong>&#8216;s legendary swordsmith Hattori Hanzō somewhat reprises a role he played in the Japanese TV series <strong><em>The Shadow Warriors</em></strong>, which ran for four seasons in the early &#8217;80s and mostly followed the different generations of the Hanzō family (Tarantino has said <em>Kill Bill</em>&#8216;s sword maker is Hattori Hanzō XIV).</p>
<p>Other Shaw Brothers classics are referenced throughout <em>Kill Bill</em>&#8216;s many grandiose fight scenes, including <strong><em>The 36th Chamber of the Shaolin</em></strong> and the <em>wuxia </em>classic <strong><em>One-Armed Swordsman</em></strong>, the over-the-top bloodletting and sword fighting of which is echoed in The House Of Blue Leaves fight sequence featuring The Crazy 88, and the &#8220;crash zoom&#8221; made famous by the studio is also used extensively.</p>
<p>Stylistically, both volumes of <em>Kill Bill </em>draw design and aesthetic inspiration from two classics from Japanese director <strong>Seijun Suzuki</strong>: <strong><em>Tokyo Drifter</em></strong> and <strong><em>Branded To Kill</em></strong>. The first movie offers the technicolor, jazzy, cartoonish vibes of the first installment, including the use of go-go music and club scenes with violent, epic fights. The latter offers the stark, high-contrast black and white that the second film utilizes so well in flashbacks to the Bride&#8217;s wedding day, and both contain a fair amount of the anarchic, surrealist world-building that makes <em>Kill Bill</em> seem to exist in its own self-styled universe.</p>
<p>The film Tarantino poaches from the most, however, is probably the 1973 <strong>Toshiya Fujita</strong> revenge thriller <strong><em>Lady Snowblood</em></strong>. The story of a young assassin who hunts down the criminals who raped her mother and killed her father and brother echoes the plot of <em>Kill Bill</em>. The film even uses illustrated interstitial storyboards for sequences that would have been too expensive to produce, much like Tarantino&#8217;s inclusion of the Production IG animated sequence describing Oren-Ishii&#8217;s childhood.</p>
<p>The final battle between Oren and the Bride in the garden of the House Of Blue Leaves, with Oren in a white kimono, surrounded by lightly falling snow that is eventually sprayed with bright red blood, serves as a visual tribute to the Fujita thriller. And the <em>Lady Snowblood</em> theme song, &#8220;The Flower Of Carnage,&#8221; is featured prominently, sung by Lady Snowblood herself, <strong>Meiko Kaji</strong>.</p>
<p>Tracing the spider&#8217;s web of influence Tarantino uses on any given film could fill a medieval tapestry, but <em>Kill Bill</em> may be his most overt and widest-ranging homage, especially to the Japanese and Chinese cinema that he has taken inspiration from since his beginnings. Although his later films have all contained a wide range of influences and inspiration drawn from film history, <em>Kill Bill</em> is his most personal love letter to the many movies of revenge he consumed during his video store days, a period of time that probably resonates most with the director.</p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;We recommend 10 movies to watch after you see the latest from Quentin Tarantino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-to-watch-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/"&gt;Watch &amp;#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,&amp;#8217; Then Watch These Movies&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a reason I recommend movies to watch after you see a new release. I believe you will better appreciate the new movie by familiarizing yourself with film history, specifically the movies of the past that inform and influence that movie of the present. <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> movies are easy to do this with since he often wears his inspirations on his sleeve.</p>
<p>Or he programs a series of the old films <a href="http://thenewbev.com/forums/topic/july-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at his own movie theater</a> and works with Sony to <a href="https://www.multichannel.com/pr-feed/sony-movie-channel-to-celebrate-columbia-pictures-july-26-theatrical-release-of-quentin-tarantinos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood?source=post_page---------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">curate selections for their cable channel</a> or with Fandango to promote titles <a href="https://www.fandangonow.com/list/tarantino-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-inspiration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to rent or buy on their digital film service</a>. He did all three for his latest, <strong><em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em></strong>. You can also find <a href="https://medium.com/@lindseyj.romain/where-you-can-watch-every-movie-that-inspired-quentin-tarantinos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-d3ae33af4471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a handy guide</a> to all the movies he&#8217;s acknowledged.</p>
<p>Seeing as he&#8217;s covered all the bases for what to watch <em>before </em>seeing his movie, I figured this edition of Movies to Watch After&#8230; would aim for something a little different. These titles didn&#8217;t necessarily influence <em>OUATIH</em>. Watching them might not give you a better appreciation of <em>OUATIH</em>. Rather, I think seeing <em>OUATIH</em> will give you a better appreciation of <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you need anything to help you with the true story of the Manson Family and their murders, don&#8217;t watch anything, just listen to this: Karina Longworth&#8217;s <em>You Must Remember This</em> podcast series from 2015 titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/panoply/you-must-remember-manson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Manson&#8217;s Hollywood</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Echo in the Canyon (2019) and David Crosby: Remember My Name (2019)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342936" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Echo-in-the-Canyon.jpg" alt="Echo In The Canyon" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Echo-in-the-Canyon.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Echo-in-the-Canyon-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Echo-in-the-Canyon-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Two hit documentaries released this year are already a good double feature together. They also can be watched after <em>OUATIH</em> as part of a triple feature. <a href="https://nonfics.com/echo-in-the-canyon-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Echo in the Canyon</strong></em></a> is about the Los Angeles music scene of the mid-1960s with a specific focus on the groups based around Laurel Canyon, while <em><strong>David Crosby: Remember My Name</strong></em> is about David Crosby, who was part of that scene.</p>
<p><em>Echo</em> not only celebrates the Mamas and the Papas, members of which are portrayed in Tarantino&#8217;s movie (specifically Cass Elliot and Michelle Phillips, portrayed respectively by Rebecca Rittenhouse and Rachel Redleaf), but it also features clips from Jacques Demy&#8217;s <em><strong>Model Shop</strong></em>, a movie that also heavily influenced <em>OUATIH</em>. <em>Echo</em> filmmakers Andrew Slater and Jakob Dylan suggest <em>Model Shop</em> also just looks like how the era of the LA music scene felt.</p>
<p>As for the Crosby doc, for which producer Cameron Crowe has said <em>Echo</em> serves as a preview, it&#8217;s a good fit with <em>OUATIH</em> because there&#8217;s a moment when its subject says he&#8217;d have been better than Dennis Hopper in <em><strong>Easy Rider</strong></em> (another movie on Tarantino&#8217;s list of <em>OUATIH</em> influences). There&#8217;s even an imagined exchange as if Crosby was in that movie using intercut clips, similar to when <em>OUATIH</em> inserts Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton in <em><strong>The Great Escape</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Echo in the Canyon</strong></em><strong> and <em>David Crosby: Remember My Name </em>are now playing in theaters.</strong></p>

<h3>The Hero (2017)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342944" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thehero-samelliott-hills.jpg" alt="Thehero Samelliott Hills" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thehero-samelliott-hills.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thehero-samelliott-hills-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thehero-samelliott-hills-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Brett Haley&#8217;s <em><strong>The Hero</strong></em> should have been an awards darling a couple of years ago, at least for star Sam Elliott, for whom it was written and which seemed almost made with Oscar in mind (the Academy maybe realized this when finally nominating him for <em>A Star is Born</em> a year later). Like <em>OUATIH</em>, it&#8217;s about an aging star of Westerns in need of a return to glory, or just decent work.</p>
<p>For many reasons, though, <em>The Hero</em>, is nothing like Tarantino&#8217;s movie. It&#8217;s set in the present, it&#8217;s inspired by its own star&#8217;s own career rather than icons of the past (Elliott got his start at the time <em>OUATIH </em>is set, even appearing on such TV series as <em>The F.B.I. </em>and <em>Lancer</em>), and there&#8217;s a lot more drama with its romantic and estranged daughter storylines. But there&#8217;s also some film industry send-up, albeit played straight &#8212; if Rick Dalton was around today, perhaps he&#8217;d be auditioning for YA franchises, too.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.71428rem; font-weight: 900;">The Nice Guys (2016)</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342937" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Nice-Guys.jpg" alt="The Nice Guys" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Nice-Guys.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Nice-Guys-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Nice-Guys-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>In its opening weekend, <em>OUATIH</em> has already grossed more than the total domestic take of <em><strong>The Nice Guys</strong></em>. So, as well known as it should be, I assume a lot of people seeing Tarantino&#8217;s latest haven&#8217;t seen Shane Black&#8217;s detective comedy masterpiece. But should. As great as DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are as a dynamic duo in <em>OUATIH</em>, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling very well might top them in this.</p>
<p><em>The Nice Guys</em> is set almost a decade later than the events of OUATIH but is also in and around LA at another turning point of the film industry, namely when porn was peaking. The movie also features <em>OUATIH</em> standout <strong>Margaret Qualley</strong> (aka miniature Andie MacDowell) as the girl the &#8220;nice guys&#8221; are hired to find in a goofy noir-ish plot involving an automaker conspiracy.</p>

<h3>Double Dare (2004)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342943" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zoe-bell-double-dare.jpg" alt="Zoe Bell Double Dare" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zoe-bell-double-dare.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zoe-bell-double-dare-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zoe-bell-double-dare-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>In 2001, the popular syndicated series <em>Xena: Warrior Princess</em> concluded its lengthy run, leaving Lucy Lawless stunt double <strong>Zoe Bell</strong> out of a job. She eventually moves to the US and gets hired to double for Uma Thurman in <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em>. Numerous collaborations with Tarantino later, she&#8217;s the stunt coordinator on <em>OUATIH</em> with a brief onscreen role as well.</p>
<p><em><strong>Double Dare</strong></em> is a documentary that follows Bell&#8217;s career through that whole transition and may even have itself affected her life by leading to her (with financial assistance from the filmmakers) to become acquaintances with people, especially fellow stuntperson doc subject Jeannie Epper, who helped steer her toward her American breakout. On top of that, the film is just a fascinating look at and celebration of women stunt performers.</p>

<h3>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342942" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-spy-who-shagged-me.jpg" alt="The Spy Who Shagged Me" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-spy-who-shagged-me.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-spy-who-shagged-me-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-spy-who-shagged-me-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>The Wrecking Crew</strong></em> gets a very nice showcase in a scene with Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in <em>OUATIH</em>. The fourth and final installment of the Matt Helm spy action-comedy franchise has otherwise not had much of a legacy in its 50 years of existence. Thanks to Tarantino, however, his fans are now checking out the James Bond send-up after seeing clips of it in <em>OUATIH</em>.</p>
<p>Before its prominence in <em>OUATIH</em>, <em>The Wrecking Crew</em> partly inspired the second <em><strong>Austin Powers</strong></em> movie, <em><strong>The Spy Who Shagged Me</strong></em>. Mike Myers&#8217; spy comedy sequel is more of a parody of James Bond parodies than a James Bond parody, and as such, it features a character modeled after Tate&#8217;s Freya Carlson combined with Anya Amazova from <em><strong>The Spy Who Loved Me</strong></em>: Heather Graham&#8217;s Felicity Shagwell.</p>
<p>The first <em>Austin Powers</em> movie also seems to reference <em>The Wrecking Crew</em> in its joke about England not looking anything like Southern California. The Matt Helm sequel features a chase scene through the &#8220;Dutch Alps&#8221; that is clearly shot in California. It&#8217;s safe to say that if you see <em>The Wrecking Crew</em> and then other Helm movies (including <strong><em>The Silencers</em></strong>, <em><strong>Murderers&#8217; Row</strong></em>, and <strong><em>The Ambushers</em></strong>, none of which feature Tate), you&#8217;ll want to watch the <em>Austin Powers</em> films.</p>

<h3>Tess (1979)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342941" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tess.jpeg" alt="Tess" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tess.jpeg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tess-150x107.jpeg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tess-640x457.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>In <em>OUATIH</em>, Tate is shown picking up a copy of Thomas Hardy&#8217;s <em>Tess of the d&#8217;Urbervilles </em>as a gift for her husband, Roman Polanski. She was known to have recently read the book before her murder and suggested Polanski adapt it into a feature film. And that he did, a decade later, with young Nastassja Kinski starring as the titular character in this production, which went on to a Best Picture nomination and three Oscar wins.</p>
<p>Had she not died then, Tate very likely would have played the lead in <strong><em>Tess</em></strong> in a movie made by Polanski. She would have been too old for the part if they&#8217;d waited until 1978 to make it, but she expressed interest in the role when she gave her husband the book and they probably would have done it sooner than later. Alas, she was killed, but <em>Tess</em> is dedicated &#8220;To Sharon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout <em>OUATIH</em>, even before it was confirmed that Tate would live in the alternate history ending of the movie&#8217;s universe, I thought she might and hoped Tarantino would have an <em><strong>American Grafitti</strong></em> type pre-credits epilogue showing where the characters are now and what movies and TV shows they did after 1969 &#8212; or even showed Robbie as Tate inserted into them.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2LPICi2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rent or buy <em>Tess </em>from Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3>Hooper (1978)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342940" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hooper.jpg" alt="Hooper" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hooper.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hooper-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hooper-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Tarantino has constantly shown his love for stunt work and stunt performers throughout his career, including in his collaboration with Zoe Bell and his characters portrayed by Kurt Russell in <em>Death Proof </em>and now <em>OUATIH</em>. His latest movie, however, is his greatest homage to the profession via Pitt&#8217;s character, Cliff Booth.</p>
<p><em>Hooper</em> is a similar appreciation of stunt performers in a fictional film. Directed by iconic stuntman and coordinator Hal Needham, it stars his frequent collaborator <strong>Burt Reynolds</strong> (whom Needham sometimes doubled for early on) as an aging stuntman who was once considered the greatest in his line of work. He&#8217;s working on a spy movie when he meets a new stuntman whom he befriends yet also initially competes with.</p>
<p>Considering Reynolds was initially such a big part of <em>OUATIH</em> &#8212; he&#8217;s replaced in the episode of <em>The F.B.I.</em> and was meant to himself appear in the movie portraying George Spahn and also portrayed by James Marsden &#8212; it&#8217;s fun to imagine his later movies as being vehicles for the fictional Rick Dalton. Maybe he would have starred in <em>Hooper</em> as helmed by Booth.</p>
<p>I also recommend the criminally underseen 2016 Needham-focused documentary <strong><em>The Bandit</em></strong>, in which the stuntman turned filmmaker reflects on his life and career.</p>

<h3>Lions Love (&#8230; and Lies) (1969)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342939" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lions-Love.jpg" alt="Lions Love" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lions-Love.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lions-Love-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lions-Love-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>When Jacques Demy went to Hollywood to make <em>Model Shop</em> (already mentioned above as a major influence on <em>OUATIH</em>), his wife, filmmaker Agnes Varda, joined him and made some movies of her own. Among her California period works (collected in a great Criterion set) were some short documentaries and the metafictional hybrid <strong><em>Lions Love (&#8230; and Lies)</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Perfectly <a href="https://nonfics.com/agn%C3%A8s-varda-in-california-a-french-new-waver-surfs-the-wild-west-6c33da55426e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described by our own Landon Palmer</a> as &#8220;<strong><em>Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice</em></strong> (another influence on OUATIH) meets <em>Gimme Shelter</em>,&#8221; Varda&#8217;s movie follows Warhol star Viva in her polyamorous relationship with Hair composers Jerry Ragni and James Rado as they navigate Hollywood alongside Shirley Clarke playing both herself and a stand-in for Varda.</p>
<p>Although shot in 1968 (Robert F. Kennedy&#8217;s assassination affects the tone and story), simultaneous to the <em>Model Shop</em> production, <em>Lions Love (&#8230; and Lies)</em> provides some documentary material for what the setting of <em>OUATIH</em> looked and felt like for real around the same time. And yet it&#8217;s also, like <em>Model Shop</em> and <em>OUATIH</em> a cinematic dream of LA, too.</p>

<h3>It Happened Here (1964)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-342938" src="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/It-Happened-Here.jpg" alt="It Happened Here" width="700" height="500" srcset="https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/It-Happened-Here.jpg 700w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/It-Happened-Here-150x107.jpg 150w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/It-Happened-Here-640x457.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Before Tarantino came along and started making happily ever after revisionist histories concerning Hitler and Manson, the trend with the genre was to go with darker fates. Rather than seeing inglourious basterds wipe out most of the top Nazis, movies imagined Nazis succeeding in their master plans and expanding their reign further than was true.</p>
<p><em><strong>It Happened Here</strong></em> is one of the earliest alternative history movies as well as the earliest project of filmmakers and historians Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo, who began the project as teenagers in the mid-1950s and eventually finished it with support from Stanley Kubrick and Tony Richardson. It&#8217;s also the first work of <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> DP Peter Suschitzky.</p>
<p>The plot of the film follows an Irish nurse in Nazi-occupied England, which is said to have been taken by the Germans in 1940 following the Dunkirk evacuation and is supported by a now fascist British government. By its end, we can assume the Allies still win the war in this parallel universe but the What If? themes of indoctrination and collaboration are the focus.</p>
<p>Despite my aforementioned desire to have seen Tarantino answer the questions of where are they now, revisionist history stories can get tricky with such lengthy consequential speculation. Perhaps the real events of <em>OUATIH</em> were also course corrected and Manson came back the next day to kill Tate and Seberg (in the true timeline, he actually did something similar in response to the events of that night but elsewhere). Movies like <em>It Happened Here</em> and <em>OUATIH</em> are best as closed narratives.</p>

				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hauer made his mark in numerous iconic performances, but his spin on Zatoichi should not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/rutger-hauer-blind-fury/"&gt;Rutger Hauer: The Gentle Badass of &amp;#8216;Blind Fury&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://filmschoolrejects.com"&gt;Film School Rejects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the days following <strong>Rutger Hauer</strong>&#8216;s passing, the usual array of classics fluttered through the mourning conversation: <strong><em>Blade Runner</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Hitcher</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hobo With A Shotgun</em></strong>, and maybe <strong><em>Nighthawks</em></strong> or <strong><em>Sin City</em></strong>. The actor exhibited an intoxicating antagonism on screen, causing many of his more nefarious roles to stand apart from the<strong> <em>Ladyhawk</em></strong>s and <strong><em>Wedlock</em></strong>s of his filmography. He made an evil you were all too happy to guzzle down.</p>
<p>I love those bouts of artful wretchedness. There was always a point of view, and usually, at some moment in the narrative, Hauer could pull his audience over to his side of twisted thinking. &#8220;Roy Batty Was Right!&#8221; Strap that slogan on a t-shirt, and I will wear it. No doubt.</p>
<p>Yet, the first film to flash in my mind when I heard of Hauer&#8217;s demise was not a classic but an action cheapie barely noticed during its 1989 theatrical run. <strong><em>Blind Fury</em></strong> is an atypical action flick that provides plenty of severed limbs and rampant shootouts without ever falling into a mean nature. The film has no need for Hauer&#8217;s anxious energy, requesting a serene and mellow mood instead. As Nick Parker, a veteran who lost his sight while protecting a comrade from explosive harm, Hauer exudes an inviting and gentle demeanor. The character makes no request for violence, but it appears when loyalty and honor are challenged.</p>
<p>Vietnam took the valor out of warfare. With cameras on the ground, approximating the realities of combat for the nightly news, the public perception warped drastically from those <em>To Hell and Back</em> glory days of World War II cinema. Soldiers no longer strode with righteous swagger, trading square jaws for furrowed brows and sunken sockets. John Wayne was out, Jon Voight and Martin Sheen were in. Anger took the place of altruism.</p>
<p>Hollywood of the 1970s explored the trauma of the battlefield and the wounds it ruptured across the homefront. Politics muddied everything, and there was no going back even when the 1980s desperately saught black and white morality in the red terror of <em>Rambo</em> sequels. Through the moral confusion of Vietnam, Sylvester Stallone introduced an acceptable vulnerability to the trigger-happy avenger and an added layer of empathy began to surround our action war heroes. I feel, therefore I kill.</p>
<p>From Stallone came the <em>Missing in Action</em> knockoffs starring Chuck Norris, <em>Deadly Prey</em>, <em>Strike Command, </em>and a half dozen others. In this violent context, actor <strong>Tim Matheson</strong> desired to enter the realm of producing. His heart, however, belonged to a completely different reluctant-yet-justified warrior: Zatoichi, the blind masseur with his walking stick/samurai sword surprise. The character appears in 26 features, a hundred episodes of television, and one remake. Any number of plots could have been used to transplant the character&#8217;s zen cool into a western context, but Matheson zeroed in <strong><em>Zatoichi Challenged</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1967 in Japan (three years later in the US), the 17th feature in the series has Zatoichi sharing a room at an inn with an ill woman and her son. Before she dies, the woman begs Zatoichi to deliver the boy to his father. The blind swordsman agrees reluctantly and in accomplishing the task comes to discover the boy&#8217;s father to be bankrupt of decency. Blades are crossed many times, and Zatoichi remains unscathed for the next feature.</p>
<p>In <em>Blind Fury</em>, Nick Parker makes a similar promise to the wife (<strong>Meg Foster</strong>) of his old war buddy. She dies in his arms after a gang of henchmen attempts to kidnap her son as a bargaining chip against the chemist father (<strong>Terry O&#8217;Quinn</strong>) financially trapped into producing a lucrative batch of narcotics for a Reno mob boss. Most of the film is a road trip adventure in which every rest stop is marked by the bisected corpse of some foolish goon. Hauer swings each killing stroke with an apologetic grimace, and the joy comes in anticipating the next dead man to underestimate his skill.</p>
<p>Hauer <a href="http://www.rutgerhauer.org/plots/blind.php">cited on his website</a> that <em>Blind Fury</em> was one of his most difficult performances. The swordsmanship took weeks of study but fell in line with his philosophy of finding the character through physicality. He took up fencing at a young age as an homage to the French swashbuckling adventure <em>Fanfan la Tulipe</em>, and gravitated to the notion that acting is merely an extension of dancing; to control the body is to control the mind. A preparation of sorts began earlier in the decade when Paul Verhoeven asked him to wield the broad sword in the 1985 Medieval drama <strong><em>Flesh + Blood</em></strong>. If he could swing that brute around his head, surely he could figure out Zatoichi&#8217;s trick Kitana.</p>
<p>So, while the swordplay might be mastered, or at least effectively displayed through prowess and editing, the larger hurdle presented itself in Nick Parker&#8217;s blindness. Inhabiting the impairment was achievable, but the blind swordsman concept was an imaginative leap too far. Yes, he happily enjoyed the <em>Zatoichi</em> films as entertainments, but he was unable to justify the reality and struggled to discover a logical in for the character. That changed during a chance encounter with martial artist <strong>Lynn Manning</strong> while visiting the Los Angeles Braille Institute.</p>
<p>Manning lost his sight in 1978 as the result of a barroom challenge that escalated into a bullet being fired directly into one eye only for it to lodge behind the other. Refusing to fall into despair, Manning joined a judo program where he learned to compete on the same level as the sighted. Since matches begin mid-grip, Judo suggests that anticipating movement is predominantly achieved through feeling rather than vision. Manning moved himself up the ranks of multiple tournaments and earned a position on the 1988 US Paralympics team.</p>
<p>Hauer <a href="https://people.com/archive/rutger-hauer-owes-his-nice-judo-moves-in-blind-fury-to-sightless-martial-arts-expert-lynn-manning-vol-33-no-18/">told <em>People</em> magazine</a> in 1990, &#8220;Lynn taught me how to unfocus my eyes, to react to smells and sounds.&#8221; The actor found his real-life Zatoichi, and in doing so, discovered a connection to the B movie plot he once thought impossible. Hauer was in awe of the athlete, &#8220;He could pick up the patters of your breathing if you were upset.&#8221; Their friendly, brief conversation quickly transformed into a gig as Manning joined the crew as a technical advisor for Hauer. The actor wanted to return the favor by teaching Manning to ski and uncovered another impossible skill. &#8220;Once outside our hotel, Lynn called out my name, and I answered. He hit me with a snowball from 50 feet away, just from the sound of my voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, imagine that level of commitment extended out to every one of the 173 roles listed on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000442/">Hauer&#8217;s MDb page</a>? The man was not a point-and-shoot performer. No matter how silly or fantastical the plots might have been, for Hauer to take on your movie, he needed to comprehend the person he was living. We obviously appreciated that devotion, but it was a dedication not meant for us, and instead, for that little kid he once was; the one that saw dance in the performance. Hauer always needed to know the moves before he could ever get out on that dance floor.</p>
