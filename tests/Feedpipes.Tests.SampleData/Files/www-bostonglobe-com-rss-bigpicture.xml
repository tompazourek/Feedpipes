The salt water of the harbor “cut” the molasses and eventually the welders could see the structure of the original tank.

It was just a happy accident. The light was soft and hit them in this shadowless way. These girls in beautiful costumes were a great contrast to an ugly building.

<title>100th anniversary of the end of WWI</title>http:<description>Sunday Nov. 11, 2018 marks the 100-year anniversary of the signing of the Armistice to end World War One. This was the Great War, called “the European War” or “the World War” by contemporaries. Ten million combatants would die before it ended with Germany’s defeat on Nov. 11, 1918. Its bloody battlegrounds, the Somme, Verdun, the Marne, and others, still epitomize apparently pointless human sacrifice. Those who survived the trenches of the Western Front believed civilization could never again sink so low.

<title>A home, but for how long?</title>http:<description> For 19 years, the US government had given Patricia Carbajal permission to stay in this country, to work, to put down roots. For 19 years, administration after administration extended Temporary Protected Status for Honduras after the destruction wrought by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 was compounded by crippling poverty, destabilizing corruption, and violence so pervasive that the murder rate in Honduras is now among the highest in the world. After 19 years, Patricia’s status had long ago stopped feeling temporary.  But, now, in a moment, everything could change. Now, the Trump administration has canceled the program that had allowed her to create a life as a mother, a construction worker, a budding activist. Over seven months, she watched as the federal government rescinded Temporary Protected Status for country after country, stripping the legal right to live and work in the United States from some 250,000 people who were expected to renew their status. South Sudan. Nicaragua. Haiti. El Salvador. Nepal.  She was about to learn that Honduras would be next.

A number of countries have had their TPS status revoked. On the day of the announcement of the future of the Honduras program, she anxiously hugged her 4-year-old daughter, Camila, in their kitchen.

<title>Life in the bleachers at Fenway Park</title>http:<description> Baseball is never boring in the bleachers. Just ask the Red Sox players who are out there. “The bleachers are fun,” says Sox reliever Joe Kelly. “They’re probably the most fun group in the stadium. It’s kind of like a party out there. But I think they are the most knowledgeable of fans and the most intense. I’m a big fan of them.” Red Sox pitching coach Dana LeVangie has seen it all in the bleachers since becoming bullpen catcher in 1997. He remembers Literacy Night in 2001 where fans received a poster of Sox pitcher Derek Lowe. But in the 9th inning that night Lowe blew the save. When LeVangie hurriedly grabbed his mitt to warm up Rod Beck they were both bombarded. “Before you know it there seemed like 1000 airplanes came down at us and they were big and they were landing on the field and sticking in. It was like the D Day invasion,” says LeVangie. Now there’s more families, better security, and the players are fan friendly. They give the kids gum, sunflower seeds and baseballs. “We’re trying to get them on our side,” he says. -- by Stan Grossfeld/Globe Staff

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is executing the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy towards undocumented immigrants. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions also said that domestic and gang violence in immigrants’ country of origin would no longer qualify them for political asylum status.

<title>Opioids land more women behind bars</title>http:<description> This lone county jail in a remote corner of Appalachia offers an agonizing glimpse into how the tidal wave of opioids and methamphetamines has ravaged America. Here and in countless other places, addiction is driving skyrocketing rates of incarcerated women, tearing apart families while squeezing communities that lack money, treatment programs and permanent solutions to close the revolving door. More than a decade ago, there were rarely more than 10 women in the Campbell County Jail in northeast Tennessee. Now the population is routinely around 60. Most who end up here have followed a similar path: they’re arrested on a drug-related charge and confined to a cell 23 hours a day. Many of their bunkmates also are addicts. They receive no counseling. Then weeks, months or years later, they’re released into the same community where friends - and in some cases, family - are using drugs. Soon they are again, too. And the cycle begins anew: Another arrest, another booking photo, another pink uniform and off to a cell to simmer in regret and despair.
