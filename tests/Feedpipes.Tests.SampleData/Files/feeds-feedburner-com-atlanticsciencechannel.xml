It originated somewhere in Asia about 6,000 years ago, when a cell in the genitals of an unknown dog developed mutations that allowed it to multiply uncontrollably. That is, it became a tumor. But unlike almost every other cancer, which ultimately goes down with its host, this one did not. Somehow, it gained the ability to spread from one dog to another through sexual contact. And in doing so, it achieved a kind of immortality. The original dog is long gone, but its contagious cancer—known as canine transmissible venereal tumor, or CTVT—lives on, having hopped around the world on the junk of humanity’s best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To clarify, several cancers can be caused by infectious entities; cervical cancer, for example, is the work of HPV, a sexually transmitted virus. But in those cases, the cancer itself is not infectious and cannot spread. CTVT is different: Each cancer cell is a free-living parasite that can set up another tumor on another dog. Among wild animals, there are only eight known examples of such transmissible tumors. Two grow on the faces of the unlucky Tasmanian devils. Five spread between shellfish. None are as ancient, prolific, or successful as CTVT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team led by Elizabeth Murchison of the University of Cambridge has finished the largest study of CTVT yet, comparing the DNA of 546 tumors collected from dogs around the world. The team’s study reads like an epic biography of this unusual cancer, and it shows just how strange an entity CTVT really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/domestication-gave-dogs-two-new-eye-muscles/591868/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Why do dogs look so sad?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a typical tumor grows, it also evolves. New cells inherit the mutations of their parents, before picking up new ones of their own. This process of constant change means that cells at opposite ends of a tumor can be genetically different, as can those that spread (or metastasize) to other organs. By comparing these patterns of mutations and working backwards, scientists can identify which mutations arose when and where, and work out how a tumor originated, evolved, and spread. But they usually do this for samples collected from a single body. Murchison’s team did it for samples collected from six continents. “We mapped out a metastasis on a global scale, over thousands of years,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Her team calculated that CTVT arose 4,000 to 8,500 years ago, somewhere in Central Asia. It then stayed there for millennia, perhaps because it emerged in a population of dogs that were isolated from others. For whatever reason, that seclusion broke about 1,900 years ago, and the tumor slowly spread west through Asia to Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its movements accelerated about 500 years ago, when it hitched a ride to the Americas on the genitals of colonizers’ dogs and spread quickly once it arrived. In the 18th century, one particular lineage of CTVT made the return trip, and swept through Europe and Africa. Most of today’s CTVT tumors are descended from that American lineage. Colonization, globalization, and homogenization: The recent history of CTVT is not unlike our own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The tumor’s genes reveal not just the route of its travels, but also some of its encounters along the way. Many carcinogens mutate DNA in distinctive ways: Sunlight, for example, creates a very different pattern of mutations than cigarette smoke. Murchison’s team found that CTVT contains a lot of those sunlight signatures, especially at lower latitudes, where the sun is stronger. For example, CTVT in Mauritius has more sunlight-induced mutations than the same tumor in Russia. Based on that trend, the team could calculate how many sunlight-related mutations the original CTVT tumors would have had and, from that, the latitude at which the founder dog probably lived. “It points to China as a likely origin,” Murchison says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But one pattern of mutations was less clear-cut. Repeatedly, the team saw stretches of DNA where one particular quintet—GTCCA—had changed into GTTCA. (DNA is a chain of four building blocks that can be represented by the letters &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.) And that pattern has never been seen before, in any other cancer, from any other species. Weirder still, that signature accounted for a third of CTVT’s mutations during its early past, but hasn’t cropped up again in the past two millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very mysterious,” Murchison says. “This cancer was exposed to something that caused this very particular mutation, and has never been seen in any human cancer ever, and that seems to have stopped 2,000 years ago. We don’t know what that carcinogen is, and we’d love to. I guess it was probably something in the dogs’ environment? This is a very crazy idea and we don’t really believe it, but maybe ancient people who owned the dogs tried to treat [their tumors] with some kind of chemical?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/dog-neutering-health-risks-for-certain-breeds/594355/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The quietly changing consensus on neutering dogs&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the source of CTVT’s mutations, it has clearly accumulated a lot of them. Put it this way: Today’s tumors are about as genetically different from the founder dog as two distantly related dogs are to each other. “CTVT is like its own organism,” Murchison says. “It isn’t really a dog. Is it a cancer, still?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There’s good reason to think that the answer is no. Sure, it’s a tumor, but one that behaves in very strange ways. For example, one of the hallmarks of cancer is genomic instability. That is, it is constantly mutating, duplicating or deleting genes, rearranging entire chromosomes. To look at a cancer genome is to stare at chaos. CTVT, by contrast, is a picture of stability. Yes, it has a lot of mutations, but that’s because it’s been around for thousands of years. If anything, it acquires new ones at a slower rate than you’d expect for a cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Also, the majority of those mutations, including almost all of the recent ones, are neutral. They don’t seem to benefit the tumor in any way. Again, that’s very different from most cancers, which are constantly adapting to outfox their hosts’ immune systems, or to grow a little faster, or to spread to new areas. Not so with CTVT. “We think that the cancer is not adapting anymore,” says Adrian Baez-Ortega, who was one of the main researchers on the study. “Maybe it doesn’t really need to.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps, early on in CTVT’s history, it found such thorough ways of escaping the immune system and jumping into new hosts that no further tweaks were necessary. Or perhaps it no longer imposes enough harm on its hosts to warrant a counterattack. It’s rarely fatal, after all, and if dogs are otherwise healthy, it doesn’t grow very fast. “The tumor and the dogs aren’t competing against each other anymore,” Baez-Ortega says. “They’re coexisting. The cells behave like cancer cells, but the ecology of the tumor is that of a parasite.” And a fairly benign one at that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Doctors should take note. In lieu of aggressive chemotherapy, which drives the evolution of resistant and recurrent tumors, some researchers are looking at a strategy called adaptive therapy. Their plan is to treat cancers intermittently and gently, enough to control them, but not enough to trigger the rise of resistance. The goal is not to cure, but to tame—to turn a tumor into a long-term but manageable problem. And CTVT shows that “a tumor can be tamed by evolution,” Baez-Ortega says. It can evolve toward low-key survival instead of aggressive growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its future is uncertain, though. While failing to acquire beneficial mutations, CTVT is also failing to weed out harmful ones. That’s understandable, because much of its DNA comprises genes for building a dog. It can afford to let those mutate into obsolescence. But over time, the genes that it still needs will also take hits. Slowly, the tumor will become weaker and less efficient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Evolutionary biologists have long predicted that purely asexual organisms—those that reproduce by cloning themselves instead of having sex—are doomed to this fate, which is why they’re incredibly rare. CTVT seems to be proving them right. “Is it an evolutionary dead end?” wonders Hannah Siddle of the University of Southampton, who studies contagious cancers. “Is it gradually becoming more unstable under its increasing random mutational burden?” Baez-Ortega thinks so: “I don’t see this surviving for millions of years,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Humans have sped up the tumor’s demise by treating it with chemotherapy—a surprisingly easy feat because, unlike most cancers, it doesn’t seem to evolve resistance to drugs. Indeed, almost all the 546 dogs sampled in Murchison’s study were cured, even when their tumors had metastasized. “That’s astounding,” she says. “CTVT is probably one of the most curable cancers we know of.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But I wonder, when we talk about cure, do we really mean extinction? CTVT is a unique biological entity—not quite a cancer, not quite a dog, and not quite like anything else. There’s a growing movement to protect unglamorous parasites alongside more charismatic fauna. Is CTVT, with genetic collapse on its horizon, a case for conservation instead of cure? Would anyone seriously propose saving a tumor?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“I think you could make that argument, but not at the expense of dogs’ welfare,” Murchison says. “They do recover, but chemotherapy is not nice. I wouldn’t personally be concerned if CTVT was eradicated from the dog population, but if it was kept in a museum, that would be ideal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“It would be very sad if it disappeared from the planet,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ed Yong</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/GettyImages_597243451/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jules Clark / Getty</media:credit><media:description>Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumor, a contagious cancer, first developed thousands of years ago.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Thousands of Years Ago, a Dog Gave Rise to an Immortal Entity</title><published>2019-08-01T14:02:43-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T15:06:05-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The story of CTVT—a contagious cancer that spreads from dog to dog—gets weirder all the time.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/ctvt-tumor-broke-all-rules/595246/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595303</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It started as a good day. As usual, Kevin Langergraber got up at dawn to follow and observe the chimpanzees of Ngogo in Uganda’s Kibale National Park. An anthropologist from Arizona State University, he has been &lt;a href="http://ngogochimpanzeeproject.org/research/"&gt;studying that group&lt;/a&gt; for 19 summers. This year, food has been scarce, and so have the chimps. But yesterday Langergraber found a group of 30 adults, playing and relaxing, with infants crawling all over them. “It was just me and 30 chimps,” he says. “I was so happy. And it just turned so quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, the chimps were on the move, traversing a familiar route between two stretches of forest. Shortly after they reentered the trees, Langergraber, who was right behind them, heard one of them scream. He thought they had stumbled onto a buffalo or an elephant, but when he ran up to them, he was shocked to see two people. Poachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langergraber ran at them, shouting. One angry scientist is hardly a threat, but he could have had more people, or armed rangers, behind him. The poachers fled. Their dogs didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poachers had brought a few dozen hunting dogs. Half of them were mauling a female chimp named Kidman and her 25-day-old infant. Another small pack was tearing at Jumbo, Kidman’s six-year-old son. Langergraber ran up and started kicking the dogs, to no avail. Then he realized that a spear was sticking out of Kidman’s back. He pulled it out and started spearing the dogs attacking Jumbo. The dogs and chimp tumbled down a hill, and Langergraber ran after them. Eventually he had killed or wounded enough of the dogs for Jumbo to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langergraber climbed back up the hill to find Kidman on the ground, bleeding out, still being mauled. Her adult son Elton and his close friend Hicks were trying to chase the dogs away, and Langergraber joined in. Hicks fled with Kidman’s wounded infant. “In the end, it was just me and Elton fighting off dogs,” Langergraber says. They eventually succeeded, but it was too late for Kidman, who died a few minutes later, either from the two spear wounds in her back or the injuries inflicted by the dogs. Elton went up to her, sniffed her one last time, and fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/can-humans-understand-chimps/536826/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Can humans understand chimpanzees?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been 10 minutes since Langergraber heard the scream, and he was standing there surrounded by seven dead dogs, several wounded ones, a spear covered in both chimp and dog blood, and the body of a chimp he had known for 19 years. “It was just horrible,” Langergraber says. “You know chimps die, but when it happens right before your eyes, it’s so real. And it was hard having to spear all these dogs. I’m a dog lover. But it had to be done.” &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/NgogoChimps/photos/a.360431887334189/2591732864204069/?type=3&amp;amp;theater"&gt;He stayed with Kidman’s body for four hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, Langergraber’s colleagues found Hicks still with Kidman’s infant, carrying it on his stomach as mothers usually do, and as adult males very much don’t. Today the team learned that the infant is dead. Even if it hadn’t been mauled, it likely wouldn’t have survived without its mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="499" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/08/Kidman_and_infant/6a20329d2.jpg" width="383"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Kidman and her infant, taken three days ago (Kevin Langergraber / Ngogo Chimpanzee Project)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ngogo community is the largest known group of chimps, and researchers have been studying them—and trying to protect them—since 1995. Kidman, who was 42 and named after the actress Nicole Kidman, was one of the most beloved individuals there. After surviving a recent bout of respiratory illness, she developed a loud wheeze. Perhaps that made her easier to track. Relaxed and good-natured, she showed little fear of people, and would often fall asleep in front of researchers, cuddling her infants. Perhaps that made her easier to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of debate about whether animals grieve, and it’s easy to read human emotions into animal behavior. But it’s equally hard to argue that chimps don’t mourn or feel loss. Mothers have been seen carrying around the &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18818-how-chimps-mourn-their-dead/"&gt;mummified corpses&lt;/a&gt; of babies that died weeks ago. Daughters have been filmed grooming their dying mothers, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2010/04/chimps-grieve-over-dead-relatives"&gt;and keeping a sort of vigil as they died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Ngogo, a male named Ellington went missing in 2002. He might have been killed by poachers, or even other chimps, but whatever the case, his absence profoundly affected his closest companion, a male named Hare. Once sociable, Hare became withdrawn. He’d show up in big groups, walk around, and quickly depart. John Mitani, who leads the Ngogo Chimpanzee Project, wondered if he was looking for his friend. And Langergraber wonders if the other chimps will react to Kidman’s absence in the same way. “Unless you were one of those 25 chimps that were there, you’d just not see Kidman anymore,” he says. “You’d have no idea why.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/we-are-destroying-chimpanzee-cultures/584146/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Chimpanzee traditions are disappearing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the chimps that witnessed the mauling were extremely close to Kidman. Harper, Hicks’s mother, is one of the oldest females in the group, and had been Kidman’s best friend for decades. Elton, her son, was of the age when male chimps split off from their mothers, but he still stuck to her. Her other son, Jumbo, who was also mauled, is still missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence is an inextricable part of nature, and chimpanzees both suffer it and inflict it. They murder one another. They wage war. Those at Ngogo hunt red colobus monkeys for food. A civil war is also brewing, as the 200-strong group of chimps is fracturing in two and longtime allies are becoming enemies. A male, Basie, was killed by a former ally just this summer. “It’s tough, but you sort of accept it as natural chimp behavior,” Langergraber says. But the poaching “is just … I don’t know … It feels so much worse. It’s senseless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other parts of Africa, chimps are often killed for bushmeat, but in Uganda, there are local taboos against eating primates. Poachers more often go after bushpigs and forest hogs. But if they come across chimps, they will sometimes kill them and feed them to their dogs. That’s what the duo whom Langergraber scared away were likely doing. And they got away, too. Anti-poaching squads tracked them for miles, but their sniffer dogs lost the scent after running into a herd of elephants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This probably happens all the time, but this was a story where someone saw it,” Langergraber says. “And it happened to a chimp that people have studied since 1995. We know her family, her history. We have beautiful photos of her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langergraber has run into poachers in the field before, but never in the midst of killing chimps. More often, chimps are caught in snares that the poachers set for antelope and pigs; around a third of Ngogo’s chimps have snare-related injuries. Kibale now has &lt;a href="http://ngogochimpanzeeproject.org/conservation/"&gt;three anti-poaching teams&lt;/a&gt;, including armed rangers from Uganda Wildlife Authority and snare-removal experts led by “Big James” Tibisimwa. He used to be a poacher himself, but gave up that life when Kibale became a national park. He worked as a cook and cleaner for the Ngogo research project, before using his experience to train anti-poaching officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams are skilled and effective, and poaching declines in areas where they work. But they also have to cover 300 square miles of forest and grassland. “It’s a constant battle to &lt;a href="http://ngogochimpanzeeproject.org/how-you-can-help/"&gt;fund these anti-poaching teams&lt;/a&gt;, and we wanted to raise money to hire two more,” Langergraber says. “This has been a good kick in the butt to get that going.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ed Yong</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/Webp.net_resizeimage/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Kevin Langergraber / Ngogo Chimpanzee Project</media:credit><media:description>Kidman, a chimpanzee, now dead</media:description></media:content><title type="html">A Scientist Witnessed Poachers Killing a Chimp</title><published>2019-08-01T12:43:48-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T16:39:22-04:00</updated><summary type="html">When Kevin Langergraber heard a scream in the rain forest, he ran to see what was happening.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/death-chimpanzee/595303/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595084</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A few years ago, Mark Carney, a former Goldman Sachs director who now leads the Bank of England, sounded a warning. Global warming, he said, could send the world economy spiraling into another 2008-like crisis. He called for central banks to act aggressively and immediately to reduce the risk of climate-related catastrophe, taking the warming planet as seriously as they would a cooling economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Adam Tooze, a history professor at Columbia University, knows quite a bit about central banks—and the Great Recession. Last year he published &lt;em&gt;Crashed&lt;/em&gt;, an award-winning account of the 2008 collapse and its aftermath. In that book, he argues that the U.S. Federal Reserve was the pivotal American institution in stopping a second Great Depression. Its actions were “historically unprecedented, spectacular in scale,” he writes, and widely understood by experts to be the “decisive innovation of the crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/20/why-central-banks-need-to-step-up-on-global-warming/"&gt;in an article this month in &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tooze asserts that the Fed needs to battle climate change in the same way. “If the world is to cope with climate change, policymakers will need to pull every lever at their disposal,” he writes. “Faced with this threat, to indulge in the idea that central banks, as key agencies of the state, can limit themselves to worrying about financial stability … is its own form of denial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, would not call himself a climate-change denier. Indeed, he is probably the most powerful person in the American government who affirms climate science. Yet he has taken a subdued approach to mitigating climate change. In April, &lt;a href="http://www.schatz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Chair%20Powell%20to%20Sen.%20Schatz%204.18.19.pdf"&gt;in a letter to Senator Brian Schatz&lt;/a&gt;, Powell wrote that “addressing climate change is a responsibility that Congress has entrusted to other agencies.” The Federal Reserve, he added, is using its tools to “prepare financial institutions for severe weather.” In England, by contrast, Carney has convened 33 central banks to investigate &lt;a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en/financial-stability/international-role/network-greening-financial-system/press-events"&gt;how to “green the financial system.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/jerome-powell-fed-federal-reserve-climate-change-5d70a03e-cad4-4983-8426-f054998b0fae.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, every powerful central bank is working with him—except for Banco do Brasil and the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I talked with Tooze last week about whether climate change could really cause another global crash, how to think about climate policy in history, and what the Fed could do to decarbonize the economy. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robinson Meyer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/20/why-central-banks-need-to-step-up-on-global-warming/"&gt;In your &lt;em&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt;, you draw an analogy between the financial crisis of 2008 and what’s happening now with climate change. You describe a crisis in a near-term future, one where climate change has taken hold but where much of the economy is still tied up in oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I will say: I’m a little skeptical. I’m not sure you could get the kind of sudden financial stop through climate change that you got in 2007 and 2008. What’s the right way to think about that analogy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; That skepticism is perfectly warranted. I’d say that in some sense, I’m here writing with my historian’s hat on, and all I’m really observing is that Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, &lt;a href="https://www.bis.org/review/r151009a.htm"&gt;in 2015, in a speech which has subsequently received massive coverage&lt;/a&gt;—and he is a man, after all, absolutely &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; the global financial establishment—coined the idea of a climate Minsky moment. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/02/04/the-minsky-moment"&gt;A Minsky moment&lt;/a&gt; is when an asset’s price suddenly collapses after a long period of growth.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So the point, to me, is not so much the realism of that prospect, of the fact that we could have some kind of subprimelike scenario. For me, the significant thing is that the argument is actually going on inside the establishment, in the network of financial regulators and central-bank thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Are we likely to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a financial Minsky moment? I think that is a reasonable question mark. We would need [fossil-fuel assets] to be on the balance sheet of actors who were under huge pressure in a fire-sale situation and who couldn’t deal with a sudden revaluation. We would need an entire network of causation to be there, which is what produced the unique crisis of 2007 to 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: What would cause that kind of sudden revaluation? Would there need to be a policy shock, such as the United States suddenly imposing a climate policy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; That would be one way in which this could be sudden. So imagine that we stay on our current path, and we’re headed toward 3 or 4 degrees’ [Celsius] temperature change. And then imagine some of the nonlinearities kick in, which the climate scientists tell us about, and we face a Fukushima-style event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What happens next? You then get nervous democratic politicians—and not necessarily those who are known for their populism, but just nervous democratic politicians—suddenly deciding that we have to stop doing one or another part of our carbon-based economy. It has to stop, and it has to stop immediately. And then you get big shocks. Then you get sudden revaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That, I think, is the sort of scenario that the Bank of England people are working with. In other words, the success of the delaying tactics of the carbon lobby create a situation in which we’re then faced with the possibility of a sudden regulatory shock, something that really inflicts major losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/why-little-ice-age-doesnt-matter/594517/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: No climate event in 2,000 years compares to what’s happening now&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;You quote this astonishing statistic: “One-third of equity and fixed income assets issued in global financial markets can be classified as belonging to the natural resource and extraction sectors, as well as carbon-intensive power utilities, chemicals, construction, and industrial goods firms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Who is in that group? Are those the oil majors such as Exxon, or does that encompass every construction firm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; It isn’t just the oil and gas majors, because they wouldn’t get you to 30 percent. Exxon isn’t big enough to get you to that kind of percentage. It’s Exxon, and [the major automakers] Daimler and BMW, and the entire carbon-exposed complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In Germany right now, there’s a very serious conversation about whether BMW and Daimler are too big to fail. Americans don’t have that sense of a manufacturing industry anymore—except, of course, we did end up bailing out GM in 2008. But Germany is far, far more exposed. A huge slice of their economy is basically all about internal combustion engines, and so that number includes all of those stocks, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;And just to get back to the financial-crisis point, if there were some kind of immediate crunch, and all those stocks tanked …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. If we saw a huge shock to, say, European equity [exchange-traded funds], which were heavily in German automotive, that’s the sort of trigger that we might be looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="441" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/RTX6ZZ4F/dbb7ddf30.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, believes that climate change threatens the global financial system. He spoke with Jerome Powell during a summit in France in July. (Pascal Rossignol / Reuters)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;In your view, what do you see as the goal of climate policy? Is it only to reduce carbon emissions? Do you see any benefits to the economic transition that we scientifically have to make, beyond mitigating climate change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean, that’s been the green-modernization agenda of climate politics, certainly in Europe, since the 1980s, right? This is not simply a zero-sum game; this is a structural transformation that has many very attractive properties. There’s loads of excellent jobs that could be created in this kind of transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There’s no reason why, even by conventional GDP-type metrics, it need even be associated with the kind of feel-bad factor of slow GDP growth. Then [you could] also link it to a revival of social democracy for the United States. From a progressive political point of view, that’s obviously extremely attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whether that will, in fact, ease the formation of majorities in Congress is another question. Because, after all, it does somehow have to get through the Senate, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, well, welcome to the life of a climate-change reporter. You get to talk about lots of ideas and policies, but then it’s all about what will survive the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Exactly. I mean, ever since the 1990s that’s been the logjam on any serious American commitment. So …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;I think part of what I’m asking is: When you look at a third of securities tied up in the carbon economy and the evidence for &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2016/12/08/decoupling-economic-growth-from-emissions-growth/"&gt;decoupling&lt;/a&gt; GDP growth from carbon emissions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X18305831"&gt;maybe not being as strong as we’d like&lt;/a&gt;, do you think the change that needs to happen is realistic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Realistic? No. I mean, depends what you mean by realism. The scale of the challenge requires a boldness of action for which there is no precedent. That’s the only good purpose that the war analogies serve, in my mind. I think in many ways the war-emergency analogy is terribly unhelpful because [climate change] is not that kind of challenge at all really, but at least that gives you some measure of the scale and urgency of what’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario/579700/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Are we living through climate’s worst-case scenario?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: In your piece, you write: “Those in the United States who call for a Green New Deal or a Green Marshall Plan are, if anything, understating the scale of what is needed.” Do you think climate action needs to be larger&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;than, say, the U.S. mobilization for World War II?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, less large in absolute terms. Because even the U.S. was spending almost 40 percent of GDP on World War II. And if you’re the Soviet Union, you’re spending 55 to 60 percent in 1940. We don’t need to do anything like that. It needs to be much bigger than the New Deal, which in fiscal-policy terms was really quite trivial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Crucially, what makes it totally unlike the war is that there’s no happy end. There’s no moment where you win and then everything goes back to the way it was before, but just better. That’s a misunderstanding. This isn’t crash dieting; this is a permanent change in lifestyle, and we need to love that and we need to live it and we need to own it and we need to reconcile ourselves to the fact that this is for us and for all subsequent generations of humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And furthermore—and much more fundamentally than any of those things—this isn’t really about America. I mean, America can be an obstacle and get in the way, but none of the really hard choices needs to be made by America, and all the really hard choices need to be made by people like China and India and Pakistan and Bangladesh and Indonesia. Our choices are all trivially easy, because for all the assets that we’re going to lose, we need to create $5 trillion worth of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;What’s the closest analogy to what needs to happen? Is there a single historical analogy that we could think of—of a broad transition with no happy victory parades at the end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t think I’m uncomfortable with saying that this is unprecedented, so I’m not sure that looking for analogies is all that helpful, to be honest. I don’t write lessons-from-history-type pieces, because I really buy the hockey stick. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The “hockey stick” graph shows &lt;a href="https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/01.html"&gt;that economic growth over the past 300 years&lt;/a&gt; has been unprecedented compared with human history before it.] In other words, we have never had to fundamentally rethink the energy basis of our way of life. I mean, we never have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;Industrialization has only happened once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Exactly. And furthermore, it has turned out to be exponential—a hockey-stick-style process. So no, it’s not obvious to me that [analogies are] a terribly helpful way of thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It strikes me, perhaps, as an indication of the poverty of our democratic imagination right now that we go backwards so much. One of the striking things about the American left is its nostalgia. There’s always some moment that you can handily pick up, a lesson you can learn from the New Deal. Or if not the New Deal, then the Progressive era. Or if not from the Progressive era, then the Homestead Strike. Like there’s some heritage of struggle that you want to draw on. And that backwards move is—even among the smartest, smartest people on the American left—is a compulsion, almost. It seems to me, in some sense, a mirror image of the strange practice of originalist interpretation of the Constitution. The sheer fact of the continuity of the American political argument, back to the founding, sucks people into this line of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;You don’t have that very much in Germany. There isn’t anyone in Germany saying, “Which bit of mid-20th-century history is this most like?&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;mercifully. The one analogy that has popped up in Germany is reunification, which I actually think is quite a good one, because that’s still an ongoing problem. So in the American case, it would be civil rights and Reconstruction, which isn’t a particularly optimistic comparison to draw. It’s an ongoing problem, it’s a deep historic problem, it only happened once, we still haven’t fixed it, and we’re not at peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a kind of shallow view of climate change: that it is something we need to avert or stop. And that’s somewhat true. But there’s also a deeper view: that climate change is the situation within which all other politics will happen for the next several generations, at least. That like Reconstruction or the civil-rights movement, it needs to be something that people take on like a moral commitment, in the same way they take on genocide prevention as a moral commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not sure quite why you go to moral commitment here. I can see the attraction of that. But I would take a more functionalist line. Like, morals aside, mass incarceration, the destruction of the lives of millions of African American men—it is clearly a moral issue. But that isn’t, to me, the thing which should give it urgency. The crisis that African American men suffer in the United States is extraordinarily acute and oppresses them every single day of their lives, from cradle to grave. Anyway, this is the point where I think this analogy becomes problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;I do like your point that this is a forever problem—at least for all conceivable futures—like working through that problem of racism and the legacies of slavery is a forever problem in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;And there’s a degree to which it also increases the functional load on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. Because problems that we thought we’d fixed, like the Green Revolution and the feeding of the world population, for instance—totally not obvious that those fixes cope with the next 20 years of what’s ahead of us. The food problem that was such an oppressive issue globally in the 1970s may resurge in an absolutely dramatic way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/green-new-deal-economic-principles/582943/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: A centuries-old idea could revolutionize climate policy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;Given all that, if Jerome Powell decided that he wanted to intervene on the side of climate action, what could he do? What could the Fed do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; What I think the Fed should announce is that it enthusiastically supports the idea of a bipartisan infrastructure push focused on the American electrical network, first and foremost, so that we can actually hook up the renewable-generating capacity—which is now eminently, you know, realistic in economic terms. Setting a backstop to a a fiscal-side-led investment push is the obvious thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;So basically it should say: If the government were to issue a bunch of new debt to fund green investment and no one was buying it, then the Fed would?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze: &lt;/strong&gt;And there isn’t the slightest evidence [it wouldn’t sell], because the U.S. Treasury is issuing unprecedented quantities of debt right here and right now. But the Fed would view [the issue of new debt tied to infrastructure] as in no way alarming. It is indeed a highly appropriate response to an environment of extremely low interest rates, and [former Treasury Secretary] Larry Summers &amp;amp; Co. would argue that it might help, as it were, to suck us out of the state of secular stagnation that we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Then you could get into the technicalities of thinking how the Fed addresses issues of finance and green bonds. That would be another avenue to go down—for the Fed to take a role in helping develop a classification of green bonds, of green financing, with a view also to rolling out comprehensive demands for disclosure on the part of American firms, for climate risks to be fully declared on balance sheets, and for due recognition to be given to firms that are in the business of proactively preparing themselves for decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer: &lt;/strong&gt;One idea that you mention in particular is that if there were some kind of green bond, it would count in some greater way against the amount of capital that banks are required to hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, exactly. Where it would really matter is that the Fed could work to modify &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp"&gt;Dodd-Frank regulation&lt;/a&gt; in such a way as to be supportive of that kind of lending, and the Fed could proactively work through &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basel_accord.asp"&gt;the Basel process&lt;/a&gt; [which governs international bank rules] to make changes at the global level. You could, for instance, declare that the Fed views with disfavor the role of several large American banks in continuing to fund coal investment. Some of the carbon-tracking NGOs have done very good work showing and exposing the way in which some of the largest, the most reputable American banks are still in the business of lending to Big Coal. Banking regulation could be tweaked in a way that would produce a tilt against that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer:&lt;/strong&gt; Has the Fed ever done something like this before? Where it’s said, “We need to move the economy in this direction, so we’re going to treat certain asset classes favorably?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, this idea of neutrality comes up: &lt;em&gt;Isn’t the Fed supposed to be neutral?&lt;/em&gt; It’s an attractive idea, and goes along with the idea of Fed independence—except it’s completely ahistorical. I mean, the classic role of the Fed is to support government-issued debt. Insofar as the Green New Deal is a government-issued business, the Fed has just an absolutely historical warrant for supporting fiscal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It hasn’t historically done that—and there’ve been moments where the Fed acted as a goad, notably in the early stages of the Clinton administration. But with regards to the broader economy, the entire federal-government apparatus essentially stood behind the spread of home ownership in the United States and the promotion of suburbanization through the credit system. And kind of what we need is a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer&lt;/strong&gt;: But without the crisis at the end of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became vehicles for truly toxic modes of leverage and intermediation. But if the question is, Is there historical warrant for the financial agencies of government in the United States biasing the property structure in the economy in a certain way?, the answer is emphatically yes—all the way down to the grotesque role of the New Deal financial apparatus in enshrining the racial segregation of the American urban space, with massive effects from the 1930s onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The idea of neutrality should not even be allowed in the room in this argument. It’s a question of where we want to be biased. If you look at QE, especially in the U.K. and the EU, it was effectively fossil-biased. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp"&gt;Quantitative easing&lt;/a&gt;, or QE, is when central banks buy stocks and bonds to boost the economy.] The assets that were bought as part of the asset-purchasing program had heavy carbon contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That’s not surprising: The bonds of the European energy majors have very high ratings, and so they tend to be part of the process of asset purchases. So in the same way as QE is believed to have an effect on inequality through the way in which it drives asset-market prices, it also underwrites the existing biases of the financial system toward fossil fuels. So monetary policy is not neutral with regards to the environment. There’s no safe space here. The only question is whether you’re going to lead in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meyer:&lt;/strong&gt; Last question. With any of this, is there a role for interested Americans to play if they are not particularly tied to the financial- or monetary-policy elite?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooze&lt;/strong&gt;: Support your congressperson in doing exactly what AOC did in the hearings with Powell a couple of weeks ago. [&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Powell &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-10/ocasio-cortez-trump-adviser-unite-to-trash-the-phillips-curve"&gt;whether inflation and unemployment are still closely connected&lt;/a&gt;, as the Fed has long argued.] Applaud, follow with interest, raise questions. That’s exactly what needs to be happening. The politicization of monetary policy is a fact. I mean, I write these pieces because I personally think this is eminently suitable for political conversation. If we don’t raise these questions, the de facto politics is, more often than not, conservative and status quo–oriented. So this, like any other area, is one where citizens—whether they’re educated and informed or not—need to wise up, get involved, and follow the arguments and develop positions. So applaud your congresspeople when they do exactly what AOC was doing in that situation. In many ways, I thought it was one of the most hopeful scenes I’ve seen in that kind of hearing in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTS2LUEE/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Leah Millis / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has promised to finish his term even if President Donald Trump demands his resignation.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">How Climate Change Could Trigger the Next Global Financial Crisis</title><published>2019-08-01T10:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T14:44:33-04:00</updated><summary type="html">The Federal Reserve should act aggressively to reduce that risk, a leading economic historian argues.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/how-fed-could-fight-climate-change-adam-tooze/595084/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595276</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How should Democrats even debate climate policy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a harder question than it may seem. Climate change is a sprawling, scary, cinematic problem, and its remedies involve the less-than-inspiring technical undergirding of society: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/why-cities-flood/538251/?utm_source=feed"&gt;stormwater management&lt;/a&gt;, the electrical grid, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-winning-climate-strategy/576514/?utm_source=feed"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;. And dirt management will never be as engrossing as, say, Medicare for All. The party may also benefit, in a sort of shallow but undeniable way, from its monopoly on climate concern. Since any Democrat would do more to fight climate change than the current president, what’s the point of airing dirty laundry about it in public?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have all put out highly similar visions on climate,” South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said on Tuesday night. “We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are lots of reasons to talk about it. Debates can inform the public about vital issues, as much as about the candidates, and on this topic, the Democrats running for president have real disagreements. This primary has taught them how to talk about those disputes in a way that is accessible, useful, and urgent. (And Buttigieg’s claim that they share “highly similar visions” on climate, for instance, is more than a little self-serving: His campaign has been less specific about its own climate plans.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest fissure last night had former Vice President Joe Biden on one side and Washington Governor Jay Inslee on the other. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/bidens-climate-plan-mini-green-new-deal/591046/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Biden’s climate proposal&lt;/a&gt; aims for a “100 percent clean-energy economy” by 2050. It asks Congress to spend $1.7 trillion on new climate-friendly programs. Inslee’s plan, by contrast, requires &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/jay-insles-climate-plan-keeping-it-100/588652/?utm_source=feed"&gt;most of the economy to go 100 percent clean by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, and it calls for &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/6/24/18715163/jay-inslee-climate-plan-phase-out-fossil-fuels"&gt;$9 trillion in investment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/controversial-study-asks-do-renewable-energy-standards-work/588823/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Do renewable-energy standards work?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to have a bold plan. And mine has been called the gold standard,” Inslee said last night. (Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, specifically, called his plan the gold standard.) “Middle-ground solutions like the vice president has proposed or sort of average-sized things are not going to save us. Too little, too late is too dangerous,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden, who has proposed a legitimately ambitious climate policy, seemed thrown. The United States is responsible for only 15 percent of global carbon emissions, he said. For the other 85 percent, the world needs something that “I helped negotiate … the Paris climate accord.” He promised to “rejoin that accord, and I would make sure we up the ante. I would be able to bring those leaders together that I know and convene them in the White House, and I would raise the standard.” His plan would also spend $400 billion on clean-energy R&amp;amp;D and build half a million charging stations for electric cars by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the candidates onstage then sided with Inslee. “I have to agree with Governor Inslee,” Senator Kamala Harris said at the start of her answer. She then quoted a line from his stump speech. A few minutes later, Senator Cory Booker made the same move. “I want to take a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee,” he said. “Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords. That is kindergarten.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booker then argued that every aspect of the U.S. government, from its trade deals to its economic policies, must center on climate change. (Inslee has already proposed plans advancing similar ideas.) “The majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we’re going to deal with this is if the United States leads,” Booker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/democrats-try-to-resurrect-the-paris-agreement/585982/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Democrats try to resurrect the Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pursuing ambitious climate policy would have repercussions, and across the two evenings of debate, one of the clearest disagreements was about the right status for the fossil-fuel industry. Inslee argues that the oil and gas industry is the primary obstacle to taking climate action. Any attempt to reduce carbon emissions, he says, must address Big Oil’s power head-on. Siding with him most clearly are Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Sanders went even further than Inslee on the first night of the debates. “What do you do with an industry that knowingly—for billions of dollars of short-term profits—is destroying this planet?” asked the senator from Vermont. “I say that is criminal activity. That cannot be allowed to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone was won over by that antagonism. Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, warned that demonizing fossil-fuel companies could also demonize their employees. John Hickenlooper, Colorado’s governor, was skittish too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden, meanwhile, seems like he’s trying to split the difference.

Almost all of them were terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The important number in this is 15 percent of global emissions,” Yang began, referring to the U.S. share of overall carbon pollution. “We like to act as if we’re 100 percent. Even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the Earth is going to get warmer. The last four years have been the four warmest years in history. We are too late. We are 10 years too late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Okay, let’s stop there. Yang is correct about a number of facts here. The United States does emit about 15 percent of the world’s carbon pollution. Even if the U.S. cut emissions now, the world would keep getting warmer. (That would be true even if the entire world cut carbon emissions, by the way—the thing about filling the atmosphere with &lt;em&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/em&gt; is that they will keep mindlessly capturing heat until they are absorbed or dissolve.) Yang is also right that some climate change is already baked in: The planet has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/how-climate-change-could-remake-every-biome-on-earth/569038/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: No ecosystem on Earth is safe from climate change&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang sees those facts, collectively, as a condemnation. “We are too late,” he intones. “We are 10 years too late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;With some due respect: What the hell? Yang has taken several nominally true sentences and strung them together into a dangerous argument. Sure, we’re too late to avoid some amount of climate change taking hold. We will need to adapt to climate change—and frankly, few leaders talk enough about adaptation. (Several candidates onstage last night, including Washington Governor Jay Inslee and former Vice President Joe Biden, have adaptation plans.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the game is not &lt;em&gt;lost. &lt;/em&gt;The planet could still follow a range of emission outcomes, including a not very bad one and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario/579700/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a catastrophic worst-case scenario&lt;/a&gt;. The worst, fastest sea-level rise seems like it may kick in between two and three degrees Celsius—and extraordinary action could yet hold that off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nor is the United States’ 15 percent share of global emissions reason for despair. First of all, the U.S. is the second-largest producer of carbon emissions. Second, there is a good response available to America’s emissions—and Yang, a former tech worker, should know it. The United States must develop decarbonization technologies here that can be sold or transferred to the rest of the world. That is why so many candidates stress the importance of R&amp;amp;D and why Inslee and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have talked about green manufacturing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was not the end of Yang’s argument. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction,” he continued, “but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground—and the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/climate-change-damaging-american-democracy/573769/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Climate change is already damaging American democracy&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe I’m overreacting. Maybe Yang is just very good at staying on message. He is, after all, referring to his signature proposal, a universal basic income that would assure every American $1,000 a month. And, like, … sure … I guess. It is true—it is &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; true—that people who have more money will be less vulnerable to any one disaster. And people who are facing disaster should have more money. Protection from vulnerability is basically &lt;em&gt;what wealth is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But handing out money is not an adaptation policy. And $1,000 a month is not a good response to losing your house to higher sea levels, which is the malady Yang seems to be implying. It is certainly not &lt;em&gt;a collective adaptive approach to the challenge of climate change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Think about it this way. Asked about climate change on national television, Yang said that climate change is an inexorable problem, that the U.S. can’t do much of anything about it, and that if the seas take your house—that is, if a problem outside your control deprives you of your most expensive asset—then the government shouldn’t do anything specifically to help you. That is quite an argument. It does not strike me as one well chosen for a party whose voters care about climate change and who are moving to the left.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_1158920676/lead_960.mpo"><media:credit>Jim Watson / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Andrew Yang made a surprisingly conservative argument about climate adaptation.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Andrew Yang Is Not Your Climate Friend</title><published>2019-08-01T00:05:19-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T09:14:22-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Fleeing to “higher ground” isn’t an adaptation policy.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/andrew-yangs-horrific-debate-answer-climate-change/595267/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595114</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists believed that babies encounter microbes for the very first time when they are born. Both a healthy womb and the placenta that nourishes the growing fetus, they said, are sterile. If bacteria do sneak in, they’re intruders and bad news for the fetus. But in 2014, Kjersti Aagaard from Baylor College of Medicine challenged that dogma. In placental tissue samples from 320 women, she found DNA from &lt;a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/237/237ra65.abstract"&gt;many kinds of bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which made up a “unique placental microbiome,” she argued. Aagaard suggested that this microbiome is part of natural pregnancy and might seed a fetus’s body with microbes in utero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The placenta is not teeming with bacteria, but we can find them,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/health/study-sees-bigger-role-for-placenta-in-newborns-health.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “and we can find them without looking too hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More placental-microbiome studies have since been published. Aagaard’s team and others have looked at how this community of microbes &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03066-4"&gt;varies with body weight&lt;/a&gt;, how it affects the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730116/"&gt;placenta itself&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s linked to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592210/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937816003057"&gt;preterm birth&lt;/a&gt;, and whether it’s a “&lt;a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(19)30614-3/fulltext"&gt;missing link&lt;/a&gt;” between gum disease and pregnancy problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other microbiologists &lt;a href="https://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2014/05/overselling-microbiome-award-many-for.html"&gt;were dubious from the start&lt;/a&gt;. Many species reported in these studies are easy to grow in labs, they noted, so why had microbiologists largely failed to culture microbes from placentas for decades? And how could fetuses control such microbes when their immune systems are undeveloped? While writing a book about microbiomes, I asked many researchers if there were any discoveries to be wary of, and the most common answer was the placental microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/the-plot-holes-in-the-human-microbiome-story/486947/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Don’t stress about your baby’s microbiome just yet&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skeptics argued that the bacterial DNA most likely came from microbes living in the wider world, which had contaminated the equipment or the samples used in those earlier studies. &lt;a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(18)30900-1/pdf"&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29776928"&gt; studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-018-0575-4"&gt; that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0172-3"&gt; specifically&lt;/a&gt; tried to account for such contaminants found no evidence of a placental microbiome. Maybe it’s not a missing link at all. Maybe it’s just plain missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team at the University of Cambridge has weighed in with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1451-5"&gt;one of the most comprehensive studies&lt;/a&gt; to date, involving placental tissue from more than 500 women. The researchers found no evidence of a consistent community of microbes that live in healthy placentas. The few signs of bacterial DNA they detected came either from contaminants or from harmful microbes that only rarely infect placentas. “We spent a very long time thinking about how to remove and identify every source of contamination,” says Julian Parkhill, one of the study’s leaders. “When we did that, we realized there was nothing left.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study, in my view, settles the matter,” says &lt;a href="https://www.arrietalab.com/"&gt;Marie-Claire Arrieta&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Calgary, who wasn’t involved. It’s a reminder that DNA data “can be easily misinterpreted,” she adds, and that “misinterpretations can become quite widespread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2512"&gt;Marloes Dekker&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Queensland, who &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03066-4"&gt;published a small placental-microbiome study in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, says the Cambridge study is bigger, more extensive, and did a better job of accounting for contamination. “It could certainly change the interpretation of our results,” she says. “I am not convinced of the existence of a true placental microbiota.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aagaard, meanwhile, stands by her work. She argues that the Cambridge researchers used techniques that would be unlikely to detect actual placental microbes, and that they filtered what they &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;find too strictly. She also points to other recent studies where researchers also found bacterial DNA in placental tissue, or managed to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18313635"&gt;culture living microbes&lt;/a&gt;. Parkhill and his colleagues “are not recognizing, or are naive to, other evidence for colonization,” she says. “We can’t just brush this off and say this is sloppy science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/a-grand-unified-theory-of-unhealthy-microbiomes/537945/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: A grand unified theory of unhealthy microbiomes&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkhill argues that Aagaard and others are underestimating the issue of contamination—a problem that extends well beyond the placenta. When scientists want to find microbes in a tissue sample, they use a set of chemicals to pull out any DNA, amplify it, and prepare it for sequencing. But these “extraction kits” &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2014/11/11/contaminomics-why-some-microbiome-studies-may-be-wrong/"&gt;almost always have traces of microbial DNA in them, too&lt;/a&gt;! Even if you use them on a tube of pure water, you’ll find bacterial DNA. That doesn’t matter when looking at organs like the gut, whose extensive communities of microbes overwhelm the faint signals from contaminants. But it very much matters when looking at places where microbes are rare or absent—like the placenta. There’s a huge risk that whatever you find comes from &lt;em&gt;kits,&lt;/em&gt; not tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problem, jokingly known as the “kit-ome,” has led to many spurious discoveries. Bacteria that thrive on sunlight, or that can’t grow at body temperature, have been identified &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37344"&gt;in the human brain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Bradyrhizobium&lt;/em&gt;, which lives on plant roots, has been found in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1211115#t=articleBackground"&gt;many body parts&lt;/a&gt;. Another &lt;a href="https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Listeria_welshimeri"&gt;plant-associated species&lt;/a&gt; that’s incapable of infecting human cells was identified in &lt;a href="https://aem.asm.org/content/80/10/3007"&gt;breast tissue&lt;/a&gt; (of Irish women, but not Canadians). These examples &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0202-y"&gt;have been compared&lt;/a&gt; to finding “blue whales in the Himalayas or African elephants in Antarctica.” They’re becoming more common, because the newfound popularity of the microbiome field, combined with the growing ease of sequencing techniques, attracts researchers who are unaware of “how ubiquitous contamination is,” Parkhill says. “A lot of people will just go and grab a technique off the shelf without realizing the subtleties and pitfalls.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team went out of the way to address these issues. When analyzing their 537 placental samples, the researchers also used extraction kits on blank samples to see which contaminants were there. They used two different kits on several samples and sequenced the extracted DNA with two different techniques, cross-referencing all the results. They even spiked their samples with a minuscule amount of the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Salmonella bongori&lt;/em&gt; to check that they &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;detect rare microbes that were actually present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked for odd patterns. For example, they found &lt;em&gt;Bradyrhizobium&lt;/em&gt; in some batches of samples that had been processed together but not in others—a sure sign that it came from the kits, not the placentas. (It showed up in the blank samples too.) Two other bacterial species matched strains that had been analyzed in a completely different study using the same sequencing machines; their DNA had almost certainly stowed away &lt;em&gt;on the machines&lt;/em&gt;, and got into the placental samples. The team also detected DNA from vaginal bacteria, but rarely, in tiny amounts, and more often from vaginally delivered placentas than those delivered through C-sections. It’s unlikely that such microbes are regularly colonizing the placenta; either they contaminated the tissues during labor, or they represent rare infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/social-networks-but-for-microbes/424317/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How your social life changes your microbiome&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the team only found convincing evidence for one species in the placental samples, and even then in just 5 percent of the samples, and at very low levels. It’s called &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae &lt;/em&gt;(pronounced ay-guh-lack-tee-ay)—a potential pathogen that can pass from mother to infant during birth and cause neonatal sepsis. “This doesn’t conflict with the dogma that the womb is microbe-free in healthy pregnancies, because this bacterium is associated with disease,” writes &lt;a href="http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/"&gt;Nicola Segata&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Trento &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-02262-8"&gt;in a related commentary&lt;/a&gt;. “This finding provides strong evidence that there is no functional microbiota in the placenta.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://reproductivesciences.wustl.edu/laboratories/mysorekar-lab/"&gt;Indira Mysorekar&lt;/a&gt; from Washington University in St. Louis notes that the team only took samples from a region of fingerlike structures called the terminal villi, which transfer nutrients from the mother’s bloodstream into the fetus’s. “That area is not expected to have the bacteria, and there really hasn’t been much controversy about whether there is a microbiome there,” Mysorekar says. When other studies found placental microbes, they looked at &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11514-4"&gt;different parts of the organ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aagaard adds that the Cambridge team used techniques that would minimize the odds of finding resident microbes, from washing samples in saline to using sequencing protocols that are unlikely to find bacteria in low abundances. She also says that the team too readily billed microbes as vaginal contaminants, even when they were seen in placentas that had been delivered through C-sections. “They’ve subtracted out stuff that in my mind doesn’t make a lot of sense to subtract out,” Aagaard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the end, any one of those things we have decided are contaminants could actually be” in the placenta, Parkhill says. “It comes down to judgment, and a balance of probabilities. Do we throw away decades of biological understanding of the sterility of the placenta, or do we take this very weak and sporadic signal, which [could be] due to contamination, and claim that it’s real?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, new evidence has changed his mind. “If you’d asked me 10 years ago, I would have told you that the lung is sterile,” he says. “That’s not the case now. There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a community there.” Other tissues are more controversial: Claims about a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/do-gut-bacteria-make-second-home-our-brains"&gt;brain microbiome&lt;/a&gt; have been met with skepticism, and Parkhill says that “a lot of the signals I see in brain-microbiota papers are clearly contamination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to prove a negative, of course, but for the placenta at least, scientists have come close: For decades, they’ve successfully bred sterile mice by removing the uterus of a pregnant female, bathing it in sterilizing chemicals, cutting the pup out in sterile conditions, and raising it in a sterile environment. If placenta microbes exist, and pass from mother to fetus, this technique should be impossible. It plainly isn’t. “It is a bit startling that we are having a debate given that the ultimate experiment for sterility in the womb has been performed repeatedly, and routinely, for more than half a century,” says &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Perez-Munoz"&gt;Maria Elisa Perez-Muñoz&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Alberta. (Aagaard counters that this is an extreme procedure that would likely remove any resident prenatal microbes; “It’s awfully darn-tooting hard to make a germ-free animal,” she says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mysorekar feels that the technical side of this debate obscures more interesting questions. Like: If the placenta is sterile, &lt;em&gt;how does that happen&lt;/em&gt;? If the fetus develops in a microbiological vacuum for nine months, why doesn’t it go into immunological shock when it’s suddenly exposed to millions of bacteria at birth? Why do fetuses seem to have activated immune cells, which usually only activate on exposure to bacterial molecules? “It makes biological sense that there’s some [prenatal] exposure,” she says, and if not through the placenta, then “where and how is that happening?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s often said that academic fights are so vicious because &lt;a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/08/18/acad-politics/"&gt;the stakes are so low&lt;/a&gt;, but the dispute over the placental microbiome is more than just a niche academic squabble. As I’ve written about before, entire fields of science have been built upon &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/waste-1000-studies/589684/?utm_source=feed"&gt;shaky, nonexistent foundations&lt;/a&gt;, to the waste of effort, careers, and taxpayer money. If the human-microbiome field is to avoid making these mistakes, it needs to wrestle with exactly these questions over which methods to use and how data should be interpreted. Despite ballooning popularity, hype, and financial support, it is still a science in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ed Yong</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/c/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Whitetherock Photo / Shutterstock</media:credit><media:description>Scientists have been undecided about whether a fetus is exposed to microbes inside the womb.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">Why the Placental Microbiome Should Be a Cautionary Tale</title><published>2019-07-31T13:02:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T15:46:32-04:00</updated><summary type="html">A new study suggests that evidence for microbes found on placentas was the result of lab contamination.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/placental-microbiome-should-be-cautionary-tale/595114/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-595048</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After the victims were found dead—“decapitated” and “breasts opened”—the residents of a beachside community in Mandurah, Australia, took matters into their own hands. Five locals, along with Claire Greenwell, a biologist at Murdoch University, arranged an overnight stakeout. Another neighbor lent them a mobile home, so they could take turns sleeping at the scene. The target of all this drama? A cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a cat who had taken to killing in Mandurah’s bird sanctuary. Mandurah &lt;a href="https://www.mandurah.wa.gov.au/whats-on/news/2018/09/27/23/41/fairy-terns-back"&gt;had recently fenced off nesting grounds&lt;/a&gt; to attract a vulnerable and cartoonishly adorable native seabird called the fairy tern. Fairy terns don’t usually nest near people, but to &lt;a href="https://www.mandurah.wa.gov.au/whats-on/news/2018/09/27/23/41/fairy-terns-back"&gt;the city’s great pride and joy&lt;/a&gt;, they did start having chicks in Mandurah. It was a success story—until it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Over the course of a few weeks, the cat managed to almost singlehandedly drive off the entire nesting colony of 220 birds, according to a study from Greenwell and her colleagues in the journal &lt;em&gt;Animals&lt;/em&gt;. The cat was directly or indirectly responsible for the death of six adults and 40 chicks. Once it became clear the sanctuary was no longer safe, the entire colony abandoned the site. The nesting sanctuary was ultimately a failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="532" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Hungry_/5d6c4b80e.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;A fairy tern feeding a chick (Claire Greenwell)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The first sign of something amiss came on the night of November 18, 2018, when residents heard a commotion among the fairy terns. A white cat was chased out of the sanctuary. In the days and weeks after, Greenwell started finding dead birds—or really, parts of dead birds. Other birds went missing. The death of an eight-day-old chick, the first to hatch in the entire nesting colony, hit Greenwell particularly hard. “Every single day, I watched that chick grow,” she says. “The parents were looking for it. They wouldn’t leave the nest, because they were waiting for the chick to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, residents saw a cat prowling in the area again. It was white. Over the next few days, as birds kept dying or disappearing, wildlife cameras confirmed the presence of the white cat. A resident even snapped a photo from an apartment balcony, in which the cat appeared to be in the sanctuary eating something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/cat-psychopaths/583192/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Why we think cats are psychopaths&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That’s when they decided on the stakeout. On the night of December 1, Greenwell and the five residents took shifts. The white cat came at 7 p.m.; they shooed it away. The cat returned at midnight; they shooed it away again. The cat came back a third time that night, and Greenwall saw it slinking toward the birds. They chased the cat for half a mile before it disappeared in the coastal scrub. The group returned to stake out the area the next night, and then the City of Mandurah hired an overnight security guard for a few days. When the cat was not seen again, they thought the danger had passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But it had not. The cat returned, and more dead birds turned up. What’s more, Greenwell observed, the adults stopped spending time on the ground caring for the chicks. They also stopped working together to drive off raptors hunting for chicks, which adult fairy terns normally do by flying around and above the nests in a big group. The birds seemed to have given up on protecting their chicks. “The colony basically just fell apart,” she says. By mid-December, the colony had left, and all the chicks were dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;(During this period, two other cats, both identified as pets, were also trapped at or near the site, though there’s no evidence either hunted birds. The fairy tern deaths continued after these cats were removed, too. No other cats were caught on camera or seen by residents at the time.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There was absolute outrage in the community,” Greenwell says. The residents had become so invested in the fairy terns that one of them was waking up in the middle of the night to check on the birds. In July, the city council moved forward on a &lt;a href="https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/6290650/mandurah-council-moves-to-strengthen-cat-ownership-laws/"&gt;law cracking down on cat ownership&lt;/a&gt;. The law would require a permit for more than two cats, prohibit cats from certain nature reserves, and fine owners $200 not following permit rules or for letting their cats cause a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this comes at a time when the Australian government is attempting to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/magazine/australia-cat-killing.html"&gt;cull 2 million feral cats&lt;/a&gt;—through trapping, shooting, and even dropping poisoned sausages. In Australia, these measures are meant to help save native species. The continent’s birds, mammals, and reptiles evolved over millions of years without cats, leaving them especially vulnerable to feline predation. “Cats have been a driving factor in the extinction of most of the 34 mammals that have gone extinct in Australia,” says &lt;a href="https://riel.cdu.edu.au/people/profile/prof-john-woinarski"&gt;John Woinarski&lt;/a&gt;, a conservation biologist with the Threatened Species Recovery Hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In Mandurah, the white, male cat was finally captured on December 12 and, according to local news reports, &lt;a href="https://www.mandurahmail.com.au/story/5834987/mandurah-endangered-bird-killings-sparks-call-for-feral-cat-pest-listing/#slide=4"&gt;euthanized by the City&lt;/a&gt;. The cat was not microchipped or collared, but it had been neutered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/does-my-cat-want-me-lick-her-back/594988/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: An offbeat approach to bonding with cats&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the U.S., where &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/magazine/australia-cat-killing.html"&gt;pro-cat groups have gained more purchase&lt;/a&gt; than in Australia, cat advocates promote an &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/cats-and-birds-2013-6/"&gt;intensely controversial policy of trap-neuter-return&lt;/a&gt; (TNR), in which neutered cats are released back outdoors. Cat advocates tout trap-neuter-release as the humane way to reduce feral and stray feline populations over time. Bird advocates say &lt;a href="https://abcbirds.org/program/cats-indoors/trap-neuter-release/"&gt;the policy doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt;, because TNR programs often aren’t able to spay or neuter enough of the cats. In any case, neutered cats, once returned, are killing wildlife, Greenwell says. In Australia, the country has decided its native wildlife is more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Of course, not every single cat is as destructive as the white cat in Mandurah. “Cats can be quite idiosyncratic,” Woinarski says. Some are excellent hunters. Others not so much. &lt;a href="http://wichitaferal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Predation-impacts-by-a-single-feral-cat-in-a-Cuban-rural-farm.pdf"&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2007.00153.x"&gt;in the world&lt;/a&gt;, people have also reported a single cat having a huge and disproportionate impact on a group of birds. And cats certainly do sometimes kill more prey than they eat. A study of stray cats on Jekyll Island, off the coast of Georgia, found that they ate just &lt;a href="https://bioone.org/journals/Wildlife-Research/volume-45/issue-4/WR17155/The-use-of-point-of-view-cameras-Kittycams-to-quantify/10.1071/WR17155.short"&gt;83 percent of what they killed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="333" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/cat_woodrat_mouth/824a4c9a6.png" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;A cat with a woodrat in its mouth in the Florida Keys (Michael Cove)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The abandonment of the fairy tern nesting site also demonstrates how the impact of cats ripples far beyond the birds that they directly kill. “Whether they’re actually killing or not, they can incite fear in these small prey populations,” says &lt;a href="https://mvcove.wixsite.com/wildliferesearch"&gt;Michael Cove&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist with North Carolina State University. Scientists call this the “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/nothing-to-fear-except-fear-itself-wolves-and-bears/470532/?utm_source=feed"&gt;landscape of fear&lt;/a&gt;.” In the Florida Keys, for example, where Cove has studied free-ranging cats, he thinks endangered &lt;a href="https://www.fws.gov/verobeach/MSRPPDFs/KeyLargoWoodrat.pdf"&gt;Key Largo woodrats&lt;/a&gt; have been building fewer of &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334695380_Towards_recovery_of_an_endangered_island_endemic_Distributional_and_behavioral_responses_of_Key_Largo_woodrats_associated_with_exotic_predator_removal"&gt;their characteristic nests out of large sticks&lt;/a&gt;. “If you’re a small rodent carrying this big, cumbersome stick,” Cove says, “that makes it pretty obvious, almost advertising yourself in the world. You can imagine that you become easy prey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The very presence of cats—or perhaps even a single cat—is enough to change an ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sarah Zhang</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sarah-zhang/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/The_white_cat_1-1/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Courtesy of L.

It happened among the not-so-killer B’s: the moderates Steve Bullock, Beto O’Rourke, and Pete Buttigieg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullock, the governor of Montana, began by addressing Senator Bernie Sanders, asking, “Are we going to actually address climate change? … Or are we going to give people a better shot at a better life?” Bullock then added: “You can do both.” (This insight did not come as a surprise to Sanders, no matter what you think of his politics. The Vermont senator has endorsed the Green New Deal, which deliberately ties climate policy to several allegedly life-bettering policies, including universal health care and a job guarantee.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Bullock attempted to &lt;em&gt;depoliticize&lt;/em&gt; climate change: to make it a purely technical issue best left to professionals. “Let’s actually have the scientists drive this,” he said. “Let’s not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we can’t even get a Republican to acknowledge that the climate is changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/trumps-always-shifting-views-on-climate-change/573037/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trump slightly revises his views on climate change&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullock is likely correct on the second point: Republicans in Washington, at least, aren’t likely to do anything on climate change soon. But he is wrong to suggest that scientists will solve it. Scientists can only study climate change; they can’t solve it. Engineers, technologists, and energy-system designers will solve it, if anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that’s too nitpicky a point, and Bullock isn’t alone among progressives in leaning too hard on the prized status of science. But climate change will be fought in part by &lt;em&gt;building &lt;/em&gt;stuff: new train lines, a new power grid, wind turbines, and solar farms. And as any local zoning-board official will tell you, the construction&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of something new is always unavoidably, inherently political.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderators then called on O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, who replied to this point in a somewhat garbled way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I listen to scientists on this, and they are very clear. We don’t have more than 10 years to get this right,” he said, before pivoting: “And we won’t meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country. We’ve got to bring everyone in.” Then he listed a number of archetypes of Americans—Texans and residents of Flint, Michigan, and college students in New Mexico—who needed to be brought into the climate solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this wasn’t his point—and it wasn’t much of a point in the first place—but Beto seemed to suggest that the scientists can tell us only the scale of the climate problem. They can’t actually marshal resources to address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/do-most-americans-believe-climate-change-polls-say-yes/580957/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, echoed Bullock’s point that virtually any Democrat will do more for the climate than the current president. “We have all put out highly similar visions on climate,” Buttigieg said. (I would dispute this, for what it’s worth: Senator Michael Bennet &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24062019/election-2020-climate-change-presidential-debate-questions-candidate-profiles"&gt;has a more detailed plan than Buttigieg does right now&lt;/a&gt;.) “It is all theoretical. We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Buttigieg, who so often cites his young age (and exposure to climate risk) as a major reason for his candidacy, started talking about Trump’s alleged bone spurs. For all the lip service that some politicians pay to climate change, lots of them just don’t know that much about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTX71M6Y_toned/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Lucas Jackson / Reuters</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Climate Change Can’t Be Left to the Scientists</title><published>2019-07-31T06:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T06:36:39-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Steve Bullock just wasn’t right.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/bullock-beto-and-buttigiegs-fight-climate-change/595144/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594946</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 1861, the American scientist and educator William Barton Rogers published a manifesto calling for a new kind of research institution. Recognizing the “daily increasing proofs of the happy influence of scientific culture on the industry and the civilization of the nations,” and the growing importance of what he called “Industrial Arts,” he proposed a new organization dedicated to practical knowledge. He named it the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rogers was one of a number of late-19th-century reformers who saw that the United States’ ability to generate progress could be substantially improved. These reformers looked to the successes of the German university models overseas and realized that a combination of focused professorial research and teaching could be a powerful engine for advance in research. Over the course of several decades, the group—Rogers, Charles Eliot, Henry Tappan, George Hale, John D. Rockefeller, and others—founded and restructured many of what are now America’s best universities, including Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Caltech, Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago, and more. By acting on their understanding, they engaged in a kind of conscious “progress engineering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Progress itself is understudied. By “progress,” we mean the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries. For a number of reasons, there is no broad-based intellectual movement focused on understanding the dynamics of progress, or targeting the deeper goal of speeding it up. We believe that it deserves a dedicated field of study. We suggest inaugurating the discipline of “Progress Studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Before digging into what Progress Studies would entail, it’s worth noting that we still need a lot of progress. We haven’t yet cured all diseases; we don’t yet know how to solve climate change; we’re still a very long way from enabling most of the world’s population to live as comfortably as the wealthiest people do today; we don’t yet understand how best to predict or mitigate all kinds of natural disasters; we aren’t yet able to travel as cheaply and quickly as we’d like; we could be far better than we are at educating young people. The list of opportunities for improvement is still extremely long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/innovations-list/309536/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The 50 greatest breakthroughs since the wheel&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Those are major challenges. A lot of progress can also come from smaller advances: Thousands of lesser improvements that together build upon one another can together represent an enormous advance for society. For example, if our discoveries and inventions improve standards of living by 1 percent a year, children will by adulthood be 35 percent better off than their parents. If they improve livelihoods at 3 percent a year, those same children will grow up to be about 2.5 times better off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whether viewed in terms of large or small improvements, progress matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Looking backwards, it’s striking how unevenly distributed progress has been in the past. In antiquity, the ancient Greeks were discoverers of everything from the arch bridge to the spherical earth. By 1100, the successful pursuit of new knowledge was probably most concentrated in parts of China and the Middle East. Along the cultural dimension, the artists of Renaissance Florence enriched the heritage of all humankind, and in the process created the masterworks that are still the lifeblood of the local economy. The late 18th and early 19th century saw a burst of progress in Northern England, with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. In each case, the discoveries that came to elevate standards of living for everyone arose in comparatively tiny geographic pockets of innovative effort. Present-day instances include places like Silicon Valley in software and Switzerland’s Basel region in life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These kinds of examples show that there &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be ecosystems that are better at generating progress than others, perhaps by orders of magnitude. But what do they have in common? Just how productive can a cultural ecosystem be? Why did Silicon Valley happen in California rather than Japan or Boston? Why was early-20th-century science in Germany and Central Europe so strong? Can we deliberately engineer the conditions most hospitable to this kind of advancement or effectively tweak the systems that surround us today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is exactly what Progress Studies would investigate. It would consider the problem as broadly as possible. It would study the successful people, organizations, institutions, policies, and cultures that have arisen to date, and it would attempt to concoct policies and prescriptions that would help improve our ability to generate useful progress in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/the-industrial-revolution-and-its-discontents/379781/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Is ‘progress’ good for humanity?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, the world would benefit from an organized effort to understand how we should identify and train brilliant young people, how the most effective small groups exchange and share ideas, which incentives should exist for all sorts of participants in innovative ecosystems (including scientists, entrepreneurs, managers, and engineers), how much different organizations differ in productivity (and the drivers of those differences), how scientists should be selected and funded, and many other related issues besides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of existing scholarship touches on these topics, but it takes place in a highly fragmented fashion and fails to directly confront some of the most important practical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to know how to most effectively select and train the most talented students. While this is an important challenge facing educators, policy makers, and philanthropists, knowledge about how best to do so is dispersed across a very long list of different fields. Psychometrics literature investigates which tests predict success. Sociologists consider how networks are used to find talent. Anthropologists investigate how talent depends on circumstances, and a historiometric literature studies clusters of artistic creativity. There’s a lively debate about when and whether “10,000 hours of practice” are required for truly excellent performance. The education literature studies talent-search programs such as the Center for Talented Youth. Personality psychologists investigate the extent to which openness or conscientiousness affect earnings. More recently, there’s work in sportometrics, looking at which numerical variables predict athletic success. In economics, Raj Chetty and his co-authors have examined the backgrounds and communities liable to best encourage innovators. Thinkers in these disciplines don’t necessarily attend the same conferences, publish in the same journals, or work together to solve shared problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When we consider other major determinants of progress, we see insufficient engagement with the central questions. For example, there’s a growing body of evidence suggesting that management practices determine a great deal of the difference in performance between organizations. One recent study found that a particular intervention—teaching better management practices to firms in Italy—improved productivity by 49 percent over 15 years when compared with peer firms that didn’t receive the training. How widely does this apply, and can it be repeated? Economists have been learning that firm productivity commonly varies within a given sector by &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.49.2.326"&gt;a factor of two or three&lt;/a&gt;, which implies that a priority in management science and organizational psychology should be understanding the drivers of these differences. In a related vein, we’re coming to appreciate more and more that organizations with higher levels of trust can delegate authority more effectively, thereby boosting their responsiveness and ability to handle problems. Organizations as varied as Y Combinator, MIT’s Radiation Lab, and ARPA have astonishing track records in catalyzing progress far beyond their confines. While research exists on all of these fronts, we’re underinvesting considerably. These examples collectively indicate that one of our highest priorities should be figuring out interventions that increase the efficacy, productivity, and innovative capacity of human organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Similarly, while science generates much of our prosperity, scientists and researchers themselves do not sufficiently obsess over how it should be organized. In a recent paper, Pierre Azoulay and co-authors &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w15466"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; that Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s long-term grants to high-potential scientists made those scientists 96 percent more likely to produce breakthrough work. If this finding is borne out, it suggests that present funding mechanisms are likely to be far from optimal, in part because they do not focus enough on research autonomy and risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/why-small-science-still-matters/582685/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Small teams of scientists have fresher ideas&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More broadly, demographics and institutional momentum have caused enormous but invisible changes in the way we support science. For example, the National Institutes of Health (the largest science-funding body in the U.S.) reports that, in 1980, it gave 12 times more funding to early-career scientists (under 40) than it did to later-career scientists (over 50). Today, that has flipped: Five times more money now goes to scientists of age 50 or older. Is this skew toward funding older scientists an improvement? If not, how should science funding be allocated? We might also wonder: Do prizes matter? Or fellowships, or sabbaticals? Should other countries organize their scientific bodies along the lines of those in the U.S. or pursue deliberate variation? Despite the importance of the issues, critical evaluation of how science is practiced and funded is in short supply, for perhaps unsurprising reasons. Doing so would be an important part of Progress Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress Studies has antecedents, both within fields and institutions. The economics of innovation is a critical topic and should assume a much larger place within economics. The Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University seeks to encourage optimistic thinking about the future through fiction and narrative: It observes, almost certainly correctly, that imagination and ambition themselves play a large role. Graham Allison and Niall Ferguson have called for an “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/09/dont-know-much-about-history/492746/?utm_source=feed"&gt;applied history&lt;/a&gt;” movement, to better draw lessons from history and apply them to real-world problems, including through the advising of political leaders. Ideas and institutions like these could be more effective if part of an explicit, broader movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a world with Progress Studies, academic departments and degree programs would not necessarily have to be reorganized. That’s probably going to be costly and time-consuming. Instead, a new focus on progress would be more comparable to a school of thought that would prompt a decentralized shift in priorities among academics, philanthropists, and funding agencies. Over time, we’d like to see communities, journals, and conferences devoted to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Such shifts have occurred before. A lot of excellent climate-science research—in environmental science, physics, chemistry, oceanography, mathematics and modeling, computer science, biology, ecology, and other fields—was being pursued before we recognized “climate science” as a discipline unto itself. Similarly, the designation of “Keynesian economics” helped economists focus on fiscal policy as a tool for recession fighting, just as the name “monetarism” created a focal interest in questions surrounding the money supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An important distinction between our proposed Progress Studies and a lot of existing scholarship is that mere comprehension is not the goal. When anthropologists look at scientists, they’re trying to understand the species. But when viewed through the lens of Progress Studies, the implicit question is how scientists (or funders or evaluators of scientists) &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be acting. The success of Progress Studies will come from its ability to identify effective progress-increasing interventions and the extent to which they are adopted by universities, funding agencies, philanthropists, entrepreneurs, policy makers, and other institutions. In that sense, Progress Studies is closer to medicine than biology: The goal is to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt;, not merely to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We know that, to some readers, the word &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt; may sound too normative. However, it is the explicit bedrock upon which Vannevar Bush made his case for postwar funding of science, a case that led to the establishment of the National Science Foundation. In an era where funding for good projects can be hard to come by, or is even endangered, we must affirmatively make the case for the study of how to improve human well-being. This possibility is a fundamental reason why the American public is interested in supporting the pursuit of knowledge, and rightly so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If we look to history, the organization of intellectual fields, as generally recognized realms of effort and funding, has mattered a great deal. Areas of study have expanded greatly since the early European universities were formed to advance theological thinking. Organized study of philosophy and the natural sciences later spawned deeper examination of—to name a few—mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and economics. Each discipline, in turn with its subfields, has spawned many subsequent transformative discoveries. Our point, quite simply, is that this process has yet to reach a natural end, and that a more focused, explicit study of progress itself should be one of the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Patrick Collison</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/patrick-collison/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><author><name>Tyler Cowen</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/tyler-cowen/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_3252888/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Harry Todd / Hulton Archive / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">We Need a New Science of Progress</title><published>2019-07-30T13:33:41-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-30T17:24:26-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Humanity needs to get better at knowing how to get better.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594988</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever wanted to lick your cat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is not my question—I can guess the answer—but it’s the one blaring from the packaging of the &lt;a href="https://pdxpetdesign.com/licki/"&gt;Licki&lt;/a&gt;, in all caps. Lest anyone believe the query is rhetorical, the box provides an answer: “NOW YOU CAN. WITHOUT THE FURBALLS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although I’ve never felt such an urge, I do own a Licki. I ordered it from Amazon nearly a year ago, on a dare from a colleague. As soon as it came, I opened the otherwise ordinary envelope to find a silicone freak of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most of the Licki consists of a stiff, four-inch “tongue” section covered with 22 one-inch spikes, like the cleats on old-school baseball shoes. It’s attached to a mouthpiece, which resembles the big, chunky mouth guards that hang from football players’ face masks. The tongue comes in one color: a garish, fleshy pink-red. In case there is any doubt about its purpose, the slogan “LICK YOUR CAT” is printed four different times on the box and also on the mouthpiece, right where your upper lip goes, as if to remind you why you’re about to put this ridiculous object in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once the Licki arrived, I set it aside, for I had never truly wanted to LICK [MY] CAT and I was bashful about being so easily bullied into buying it. But one evening in late April, my cat, Nellie, was gnawing on my laptop screen and headbutting my hands as I tried to type, and I decided the time had come. As it gets warm in the spring, Nellie sheds a lot of hair. While she loves being scratched—she’s almost doglike in her affection, and doesn’t mind being touched on her belly or other places where cats can be sensitive—she’s hated every brush that I’ve ever tried to use on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/cat-domination/530685/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How cats used humans to conquer the world&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Licki promises a more “intimate” grooming experience with your pet, “much like a mama cat bonds with her young.” According to its manufacturer, “Cats groom each other as a form of social bonding ... Yet as a human, you’re left out of their intimate licking ritual. At best you have a one-sided licking relationship with your cat.” On the one hand, that kind of bonding sounded appealing, and like it might skirt Nellie’s hatred of brushes, as well as provide some entertainment for my wife. On the other hand, I was nervous about getting clawed or bitten as I jabbed a large, spiked silicone tongue at my cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Nellie was initially, and understandably, wary. She sniffed at the Licki as I attempted to lick her. But after a few minutes, she settled in, curled up, closed her eyes, and began purring loudly. She was happy to be licked on her back and tail and head. We got Nellie from a shelter when she was about six months old, and we don’t know what her earliest months were like or whether she had much time with a mother. I hesitate to apply armchair Freudian analysis to my cat, but she seemed mothered as I licked her. I tried the Licki a few more times to make sure it wasn’t a fluke, but she seemed to like it every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The experience was, however, not as pleasant for the licker. After holding on to the mouthpiece for a few minutes, my jaw started to ache from clenching it and my mouth watered uncomfortably. I ended up with a lot of hair in my nose and eyes. It’s tough to find a good posture to lick the cat in a way that’s comfortable for both her and the user for more than a couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Any individual Licki user’s experience is likely to vary as much as her cat’s temperament. The reviews on Amazon run the gamut from sardonic (“I use this to chase cats away from my yard, or rather, the owners of said cats know not to let their cats loose in our neighborhood unattended.”) to suggestive (“Awesome! My wife loves when I use this.”) to sincere (“Kinda weird, but my cat loves it!”). There are stories about people being clawed or bitten, and lots of gag-gift purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some are heartbreaking. “I put up with a lot from people making fun of it and me for being excited about it. I didn't care who laughed if it made my babies happy ... I SO MUCH wanted my cats to love it! I would show everyone who laughed!” writes one verified buyer. “It just traumatized the animals.” Another claims to lick his cat sans Licki—I have questions!—but even he found it awkward to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These unhappy results do not come as a great surprise to cat experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There is a lot of lore surrounding cat behavior, in part because scientific explorations of cat behavior, especially social behavior, have been limited,” Monique Udell, the director of the &lt;a href="https://thehumananimalbond.com/"&gt;Human-Animal Interaction Lab&lt;/a&gt; at Oregon State University, wrote me in an email. “While reciprocal grooming may be an important feature of feline social behavior in some contexts, it would be a leap to suggest that cats require the same form of interaction from their human partners to establish strong bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/cat-psychopaths/583192/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Why we think cats are psychopaths&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And even between cats, it’s complicated. &lt;a href="http://catsandsquirrels.com/aboutme/"&gt;Mikel Maria Delgado&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher on cat behavior at the University of California at Davis, told me that, though cats do bond by grooming one another, a 1998 study found that nearly a third of cat-on-cat grooming ends up in “agonistic behavior.” In other words: Even from another trusted feline, a cat’s tolerance for being licked is limited, and whoever is doing the licking is in line for a possible snarl or swipe or scratch. Licki is “encouraging a lot of things that are intimidating to cats,” Delgado said, such as hovering over them or placing one’s face near them. “I think it’s a terrible idea for the human.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Your meowage may vary, but I figured I couldn’t argue with results. As long as Nellie liked the Licki, I was inclined to at least occasionally deal with the discomfort of using it. My wife, once she finished laughing at me, suggested that I just hold the Licki and use it to groom the cat. This felt like a betrayal of all the Licki represents. I brandished the Licki at her, with its slogan splayed across the mouthpiece, and demanded, “Does this say ‘BRUSH YOUR CAT’?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Nonetheless, I eventually gave in to necessity and neck pain, and Nellie seemed just as pleased and mothered when I held the Licki as when it was in my mouth. It turns out that the Licki can be an effective bonding tool, and it doesn’t even require any licking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David A.

He had barely started his job when she was found in 1981—strangled and hidden inside a water cistern in rural Ohio. She was so badly decomposed as to be unrecognizable. For 38 years, Nenni kept coming back to Belle, as he referred to her, even as the sheriff’s-office investigators who worked the case retired one by one, even as he himself officially retired. This year, something finally came of his efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This morning, the coroner’s office announced the real name of the Belle in the Well: Louise Virginia Peterson Flesher, born on June 16, 1915, in West Virginia. She was finally identified through her DNA and genealogy by a nonprofit, the DNA Doe Project, that Nenni had contacted about the case. The nonprofit’s volunteers used the same technique &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/golden-state-killer-east-area-rapist-dna-genealogy/559070/?utm_source=feed"&gt;that led to the arrest of the Golden State Killer suspect&lt;/a&gt; last spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But Nenni’s quest to identify the nameless woman through DNA and genealogy began long before the Golden State Killer case popularized the idea. Back in 2014, he proposed the strategy to Elizabeth Murray, a forensic anthropologist, who put Belle’s case into the &lt;a href="https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/6259/details"&gt;National Missing and Identified Persons System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2014, the market for mail-in DNA kits like those from Ancestry and 23andMe was much smaller. The technology was much simpler, too. Genealogists interested in DNA were usually looking only at the tiny subset of a person’s DNA that could be easily analyzed at the time: the Y chromosome, which is always passed from father to son, or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is always passed from mother to child. The Belle in the Well was a woman, so she didn’t have a Y chromosome, but she did have mtDNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This gave Nenni an idea. He uploaded Belle’s mtDNA to a public database maintained at the time by Ancestry and got 50 to 60 matches. He messaged them all, hoping that their family history or lore might hold a clue that would lead him to Belle’s identity. But the problem with mtDNA is that people who share a great-great-great-great-grandmother might have all the same mtDNA markers—but be so distantly related that they have little information to share. No one who responded to Nenni knew of a missing person in their family. Most people did not respond at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Very quickly, Nenni hit a wall. He realized that to actually trace enough relatives to ID her using genealogy, he needed to do more advanced analysis of autosomal DNA, which contains far more genetic information than the Y chromosome or mtDNA. (Autosomal DNA refers to the 22 pairs of chromosomes other than X and Y.) For this, Ancestry required saliva—a large amount of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At one point, I had delusions,” Nenni says. “If I could get ahold of Belle’s DNA, I’m gonna put it in some distilled water in one of Ancestry’s test kits and send it to them and not say anything about it.” He never did do that. The company took its mtDNA database offline in 2014 as part of the industry’s shift to autosomal DNA, and Ancestry’s $99 tests today are based on autosomal DNA. Ancestry has been reluctant to work with police, and &lt;a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Transparency-Report"&gt;it has not allowed law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; to search its current autosomal-DNA database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It was not until 2017, when Murray, Nenni’s collaborator, met a forensic genealogist named Colleen Fitzpatrick at a conference, that the team saw a way forward again. That same year, Fitzpatrick and Margaret Press, a hobbyist genealogist and crime writer, had co-founded a nonprofit called the &lt;a href="http://dnadoeproject.org/"&gt;DNA Doe Project&lt;/a&gt; to identify John and Jane Does. They were looking for pilot cases. The Belle in the Well became one of the first four cases for the fledgling nonprofit in June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA Doe Project has since solved 12 Doe cases, but Belle’s case was the hardest and took the longest, at 14 months. “This case is a big deal for us,” Press says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Press personally spent sleepless nights researching the Belle in the Well. When I visited her home in Sebastopol, California, last summer, she pulled out a stack of hand-drawn family trees for the unidentified woman. The case was so difficult because of endogamy, or the practice of marrying within a community. Belle’s ancestors in West Virginia, which is just across the river from Ohio, where she was found, appeared to all be related to one another in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Instead of a family tree with branches, you have a bowl of spaghetti,” says Lee Bingham Redgrave, a DNA Doe volunteer who, along with her husband, Anthony Lukas Redgrave, ultimately led the case. When the team got Belle’s DNA back from a lab, they uploaded the file to a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/gedmatch-police-genealogy-database/561695/?utm_source=feed"&gt;website called GEDmatch&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to upload raw DNA profiles from several companies, including 23andMe and Ancestry. Belle had more than 180 matches who were cousins to varying degrees, but none was closer than a third cousin. To figure out how all these cousin matches connected to her, the volunteer team looked at which small segments of DNA they shared and narrowed down possible relationships based on family records from obituaries, birth and marriage certificates, and the census. Belle’s family trees ultimately included 43,130 people total. Her real name, the volunteers figured, was somewhere in those trees. But they could not figure out which strand of spaghetti to disentangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One detail stood out, though. Belle’s mother and father did not appear to be related. “One of her parents was from somewhere else, maybe a foreign country,” Fitzpatrick said at a press conference. In January, someone in Canada with German ancestry took a DNA test and uploaded their profile to GEDmatch. That person was a distant relative to Belle. When the Redgraves started going through that person’s family, they found a German man who had immigrated to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“All of a sudden, there was a name we had looked at 1,000 times from Belle’s tree, and we knew it immediately,” Lee Redgrave told me. “I grabbed Anthony’s leg and shouted the last name.” The name they recognized turned out to be Belle’s mother, who was married to the German immigrant. The woman who is Belle—Louise Virginia Peterson, married name Flesher—had actually been one of the 43,130 people in the volunteers’ family trees for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Redgraves eventually found a yearbook seller on eBay selling the very 1934 edition in which Flesher would have appeared. Her high-school-yearbook  photo resembled the facial reconstructions that police had released over the years. The volunteers were convinced they had the right person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the ultimate proof still came in the form of DNA. The volunteers found that Flesher had had daughters, and Nenni got in touch with one of them for a swab. It came back a mother-daughter match. Nenni says the two women were estranged but declined to elaborate, as the daughter wishes to remain anonymous. It would explain why Flesher could have disappeared without anyone alerting the police. By complete coincidence, Anthony Redgrave, whose father is from West Virginia, is a distant relative of Flesher; based on how much DNA they share, they’re probably sixth cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the success with the Belle in the Well and &lt;a href="https://parabon-nanolabs.com/news-events/2019/03/parabon-helps-investigators-solve-1000-years-of-cold-cases-in-9-months.html"&gt;arrests in dozens of other cases&lt;/a&gt; through forensic genealogy, the field has been going through a bit of a crisis. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/27/us/genetic-genealogy-gedmatch-privacy/index.html?fbclid=IwAR15saQBgUz1k688520XyEf67zeoFMFSl-w-QWnqC_MeCmOua5gY_a1Bcpo"&gt;In June,&lt;/a&gt; after the volunteers found Flesher but before the DNA confirmation with her daughter, GEDmatch made it much harder for law enforcement to search its database, following backlash to a Utah case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;GEDmatch had previously told users that the site would be used only for homicides and sexual assaults. The Utah case was an assault, but GEDmatch still allowed investigators to use the database. For some genealogists, the episode underscored just how little oversight exists for such a powerful technique. (A study from October found that most Americans with European ancestry can be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/golden-state-killer-genealogy/572545/?utm_source=feed"&gt;identified through a relative’s DNA&lt;/a&gt; in genealogy databases the size of GEDmatch.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In response to backlash over the Utah case, GEDmatch decided to opt every user out of law-enforcement searching by default, and only a small fraction of users have since actively opted back in. Press says the case of the Belle in the Well would not have been solved under the new policy. None of her closer matches, including the final cousin in Canada, has opted in. The recent questions raised about privacy and GEDmatch echo the concerns that Nenni encountered when trying to work with Ancestry years ago. These issues are still unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Louise Virginia Peterson Flesher at least, Nenni hopes that people who knew her might come forward with information about her death now that her identity is known. Investigators do not know who killed her or how she ended up in the water cistern. It is still an open homicide investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sarah Zhang</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sarah-zhang/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/janedoe/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Courtesy of the Lawrence County Coroner's Office / The Atlantic</media:credit><media:description>Louise Peterson is the name of a woman in Ohio who was unidentified for 38 years.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">She Was Found Strangled in a Well, and Now She Has a Name</title><published>2019-07-29T13:20:59-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-01T08:56:52-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Using DNA, genealogists finally confirmed the identity of the “Belle in the Well,” found 38 years ago.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/belle-well-dna/594976/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594964</id><content type="html">&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/brain-eating-amoeba-death.html"&gt;a North Carolina man&lt;/a&gt; became a notorious microbial killer’s first &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/rare-brain-infection-death-linked-swim-cumberland-county-lake"&gt;confirmed victim&lt;/a&gt; this year. Fifty-nine-year-old Eddie Gray had unknowingly come across a brain-eating amoeba while swimming in a man-made lake near Fayetteville in mid-July; 10 days later, he was dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since the brain-eating amoeba was first &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/path.1711000402"&gt;recognized and named&lt;/a&gt;, in 1970, grisly reports of its disastrous attacks have made headlines &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/63715-naegleria-fowleri-brain-eating-amoeba-surf-resort.html"&gt;nearly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/virginia-health-officials-report-case-of-brain-eating-amoeba"&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/arizona-teen-becomes-sixth-victim-this-year-of-brain-eating-amoeba"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;. About 97 percent of confirmed cases in the United States have been fatal. But the infection is also incredibly rare, and the small sample size leaves the epidemiologists who study it and the doctors who encounter it with their hands tied. It may be one of nature’s most perfect crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite their gruesome moniker, most brain-eating amoebas never eat a single brain. The single-celled swimmer, formally known as &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;, passes its time resting in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/freelivingamebic/index.html"&gt;dormant state&lt;/a&gt; or, when it’s warm enough, splashing around and munching on bacteria. Unlike most waterborne pathogens, it’s utterly benign if you drink it. It becomes dangerous only when, thanks to a person enjoying a day at a water park or a quick rinse in a stream, the amoeba is yanked from its bacterial buffet and swept into the dark recesses of the human nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If the amoeba isn’t already in dining mode at this point, the intense burst of human body heat can help it shape-shift out of dormancy. Like anyone else waking up somewhere unfamiliar, the brain-eating amoeba is desperate for a food source, so it slithers its way up the olfactory nerve until it spies a tasty-looking tangle of neurons and digs in. The host’s immune system, sensing an unwelcome visitor, sends an onslaught of white blood cells to take down the feasting parasite. That commotion leads to a swollen—and, eventually, irreparably damaged—brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/giant-medusavirus-hosts-turn-to-stone/585289/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Beware the Medusavirus&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We have these hard skulls to protect our brains from traumatic injuries,” says Jennifer Cope, a medical epidemiologist who studies &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “But when you start to swell, that hard skull actually gets in the way.” With nowhere else to go, the brain stem and other nearby regions are pushed down through the bottom of the skull. For most of the brain-eating amoeba’s victims, this crowding is the direct cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Altogether, this deadly infection is known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). It’s &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s15010-016-0878-y"&gt;similar to&lt;/a&gt; viral and bacterial meningitis, except the invader that causes it comes from the water and eats your brain. With just about 30 cases in the United States in the past decade, PAM is an uncommon variant of an already rare disease. Since &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; was first identified by Australian doctors roughly 50 years ago, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/illness.html"&gt;at least 146&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases of PAM in the United States, with only four survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; is so alarmingly dangerous because, like bacterial and viral meningitis, PAM is nearly impossible to spot until long after any of the interventions that have &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2135236/we-may-have-cure-brain-eating-amoeba"&gt;worked for some victims&lt;/a&gt; are even an option. Even when a patient does make it to a hospital within a few days of infection, PAM is often mistaken for one of these types of meningitis (distinguishing them requires an invasive spinal tap) and treated as such, to no avail. Experts agree that for every confirmed case, there are likely one or two that were misdiagnosed and recorded instead as more common meningitis fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gray’s death fits the most common narrative of an &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; fatality. Though not much is known about the organism, Cope says, “we do know it’s thermophilic—it likes heat.” Swimmers in balmy southern lakes and rivers have generally been the unlucky few each summer, but in recent years there have been some concerning outliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2013, a 4-year-old boy living near New Orleans died unexpectedly from what doctors later determined to be PAM. The CDC was called. “I asked the same questions we usually do about swimming in lakes, and [the parents] said they hadn’t been to any lakes,” Cope says. “It led to us finding that really the only thing was that he’d been playing on the backyard Slip ’n Slide—with a hose hooked up to the backyard tap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Two years earlier, a 20-year-old man in the same parish had developed PAM after rinsing his sinuses &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/04/will-my-neti-pot-kill-me/524358/?utm_source=feed"&gt;with a neti pot&lt;/a&gt; he’d filled up in the sink. “We went back and we did sampling again,” Cope says. “This time we found it in the home where the patient had been exposed, but we also found it in the drinking-water distribution system, in the pipes that led into the home from the street.” It was the first time the amoeba had been spotted in a centrally treated U.S. system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/04/will-my-neti-pot-kill-me/524358/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Is my neti pot going to kill me?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“What the problem was in Louisiana was that they were using chloramines,” says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.arizona.edu/directory/charles-gerba"&gt;Charles Gerba&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona who studies &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10040-017-1582-4"&gt;groundwater &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In Arizona, Gerba says, chlorine is the standard choice for disinfecting municipal water, but about &lt;a href="http://www.waterrf.org/resources/webcasts/Lists/PublicWebcasts/Attachments/67/091516_FINALv1.pdf"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the country instead uses chloramine, a mix of chlorine and ammonia that leaves behind fewer harmful by-products &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/safewater/chlorination-byproducts.html"&gt;such as chloroform&lt;/a&gt;. Chlorine and chloramine dissipate differently in water, meaning that under the right set of circumstances—for instance, low water turnover in areas left partially vacant by Hurricane Katrina—the less aggressive chloramine can leave some pockets untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The contaminated system in Louisiana was flushed in 2013, and the Environmental Protection Agency began regularly monitoring water &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/14/brain-eating-amoeba-found-in-louisiana-drinking-water-again/"&gt;in the region&lt;/a&gt;. But the process is complicated, and spotting the amoebas can take weeks once they show up. There’s no quick test for the parasite, in part because so much about it remains unknown. Cope’s lab is currently in the early stages of sequencing the genomes of &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; samples that the CDC has collected from across the United States over the years. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100007/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/jmm/65/9/885_jmm000303.pdf?expires=1564365314&amp;amp;id=id&amp;amp;accname=guest&amp;amp;checksum=BDCB75ABECDE6DF2BCC19D6F6218853E"&gt;three genotypes&lt;/a&gt; so far, she says, but the system “doesn’t have a lot of granularity to it” and isn’t used much yet. Its goal is to eventually develop a sort of amoeba dictionary detailed enough to match samples from patients to specific collections of the creatures, giving scientists the ability to pinpoint exactly where someone encountered the pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today the clearest risk factor is still warm water temperatures, which make it easier for the microbes to reproduce. “What’s concerning people,” Gerba says, “is that with global warming, the water is warming up, and people are expecting to see more cases.” Brain-eating amoebas around the world are generally relegated to sunny climes, but when two PAM cases were confirmed in Minnesota in 2010 and 2012, it raised the specter of a climate-change-induced &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; explosion. In a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100007/"&gt;2017 review,&lt;/a&gt; Cope and her colleagues at the CDC warned that the Minnesota cases could be a preview of things to come.

Four of them are still alive. No one has been back since, and it’s unclear when anyone might return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The four moonwalkers were in their mid to late thirties when they flew millions of miles to visit Earth’s celestial companion. Today, in their 80s, their hair is the color of the lunar surface. They remain in the public eye, giving talks and interviews, especially now, as the historic Apollo missions begin &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary/?utm_source=feed"&gt;marking their 50th anniversaries&lt;/a&gt;. But someday the moonwalkers will leave us, taking with them the living memory of a transcendent experience the rest of us can hardly fathom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the youngest generations, the idea of the moon landings, captured in crackly black-and-white footage, might seem as distant as the moon itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;The moon was a weird place to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aldrin, now 89 years old, felt disoriented as he took in the sight. “On the Earth when one looks at the horizon, it appears flat; on the moon, so much smaller than the Earth and quite without high terrain, the horizon in all directions visibly curved away from us,” he wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Return-Earth-Edwin-Aldrin/dp/0394488326/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0"&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt; in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks to the airless environment and the lunar soil, as fine as talcum powder, the astronauts never had to worry about getting lost. “Everywhere you walk, you left your footprints,” said Charlie Duke, who visited in 1972, at an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m9G1s8X_lE"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; last year. “You just turn around and follow your tracks back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;David Scott, who became the first person to drive on another world in 1971, likened the undisturbed landscape to a picture by the photographer Ansel Adams. “There was no color, but great contrast between the brightly illuminated surface and the black shadow of the mountain slopes and craters where no sunlight fell,” he wrote in a 2004 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Sides-Moon-David-Scott/dp/0743231627"&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt;. And the smell! “The moon turned out to have a slightly metallic smell, almost like gunpowder, which pervaded the [lunar module] for the remainder of our trip,” Scott recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These experiences and others are well documented—in grainy footage and scratchy audio, flight transcripts, books, documentaries, Hollywood films, and countless news reports and interviews. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB-H1xXIA0Q"&gt;wonderful little clip&lt;/a&gt; of Jack Schmitt, one of the four remaining moonwalkers, pleading with Mission Control to let him throw his hammer into the lunar sky before getting into the lander to go home. Schmitt, 84 years old now, is the first and only scientist—a geologist—to have visited the moon, and it must have seemed appropriate to leave behind his profession’s tool of choice. “Look at that!” he exclaimed after the flight directors assented and the hammer tumbled, end over end, a small white smudge moving in an arc over the hulking gray background. Schmitt had spent a total of 22 hours outside the capsule, helping to produce the biggest haul of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/lunar-samples-apollo-nasa/594625/?utm_source=feed"&gt;lunar samples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-moon-landing-transcripts/594451/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The best banter from Apollo 11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But these records are not as evocative as hearing from the moonwalkers themselves, says Charlie Bolden, a former space-shuttle astronaut who served as NASA administrator in the Obama administration. When the last moonwalker dies, “it will be like the day we lose the last veteran of World War II—and we’re perilously close to that day—or the last Korean War veteran,” Bolden says. “You will lose any semblance of opportunity to listen to people and hear their firsthand experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bolden had that chance in 1980, as a new NASA recruit from the Marine Corps. The Apollo astronauts would stop by the NASA astronaut office in Houston once a year for their annual physical exams and reminisce with the newbies. Alan Bean, the Apollo moonwalker who died last year at age 86, was a mentor to Bolden’s class during training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Here’s a guy who had walked on the moon, who gave up a year of his life when he could be doing all other kinds of things, to shepherd around these snotty-nosed kids who aspired to be astronauts,” Bolden says. “You know how you see the day-school caregivers walking around with the kids on a rope? That’s kind of the way it felt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Apollo astronauts’ memories of the surface are easier to preserve than the distinct cognitive experience of looking back at the Earth. Some astronauts who travel into Earth’s orbit say they come home with a distinct shift of perspective on the planet. From up there, this ball of swirling blues and whites, suspended in the inky blackness of space, looks fragile, especially against the perilous backdrop of climate change. The effect would only be magnified on the moon, where Earth appears like a gleaming marble. “We have seen it from space as whole and bright and beautiful; we have seen it from the surface of the moon as not very large and somehow vulnerable,” Aldrin wrote in his book. “With all its imperfections, it is a great place to come from and an even greater place to go back to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="672" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Moonwalkers2/3300a14ce.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Joan Wong; Photo courtesy of Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;The Apollo astronauts who had touched the surface of the moon were walking testaments to human achievement. They seemed to ooze unalloyed inspiration. When you ask people to consider the morbid, hypothetical reality of a world without them, most often you hear about that inspiration—and how depressing it would be to lose it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/15/us/moon-landing-fast-facts/index.html"&gt;600 million people&lt;/a&gt; around the world watched Aldrin and Neil Armstrong &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/most-compelling-photo-moon-landing/594274/?utm_source=feed"&gt;descend that ladder&lt;/a&gt; on live television. Pamela Melroy, a former shuttle astronaut who helped assemble the International Space Station, was among them, a 7-year-old girl on vacation with her family on the Jersey shore. “We all watched &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; together—let’s put it that way—so we were all kind of nerdy anyway,” Melroy says. “I don’t remember what I thought at the moment, but I do know that within two years, I had made the decision that I wanted to be an astronaut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Melroy says she dreads the day the last Apollo moonwalker dies. “I sure as heck hope that we will have somebody who has walked on the moon since before the last one passes away,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Richard Nixon correctly predicted in 1972, as the crew of the last lunar mission flew home, that “this may be the last time in this century that men will walk on the moon.” But after pulling off the feat—six times in three and a half years, at that—it seemed hard to imagine the possibility that no one would ever return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-moon-landing-site-today/594364/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What is the Apollo 11 landing site like now? &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The current White House has &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/trump-and-nasas-uncertain-moon-plans/593986/?utm_source=feed"&gt;instructed&lt;/a&gt; NASA to send a crewed mission to the lunar surface in 2024 and has asked Congress for the extra money to pay for it. The effort is not guaranteed, and the roadblocks are numerous, ranging from technical risks to political shifts, and another country may beat it there. The next crew, should it ever arrive, probably won’t resemble the astronauts of the Apollo era, who were white men with similar educational and military backgrounds. The Trump administration says NASA’s new Artemis program, named for Apollo’s sister in Greek mythology, will deliver &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/manned-spaceflight-nasa/594835/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the first woman&lt;/a&gt; to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bolden hopes the crew includes people of color and astronauts from other nations too. He watched the first moon landing in Mississippi, where he was in jet training for the Marine Corps. He was mesmerized, but the event didn’t inspire him to become an astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I’d grown up in the segregated South,” Bolden says. “Becoming an astronaut was not something in the list of things that a young black kid from South Carolina did, in my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He applied to the NASA astronaut corps a decade later, at the urging of Ron McNair, a member of NASA’s 1978 class of astronauts, the first new group since the Apollo program. McNair was the second African American man to fly to space. He died in the Challenger disaster six years after Bolden got the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I needed to see somebody like me,” Bolden says now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the past few rounds of astronaut applications, prospective candidates cited the space-shuttle missions, not the moon landings, as motivation, according to those who reviewed them. This year, Millennials will surpass Baby Boomers as the largest adult population in the United States, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/"&gt;an analysis of government data&lt;/a&gt; by the Pew Research Center. The Apollo program was not the defining moment of space exploration for members of this generation, born from 1981 to 1996. They remember their teachers wheeling bulky televisions into classrooms to watch a space-shuttle launch or tuning into livestreams on their laptops to watch a SpaceX rocket fly. They summon images of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos more readily than of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;When the Apollo 11 astronauts returned to Earth, they were unlike any other travelers in history. But they still had to follow the rules governing entry to the United States, which explains the existence of perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/7044-moon-apollo-astronauts-customs.html"&gt;the most ridiculous copy of a customs entry form on record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Where the form requested a departure location, NASA wrote “moon.” The cargo was “moon rock and moon dust samples.” As for whether the travelers experienced any conditions on board that could lead to the spread of disease, NASA wrote, “to be determined.” Scientists and doctors had no idea what the lunar environment could do to the human body, so Armstrong, Aldrin, and Michael Collins spent a month in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The document is delightful and silly, but it marked a shift in a millennia-old perception of the flat orb of light in the night sky. It made clear to travelers who would never leave Earth that the moon was a real place, somewhere people could truly &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt;. Not only that, but &lt;em&gt;they could do things there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/most-compelling-photo-moon-landing/594274/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The most compelling photo of the moon landing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some scientists thought the surface would be soft, and the astronauts would sink, but it held them well, and the dust clung to their spacesuits and drove them nearly crazy trying to wipe it off. The astronauts scaled the gentle slopes and went for a drive. They enjoyed a quiet, freeze-dried meal, slipped into their sleeping bags, and pulled the shades down in their capsule to soften the radiant sunlight bouncing off the Earth. And when they left, their footprints remained, preserved in the unmoving regolith for &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-moon-landing-site-today/594364/?utm_source=feed"&gt;tens of thousands of years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Apollo astronauts made a home on another world. For a brief moment, humankind extended beyond the boundaries of its planet, “a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam,” in Carl Sagan’s words. Without the moonwalkers, its jurisdiction shrinks back, toward this one familiar planet, which soon could be the only place that living people have set foot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marina Koren</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/marina-koren/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/Moonwalkers/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Joan Wong; Photos courtesy of NASA</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Coming End of an Era at NASA</title><published>2019-07-27T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-27T19:05:18-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Soon, if no mission returns to the moon, no one on Earth will have set foot on another world.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-nasa-moon-buzz-aldrin/594910/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594871</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;About this time 50 years ago, three men returned home from a long journey. They had flown to the moon, planted an American flag in the silver regolith, and flown back. After a decade of jostling, the United States became the indisputable winner of the space race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the Soviet Union netted another kind of victory, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/how-the-soviets-won-the-space-race-for-equality.html"&gt;recent story&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;: “The Soviets won the space race for equality.” The story points out that after the Soviet Union made Yuri Gagarin the first man in space in 1961, the government sent the first woman, the first Asian man, and the first black man into orbit around Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It took the United States years to reach the same milestones, but the Soviet space program was not as woke as the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; story suggests. Nationalist intentions, not a push for equality, were behind the many “firsts” of that era, and focusing on those flashy events ignores what unfolded after the supposed win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort to bring women into the Soviet astronaut corps began when Nikolai Kamanin, the head of cosmonaut training, heard that female American pilots were training to become astronauts. (There was &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/women-in-space/498833/?utm_source=feed"&gt;no official NASA program&lt;/a&gt; to recruit female astronauts, but the doctor in charge of providing examinations to male astronaut candidates gave the same tests to women at his own clinic in 1960.) “We cannot allow that the first woman in space will be American,” Kamanin &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-84824-2_9"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in his journal. “This would be an insult to the patriotic feelings of Soviet women.” A search began shortly thereafter, and the first female astronaut candidates reported for training in 1962.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Kamanin couldn’t have said it any more plainly. The impetus was nationalistic—any egalitarian impulse was in service of that primary motivation. Soviet women would fly to space for one of the same reasons that the rockets carrying them did: to beat their Cold War enemy. The historic flight would demonstrate the superiority of the Soviet space program and, by extension, its socialist government over the capitalist United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Valentina Tereshkova, a 26-year-old textile worker with a love for skydiving, was launched into orbit in the summer of 1963 after months of training. If there was one moment that might have verged on equality in this propaganda exercise, it was when Tereshkova, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230523432_12"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; by Soviet officials as “Gagarin in a skirt,” was allowed to pee on the tire of the bus that delivered her to the launchpad, a tradition set by the first man in space. She spent three days circling Earth in a small, spherical capsule. When she returned, Tereshkova had racked up more hours in space than all the American astronauts combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tereshkova was celebrated as a national hero and a role model for young girls in the Soviet Union. “News items and feature stories openly encouraged girls to strive for the highest levels of achievement in science and technology, loudly affirming that in the USSR there were no limits on female aspiration,” Roshanna Sylvester, a scholar in residence at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies Russian history, wrote in &lt;em&gt;Into the Cosmos: Space Exploration and Soviet Culture&lt;/em&gt; in 2011. Tereshkova made dozens of trips abroad in the years after her flights, representing the Soviet government at international conferences on women’s issues, before being elected to the Russian State Duma, where she still serves today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But as Soviet leaders publicly touted her accomplishments, they continued to debate in private whether women should be astronauts. The masquerade didn’t last. Tereshkova never flew to space again. Neither did the other women who had trained with her. Tereshkova &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34270395"&gt;revealed decades later&lt;/a&gt; that the head of the space program decided against flying another woman because she “already had a family.” It was clear where the Soviets felt women belonged. A female cosmonaut would not fly again for another 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Soviets’ other firsts in space were similarly short-lived efforts. The Soviet Union sent foreign astronauts, including Phạm Tuân, a Vietnamese military pilot, and Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez, a Cuban military pilot of African descent, to the country’s Salyut space station in 1980. By then, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had little to compete over in outer space and had &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/nasa-roscosmos-russia-bridenstine-rogozin/579973/?utm_source=feed"&gt;actually begun to collaborate&lt;/a&gt;. The first-time travelers, accompanied by cosmonauts, were part of&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Interkosmos-Eastern-Program-Springer-Praxis/dp/3319241613"&gt; a Soviet program&lt;/a&gt; that was intended to bolster connections with other socialist nations in eastern Europe and Asia, and ended in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The U.S. was driven by the same motivations as the Soviet Union in its own space efforts. After Gagarin went to space, the Johnson administration began a search for an African American candidate for NASA’s astronaut program. In the divisive Cold War climate, astronauts were “goodwill ambassadors” dispatched to promote American political ideals, Douglas Brinkley, a historian who has written about the American effort to land on the moon, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/ed-dwight-was-set-to-be-the-first-black-astronaut-heres-why-that-never-happened.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in a different recent story. “You put a person of color in space and it’ll show how noble our democracy is,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An Air Force pilot, Ed Dwight, was in the running in 1962 to become the first black person to go to space, but he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/ed-dwight-was-set-to-be-the-first-black-astronaut-heres-why-that-never-happened.html"&gt;never became an astronaut&lt;/a&gt;, despite a recommendation from the military to NASA. Unlike the other trainees, Dwight experienced frequent racist encounters and, reportedly, daily taunts from his commander encouraging him to quit. The space agency never provided an explanation for why he wasn’t selected. The first African American to become a NASA astronaut, Robert Lawrence, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/robert-lawrence-first-african-american-astronaut"&gt;died in a plane crash&lt;/a&gt; during training in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It wasn't until 1983 that Guion Bluford flew on the space shuttle, becoming the first African American in space. Ellison Onizuka, the first Asian American in space, followed two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both Cold War powers, demonstrating prowess mattered more than enacting progress. And if history books had ceased printing in the 1980s, then sure, they would say the Soviet Union bested its Cold War rival in the space race for equality. But the hard work of equal representation is more than a matter of giving one woman or one black man a rare opportunity, and a half century later, the Soviet, now Russian, space program has fallen way behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Over the decades, as the Americans caught up, the Russians backtracked. Since Sally Ride became the first American woman in space, NASA has flown nearly 50 female astronauts to orbit. Russia has sent four, including Tereshkova. At NASA, motherhood was not considered disqualifying; in 1984, Anna Fisher flew on the shuttle 14 months &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/05/11/she-was-pregnant-when-nasa-offered-send-her-space-anna-fisher-didnt-hesitate/?utm_term=.393263b2a250"&gt;after giving birth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;NASA’s &lt;a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-091817a-turtles-astronaut-class-nickname.html"&gt;latest astronaut class&lt;/a&gt;, selected in 2017, includes six men and five women, and five recruits are people of color. Russia’s &lt;a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-081318a-roscosmos-cosmonaut-candidates-brother.html"&gt;newest eight recruits&lt;/a&gt;, announced last year, are all white men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The director of the spaceflight program &lt;a href="https://tass.com/science/1017538"&gt;offered an explanation&lt;/a&gt; for the absence of women that seems to belong in the 1960s: “One of the main requirements for those willing to join the crew is determination, the desire to become a cosmonaut.

Men launched atop rockets to space. Men maneuvered landers down to the surface of the moon. Men guided spacecraft safely home. From start to finish, they were at the controls. So it makes sense that the effort to send people to orbit and beyond was called “manned” spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Peggy Whitson hears someone call the spaceflight program “manned” today, she can’t stifle her physical reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I cringe a little bit,” Whitson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terminology is simply no longer accurate, and Whitson, a former astronaut at NASA, is just one example why. Whitson served as commander on two missions to the International Space Station, and spent 665 days in space, more than any other American astronaut, man or woman. NASA retired the description years ago, saving it for historical references to its early days, and now uses &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;crewed&lt;/em&gt;. But as the country commemorated the 50th anniversary of the moon landing last week, the obsolete language cropped up in discussions about the modern American spaceflight program and its future, in &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?462641-1/nasa-administrator-bridenstine-testifies-space-exploration-moon-mars"&gt;congressional hearings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1151998598197862401"&gt;national headlines&lt;/a&gt; (some of which were edited quietly &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/forget-new-manned-missions-in-space-nasa-should-focus-on-saving-earth/2019/07/18/79e55eb8-a995-11e9-9214-246e594de5d5_story.html?utm_term=.dab84c60799f"&gt;after publication&lt;/a&gt;), and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It shouldn’t happen again. &lt;em&gt;Manned&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/10/manned-spaceflight-time-to-change-the-language.html"&gt;woefully outdated&lt;/a&gt; choice of vocabulary to describe the actions of an organization that has employed female astronauts for the majority of its existence. Language &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/ultima-thule-nasa-nazi/589693/?utm_source=feed"&gt;matters&lt;/a&gt;, and this particular vernacular reinforces the notion, once held to be true, that space exploration is for men only. It does a disservice to the dozens of women who became astronauts after Apollo, and to those who dream of doing the same. “You can’t be what you can’t see,” Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, once &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2012/09/sally-ride"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. The same is true of what you can’t hear or read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 1962, Congress convened a hearing to discuss the possibility of training female astronauts, after a group of 13 women &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/03/women-in-space/498833/?utm_source=feed"&gt;successfully completed&lt;/a&gt; the same tests NASA gave its male candidates, in some cases doing better than the men. “I think this gets back to the way our social order is organized, really,” John Glenn, who had become &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/12/john-glenn-astronaut-obituary/510068/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the first American to orbit&lt;/a&gt; Earth only months earlier, &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=sD92d6oiplYC&amp;amp;pg=PT139&amp;amp;lpg=PT139&amp;amp;dq=%22The+men+go+off+and+fight+the+wars+and+fly+the+airplanes+and+come+back+and+help+design+and+build+and+test+them.%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=BgZcFzBM04&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U3M8wc-vDkpWn-nTqxTdCgHeKVc8Q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwijvoTY9M_jAhXOt1kKHQTbDgAQ6AEwAnoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22The%20men%20go%20off%20and%20fight%20the%20wars%20and%20fly%20the%20airplanes%20and%20come%20back%20and%20help%20design%20and%20build%20and%20test%20them.%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; members of Congress. “The men go off and fight the wars and fly the airplanes and come back and help design and build and test them. The fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The group of female trainees was disbanded, and NASA went on to send dozens of men into orbit around Earth and to the moon, their journeys carefully monitored from Mission Control in the appropriately named Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That facility was renamed the Johnson Space Center in 1973, several months after the end of the sixth and final mission to touch down on the moon’s surface. The rebranding was a better match for NASA’s next chapter; the agency had just started sending robotic, passenger-free spacecraft beyond the moon and deeper into the solar system, the first in a long line of machines that would take over the work of exploring the cosmos. Of course, the agency had new terminology to go along with these new spacecraft, programmed and piloted from afar: &lt;em&gt;unmanned&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The push into deep space coincided with the development of NASA’s next generation of astronaut transportation, the space-shuttle program. The massive shuttle could carry far more people than the cramped Apollo capsules, which meant the passenger list didn’t have to be limited, as it had been, to mostly military pilots such as Neil Armstrong. Suddenly, there was room for the astronaut corps to more closely resemble the general population, including the half who had long been excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When NASA selected its first female astronauts in 1978, “manned” was still the standard label for spaceflight that included humans. It did not help that the needs of this new class of astronauts were often, and sometimes astonishingly, misunderstood. Before Ride became the first American woman in space, in 1983, NASA staffers &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; her whether 100 tampons would be enough for her one-week mission in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“When you’re a bloke, terms such as ‘mankind’ automatically include you. You don’t have to think about it at all; you’re already in there,” Alice Gorman, an archaeologist who studies the history and heritage of space exploration, &lt;a href="http://zoharesque.blogspot.com/2014/09/how-to-avoid-sexist-language-in-space.html"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on her blog in 2014. “Women have to ‘think themselves into’ such expressions, even if it happens at a subconscious level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Research has found that this feeling of exclusion can have real, measurable effects. Studies by the National Institute of Mental Health in the 1970s, when NASA first began to recruit women astronauts, showed that women were &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5774006/#R11"&gt;significantly less likely&lt;/a&gt; to apply for jobs with titles that ended in &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;. A similar effect was found among men, who avoided professions with feminine-sounding names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such thinking is difficult to dispel. A &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00288993"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of college students in 1988 found that those instructed to complete sentences about professionals using &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; were more likely to imagine men, even when the researchers said the pronouns applied to both men and women. When the students used gender-neutral language, they pictured fewer men as they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This subconscious reasoning can take root early. In a 2013 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879113000304"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, when elementary-school teachers described male-dominated professions, such as astronaut, using masculine rather than gender-neutral language, their female students were more likely to think that women in those roles were less successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Astronauts who joined NASA in the 1990s say the agency had shifted away from &lt;em&gt;manned&lt;/em&gt; and toward gender-neutral language by the time they arrived. But vestiges of Apollo-era vernacular still floated around, in part because many engineers who worked those missions were still at NASA. “There was still a lot of the same—I don’t want to say &lt;em&gt;mind-set&lt;/em&gt; in a negative sense—but, ‘We call it this because we call it this, and no one’s ever questioned it,’” says Danny Olivas, who &lt;a href="http://www.AstronautDannyOlivas.com"&gt;became an astronaut&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Pamela Melroy, another now-retired astronaut, remembers the terminology coming up in jokes. She joined NASA in 1995, after working as a pilot in the Air Force. When Melroy and a female colleague boarded a T-38, a sleek two-seater jet that astronauts often use for commuting, “the guys out on the flight line would tease me that it was an unmanned mission,” Melroy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;NASA formally codified its preference for &lt;em&gt;crewed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; over &lt;em&gt;manned&lt;/em&gt; to describe spaceflight in the early 2000s, as part of a “major overhaul” of the agency’s &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/styleguide.html"&gt;internal style guide&lt;/a&gt;, says Stephanie Schierholz, a NASA spokesperson. Today the entry appears as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;manned, unmanned&lt;/strong&gt;. Avoid use. In many cases, the distinction is unnecessary or implied. Substitute terms such as autonomous, crewed, human, piloted, unpiloted, robotic, remotely piloted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Now if we could just get others to follow suit,” Schierholz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The shift in NASA nomenclature did not prompt a massive revision of history books, or a frantic rush to wipe any mention of &lt;em&gt;manned&lt;/em&gt; from Apollo mission reports. It sought to capture the reality of the changing organization, an effort that is more common and less fraught than you might think. For example, in 2016, after the Pentagon opened all military combat roles to women, the Marine Corps &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/military/marine-corps-taking-man-out-19-job-titles-create-gender-n600966"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; from 19 job titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These days, the idea of an American manned-spaceflight program is a phantom. The proposal for the next moon mission not only includes women astronauts; it is named for Artemis, Apollo’s sister in Greek mythology—a woman, albeit an imaginary one. Donald Trump’s administration has stressed that the crew of the next lunar journey, targeted for 2024, will include the first woman to walk on the moon. NASA needs buckets of money from Congress to carry out the effort, so &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/trump-and-nasas-uncertain-moon-plans/593986/?utm_source=feed"&gt;its immediate future remains uncertain&lt;/a&gt;. But whether the next American trip to the moon launches five years from now or 50, it will not be a manned mission.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marina Koren</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/marina-koren/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/734129main_ISS016E026125_full_full/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>NASA</media:credit><media:description>Peggy Whitson, the American record holder for time spent in space</media:description></media:content><title type="html">The Outdated Language of Space Travel</title><published>2019-07-25T13:57:16-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-26T13:20:56-04:00</updated><summary type="html">“Manned” spaceflight doesn’t make sense anymore.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/manned-spaceflight-nasa/594835/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594673</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At some point, a kauri tree fell in a New Zealand forest, and no one noticed. Nor did anyone pay attention when the remnant of its trunk rotted away, leaving behind a stump that’s barely even a stump—a chair-size, hollowed-out half cylinder, sticking up from the middle of a hiking trail, leafless and apparently dead. “It doesn’t look spectacular at all,” says &lt;a href="https://www.aut.ac.nz/profiles/sebastian-leuzinger"&gt;Sebastian Leuzinger&lt;/a&gt; of  the Auckland University of Technology. “Everyone would have walked past it for years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Leuzinger saw the stump, on a walk with fellow botanist Martin Bader, his head turned. He saw that even though it had no leaves, stems, or greenery of any kind, it did still contain living tissue—and when he knocked on the stump, it &lt;em&gt;sounded&lt;/em&gt; different from deadwood. All appearances to the contrary, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(19)30146-4"&gt;it’s still alive&lt;/a&gt;. How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leuzinger and Bader eventually showed that the stump is connected to one or more of the kauri trees around it, probably via its roots. They are hydraulically coupled: The water flowing through the full-size trees also drives water through the stump, keeping it alive. It will never green again, never make cones or seeds or pollen, never unfall, never reclaim its towering verticality. But at least for now, it’s not going to die, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/04/trees-have-their-own-songs/521742/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trees have their own song&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How best to think about the living stump? Is it a vampiric parasite that sustains its undead existence by leeching the supplies of its fellow trees? Is it a beneficial partner that extends the root network of those other kauri in exchange for water? Is it even an individual entity anymore, or just a part of its neighbors? Without chlorophyll to harness the sun’s energy and make its own food, is it really much of a plant, or something more like a fungus or an animal—an organism that gets its nutrients from other living things? “I think this is really exciting,” says &lt;a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/franciska.devries.html"&gt;Franciska de Vries&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Amsterdam. “It poses so many questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="576" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/Capture/aa567a404.jpg" width="698"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;Credit: Sebastian Leuzinger&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underground, trees are intimately connected. The fungi on their roots can wire adjacent individuals to one another and ferry nutrients between them, creating what ecologists have come to call a “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-wood-wide-web/478224/?utm_source=feed"&gt;wood-wide web&lt;/a&gt;.” The roots themselves can also graft directly onto one another—a phenomenon that’s been documented in about 150 species, but is still mysterious. Why do it? Researchers have suggested that these natural grafts stabilize the trees, or allow them to share resources during times of hardship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if one of the connected trees becomes a stump? Living stumps—no leaves, but intact roots—were documented first in 1833, and several times since. There’s a signposted one, for example, in &lt;a href="https://www.nationalparksblog.com/living-tree-stump-rogue-river-gorge/"&gt;Oregon’s Rogue River Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have long assumed that their roots are connected to those of their neighbors, but that doesn’t fully explain how they survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem: Water isn’t &lt;em&gt;pumped &lt;/em&gt;through trees, but &lt;em&gt;pulled&lt;/em&gt;. The water that evaporates from leaves drags more water up through stems and from roots—a process called transpiration. But without leaves, &lt;a href="https://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=49197"&gt;that pulling force&lt;/a&gt; is absent. Water doesn’t flow, and neither do the nutrients dissolved within it. The innards of a leafless stump should be stagnant. Instead, they’re still on the move. Leuzinger and Bader proved that by inserting small needles into the water-carrying tissues, releasing small pulses of heat from one needle at intervals, and then detecting the pulses with the others. The stump’s water flows at a fifth the speed of its neighbors’, but it &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed of that flow depends on what the surrounding trees are doing. If the neighbors’ sap flows faster, the stump’s sap flows slower. But if the neighbors reduce transpiration, whether at night or during heavy rain, the stump’s sap starts racing. This suggests that it isn’t just a passive part of its neighbors’ roots. Instead, it seemingly uses their downtime to gain more water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/04/why-trees-thrive-farther-their-parents/586411/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Tree seedlings have a very good reason to shirk their parents&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would the intact trees keep their connections to a partner that’s no longer contributing anything itself? They might benefit because the stump’s roots extend the range over which they can collect water, Leuzinger says. Or it could just be that they can’t identify freeloaders in their networks, or dissociate from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the stump keeps water flowing is still a mystery. “The vessels in a tree aren’t built for this,” Leuzinger says. “They’re one-directional. Water goes from the roots to the crown. But if you’re a living stump, you have to reorganize your pathways so water can enter and leave again. This is completely unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear exactly how the stump keeps water flowing to its neighbors, because the team didn’t dig up its roots to check. (That would require a permit, because the kauri is a protected species.) “However, it’s 100 percent that there is a root graft,” says &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9t0S1KkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=fr"&gt;Annie Desrochers&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Québec at Abitibi-Témiscamingue. “Otherwise, how could the stump be living?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Leuzinger and Bader haven’t been able to find any similar kauri stumps, and while local foresters told them they have seen examples before, no one could point them to one. “It would be really interesting to find out whether this is a regularly occurring phenomenon rather than a one-off observation,” de Vries says. “That would have far-reaching implications for forest ecology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/baobab-trees-dying-climate-change/562499/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Trees that have lived for millennia are suddenly dying&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desrochers certainly thinks that it’s common, especially because she has found evidence of natural root grafts in every forest where she has looked. “That means trees can share water, nutrients, and diseases,” she says. If there’s a drought or insect epidemic,&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-06/ajob-irg060811.php"&gt; connected trees are more likely to survive&lt;/a&gt;, because resources can flow from unaffected individuals to beleaguered ones. Yet if a forest is thinned, the surviving trees might be stuck supporting connected but unproductive roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If times are good, she suspects that “supporting a stump or a weaker connected neighbor doesn’t make much difference.” But harsher conditions could destroy an entire stand “because the few photosynthesizing trees cannot support a large root biomass, which they cannot ‘choose’ to stop feeding, because they are connected with wood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That really changes our view on forest mortality,” Leuzinger adds. If living, intact trees regularly share water through connected supplies, “we need to look at forests as superorganisms,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ed Yong</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/IMG_1248/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Sebastian Leuzinger</media:credit><media:description>Two botanists stumbled across this living kauri stump while on a walk in the woods.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">The Stump That Didn’t Die</title><published>2019-07-25T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-29T09:06:48-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Through underground connections with its neighbors, it somehow stays alive.

He had recently started studying tick saliva, a complex molecular cocktail that ticks inject into their hosts to inhibit pain, prevent blood clotting, and suppress the immune system—all so the tick can feed undetected for days and days and days. Ribeiro had been studying this in a lab, but now he was finally witnessing it in the flesh. In &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He marveled at the bite. It did not hurt. It did not itch. “I was amazed at how they could be so stealthy,” recalls Ribeiro, who now studies disease-carrying insects and ticks &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/jose-mc-ribeiro-md-phd"&gt;at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;. Ticks use saliva to manipulate the body of their hosts so their bites stay painless, itchless, and as unobtrusive as a bug swelling with blood can be. Scientists have since cataloged &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785505/"&gt;more than 3,500 proteins&lt;/a&gt; from the saliva of various tick species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ticks evolved this molecular cocktail because they, unlike virtually any other blood feeder, feed for days at a time on a single host. Most tick species feed only once during each stage of their life cycle (larva, nymph, adult), so they have to get a “voluminous blood meal” out of each host, says &lt;a href="https://www6.inra.fr/bipar/Qui-sommes-nous/Les-equipes/MiTick-Responsable-H.J.-Boulouis/L-equipe/Sarah-Bonnet"&gt;Sarah Bonnet&lt;/a&gt;, who studies ticks at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research. A tick might even wait years between feedings. In the meantime, it must subsist entirely on its previous blood meal. Each meal counts for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/ticks-can-take-down-800-pound-moose/583189/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Climate change has entered its blood-sucking phase&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When a tick starts to feed, it doesn’t suck blood out of blood vessels. Instead, it secretes enzymes in its saliva that destroy a small ring of host tissue. This creates a “feeding cavity,” which Ribeiro likens to a “lake of blood.” “The tick sucks blood from that lake,” he says. For this strategy to work though, ticks also need to make proteins that prevent blood from clotting, as it normally wants to do in an injury site. Over the course of days, a host’s body will try to heal the wound by sending cells that make collagen. Normally, this would allow the wound to scar over, but tick saliva has molecules to counteract this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lastly, the tick has to evade a host’s immune system. Mammals, including humans, have complex immune systems with multiple lines of defense, and tick saliva can neutralize pretty much all of them. To start, ticks secrete molecular “mops,” which bind to and neutralize histamine. Histamine is best known for causing itching and redness, but it also plays an important role in opening up blood vessels to allow immune cells to get to a site of injury. Tick saliva prevents this, so tick bites don’t itch and immune cells can’t get to the bite. Tick saliva also degrades pain-inducing molecular signals in a host. That’s why tick bites also do not hurt. Ticks then inject molecules that neutralize or evade a suite of white blood cells that would otherwise be eating or attacking an invader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The exact cocktail of a tick’s saliva proteins changes every few hours, Ribeiro says. The thousands of proteins in its saliva are highly redundant in function, and the tick cycles through them as a way of circumventing a host’s immune system. Immune systems take time to recognize and react to a foreign tick protein, and this strategy simply doesn’t give a host’s cells a chance to do that. Suppose, Ribeiro says, “Monday a tick starts feeding on you and injecting the saliva in you.” By Friday, when your body can mount a proper immune response against those first proteins, “the tick has already changed the repertoire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/insect-apocalypse-really-upon-us/583018/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Is the insect apocalypse really upon us?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ticks, of course, are noteworthy not just because they bite, but because they transmit diseases when they bite—including Lyme disease, babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/tick-borne/default.html"&gt; many, many others&lt;/a&gt;. And pathogens may take advantage of the fact that tick saliva suppresses a host’s immune system. Bonnet has found that ticks carrying the bacteria for cat-scratch disease (which, despite the name, is also transmitted by ticks) make more of a saliva protein called IrSPI. In a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/07/17/705921.full.pdf"&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt;, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, her team isolated IrSPI and found that it suppresses multiple types of white blood cells, weakening a host’s defenses at the bite. The upshot is that ticks can feed undetected, and bacteria can spread into a new host undetected. Tick saliva seems to help not just ticks, but the bacteria that live inside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But Bonnet thinks IrSPI could also be turned into a weakness. It could be a target for vaccines. If people are inoculated against IrSPI, their bodies might immediately recognize a tick bite and mount an immune response, preventing the tick from working its saliva tricks. (That's why people who are bitten repeatedly will sometimes find the bites starting to itch.) Scientists are also interested in components of tick saliva that could be useful in cases where doctors want to inhibit pain or prevent blood from clotting. Ribeiro notes that this could be challenging because the proteins in tick saliva tend to be large and complicated—in other words, difficult to mass produce. But molecules from tick saliva are already being used to study certain unknown pathways in the human immune system. For example, scientists have used &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28855397"&gt;tick saliva&lt;/a&gt; to study how HIV infects cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Using tick saliva to study the human immune system makes a kind of sense. Over millions of years of evolution, ticks have essentially reverse engineered their hosts’ immune systems to evade them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sarah Zhang</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sarah-zhang/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/18_Ixodes_ricinus_copy/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Jana Bulantová / Creative Commons</media:credit><media:description>Hard ticks inject saliva that suppresses the host immune system</media:description></media:content><title type="html">What Tick Saliva Does to the Human Body</title><published>2019-07-25T07:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-25T11:40:47-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Ticks use their saliva to create a “lake of blood” inside their hosts.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/the-marvels-of-tick-saliva/594652/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594517</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the planet’s perspective, one of the most significant events of the past 2,000 years occurred on April 5, 1815, when the Indonesian volcano Mount Tambora began to erupt. “The noise was, in the first instance, almost universally attributed to a distant cannon,” &lt;a href="https://archive.org/stream/memoiroflifepubl00raff#page/n271/mode/2up"&gt;wrote a British statesman&lt;/a&gt; stationed hundreds of miles away on Java. Soon “the sun became obscured” with ash, and by the next week, fog-like smoke reduced visibility to 900 feet, while earthquakes shook the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tambora was the largest volcanic eruption since the end of the last Ice Age, one of a series of eruptions that pumped huge amounts of sunlight-reflecting gas into the atmosphere. This gas darkened and chilled summers in Europe. It weakened the monsoons in India and West Africa. It allowed glaciers to advance in the Alps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, these eruptions brought about a kind of natural climate change. But it was felt differently in different places. And new research confirms that it pales in comparison to the climate change we now face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/do-most-americans-believe-climate-change-polls-say-yes/580957/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The unprecedented surge in fear about climate change&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely nothing resembling modern-day global warming has happened on Earth for at least the past 2,000 years, a new study published today in &lt;i&gt;Nature &lt;/i&gt;confirms. Since the birth of Jesus Christ, the climate has sometimes naturally changed—some parts of the world have briefly cooled, and some have briefly warmed—but it has never changed as it’s changing now. Never once until the Industrial Revolution did temperatures surge in the same direction everywhere at the same time. They’re doing so now, the study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a huge database of climate-recording objects from all over the world—including &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/trees-of-deep-time-are-a-portal-to-the-past-and-the-future"&gt;tree rings&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/speleothem"&gt; cave formations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/the-worlds-most-urgent-science-project/474558/?utm_source=feed"&gt;ancient pollen trapped in lake mud&lt;/a&gt;—the study concludes that 98 percent of Earth’s surface experienced its hottest period of the past 2,000 years within living memory. That uniform heat spike “is unprecedented over the Common Era,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest finding may not surprise most climate scientists, who suspect that the planet is &lt;a href="https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/1#section-9"&gt;as hot now as it’s ever been in at least the past 125,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. But it may shock some politicians, who have downplayed modern-day climate change by talking about those past shifts. “The climate has always been changing. There has never been a time when the climate has not changed,” &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/676198899/climate-scientist-says-argument-the-climate-is-always-changing-is-wrong"&gt;said Senator Marco Rubio at a Republican presidential debate in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To which the study replies: Sure. It just hasn’t changed &lt;em&gt;like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fairness, that wasn’t always clear. Decades ago, researchers talked about the past periods of climate change as global events. They cited the Little Ice Age, which began in roughly 1550 and ended around 1850, as an era when global temperatures fell everywhere. But this study—and work from other scholars—suggests that the Little Ice Age wasn’t global at all, and mostly lowered temperatures in western Europe and parts of North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, the understanding of climate over [the past 2,000 years] is that there were globally coherent periods of climate variability—that there was a cold period called the Little Ice Age, [or] that there was a warm period called the Medieval Climate Anomaly,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~nsteiger/"&gt;Nathan Steiger&lt;/a&gt;, an author of the paper and a research scientist at Columbia, at a press conference this week. “What we show is that these periods weren’t globally coherent, as previously thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/rcp-85-the-climate-change-disaster-scenario/579700/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Are we living through climate change’s worst-case scenario?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes those older eras different from modern warming is &lt;em&gt;coherence—&lt;/em&gt;that climate change is happening today just about everywhere at the same time. “That coherence cannot be explained by the natural variability of the climate system,” Steiger said. And it does not characterize any previous era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is another nail in the coffin of the idea of that there was a globally warm or cold period that fit tidily into a specific couple of centuries,” said &lt;a href="https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/our-people/faculty/axford-yarrow.html"&gt;Yarrow Axford&lt;/a&gt;, a climate scientist at Northwestern University, in an email. She was not involved in writing the new paper. The idea that the Little Ice Age or eras like it were uniform global events was “already dying within the scientific community,” she said, yet that idea remains “perennially popular with nonexperts who want to sow doubt about the significance of the dramatic and truly global warming that has occurred in the past century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the nonexperts who have tacitly embraced that idea: Donald Trump. The president has repeatedly brought up the fluctuating nature of the climate in order to downplay current change. “Something’s changing, and it’ll change back again,” &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/676198899/climate-scientist-says-argument-the-climate-is-always-changing-is-wrong"&gt;he said on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robinson Meyer</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/B2124F12_6677_4543_AAE0_DB2E98FBE6AC/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Rafael Marchante / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Climate-change heat has helped fuel searing temperatures and wildfires across Portugal this year, such as this one in Chaveira.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">No Climate Event in 2,000 Years Compares to What’s Happening Now</title><published>2019-07-24T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-24T21:14:33-04:00</updated><summary type="html">While parts of the world have warmed or cooled in the past, modern climate change is happening just about everywhere at the same time.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/why-little-ice-age-doesnt-matter/594517/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594625</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are a few rules for handling pieces of the moon collected by Apollo astronauts. Keep the samples locked in a safe. Don’t blab to everyone that you have some. Don’t destroy them, unless you’ve been given permission; sometimes, in the name of science, the samples must be dissolved in acid. And, most important, don’t sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“If you sneeze,” says Alex Sehlke, a geologist at NASA, “it’s gone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most scientists today study lunar samples from the Apollo era, they aren’t working with hefty boulders or even rocks. Their samples come in small vials, in the form of dust, with particles about the size of grains of sand. One wrong move, and the powdery specimen might end up scattered across the laboratory floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Apollo astronauts brought home much more than that, of course. From 1969 to 1972, the short but productive years of several moon landings, astronauts delivered &lt;a href="https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/"&gt;more than 800 pounds&lt;/a&gt; of lunar souvenirs, including chunks of rock and fine powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The samples from the first moon landing, collected by Neil Armstrong, completely transformed our understanding of the moon—and our place alongside it. Scientists discovered that the soil contained fragments of a rock called anorthosite, which tends to float to the top of magma. The moon today is undoubtedly barren—“magnificent desolation,” as Buzz Aldrin so wonderfully &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-moon-landing-site-today/594364/?utm_source=feed"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;. But the presence of anorthosite, right there on the surface, suggest a choppy, molten past—and an event powerful enough to liquefy the landscape. The analysis of these samples produced what remains the leading theory for the formation of the moon: Billions of years ago, a Mars-size world slammed into the young Earth and produced a fountain of debris that coalesced and cooled into the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, the majority of Apollo samples are stowed in a vault at Johnson Space Center, in Houston, behind the same kind of door one might find inside Federal Reserve banks in major U.S. cities, according to a NASA spokesperson. Curators loan them out to scientists around the world in small helpings. Soon, a special trove of samples will emerge from the vault. Scientists set them aside in the early 1970s. They hoped that someday other researchers would come along, with the same interest in Earth’s silvery companion, but better instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the next year, Sehlke, along with other scientists and their teams, will receive tiny lunar samples, untouched for close to 50 years, that were collected during the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-selects-teams-to-study-untouched-moon-samples"&gt;Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions&lt;/a&gt;. Some were frozen or stored in helium-filled containers shortly after arriving on Earth. One sample has never been exposed to Earth’s atmosphere; it was packed and vacuum-sealed on the moon by the last astronauts to walk on the surface, in 1972. Sehlke and other researchers still have many questions about the workings of the moon—even &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/moon-facts.html"&gt;about the popular hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; for its creation, which &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-made-the-moon-new-ideas-try-to-rescue-a-troubled-theory-20170802/"&gt;doesn’t completely add up&lt;/a&gt;—and searching for answers within these pristine samples is a thrilling prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I fully expect that we’re going to find some pretty exciting and profound new things about these samples,” says Darby Dyar, an astronomy professor at Mount Holyoke College, and one of the scientists who will receive a batch of both vacuum-sealed and helium-stored soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dyar has worked with lunar samples since 1979, when she was pursuing her doctoral degree in geochemistry. All had been exposed to the atmosphere before reaching her. In addition to potentially offering new surprises, the unspoiled samples could help her fact-check what she’s observed so far. “We’d like to be sure that what we’ve observed in the lunar samples is indeed a product of the way they were on the moon, and not something that was changed in them once they were exposed to air,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dyar is interested in microscopic by-products of the moon’s molten youth, when the surface erupted in volcanoes. The explosions spewed lava high above the surface, where temperatures were dramatically cooler. By the time the splatter fell back down, it had cooled into tiny beads of glass. The beads contain a record of the interior of the moon, another mystery yet to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In those days, we didn’t have technology that could look at things at a microscopic scale very well,” she says. She had to grind up already small samples to get a close look. But she’s ready now; she has spent years refining the technique for closely examining these little volcanic orbs, with microscope technology capable of examining nanometer-scale features. “This is exactly the technology that they were waiting on,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Only by geological circumstance have scientists managed to excavate—and may do so again—significant information about the history of the moon from such minuscule sources. The Apollo samples are not representative of the moon; they came from just six spots on the near side. But unlike Earth, the surface of the moon has remained mostly unchanged over billions of years. It is a geologist’s dream, and our planet is the nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We have liquid water on our planet, which, from a geology standpoint, really sucks,” says Juliane Gross, an Earth and planetary scientist at Rutgers University. “We have rain and wind, and it degrades rocks and turns them into soil, and then transports them into the ocean. And then we have plate tectonics—it’s even worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If extraterrestrial geologists landed outside of Gross’s office in New Jersey and scooped up some dirt, their knowledge of the planet would extend only a few million years into the past. The moon, free of weather and shifting ground, keeps better records. “The crust represents this archive of information, and all we need to do is learn how to read this archive and interpret it correctly,” Gross says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Scientists hope the archive will expand someday, with new missions to the moon. The Trump administration wants to return Americans to the surface in 2024, an ambitious plan &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/trump-and-nasas-uncertain-moon-plans/593986/?utm_source=feed"&gt;considering budget constraints&lt;/a&gt;, but the destination certainly is tantalizing: the south pole, where a massive impact carved a crater deep enough to expose potentially intriguing bits of the lunar crust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Until the next trip, NASA will reach into the vault. Curators must carefully remove the sealed samples and prepare them for shipment to the eager scientists. A NASA spokesperson would not disclose delivery details, citing security concerns, but researchers say they have received other lunar samples by mail, in small packages. Incredibly, they haven’t included &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;fragile&lt;/span&gt; stickers. Sehlke wondered whether he shouldn’t just drive down to Houston and pick up the samples himself; no offense to the post office, but this is precious cargo. He worries the package will pass through an X-ray machine in a shipping center somewhere, an experience that could alter the radiation signatures within the samples that he’s hoping to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When they arrive, Sehlke will analyze his haul—less than a teaspoon of material—at his lab at NASA’s Ames Research Center, in California; it will be tinged with red light to protect the properties of the delicate samples.The geologist will expose the grains to scorching temperatures, which will cause them to emit light. By examining that little glow, scientists can decipher the effects of sun exposure on the lunar soil over cosmic timescales. &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“We can reconstruct the past of the moon in terms of its temperature,” Sehlke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sehlke, who was born in the 1980s, well after the moon landings, says geologists conducted similar experiments on samples decades ago. But as his predecessors predicted, he has better technology now. And he’s grateful they saved some for him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marina Koren</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/marina-koren/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/TheAtlantic_MoonRocks_RAitken_Final_01/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Ruby Aitken; Photos courtesy of NASA / Getty</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Secrets of Moondust</title><published>2019-07-24T10:34:24-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-24T17:44:19-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Lunar samples, untouched by Earth’s atmosphere for decades, will soon emerge from a NASA vault.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/lunar-samples-apollo-nasa/594625/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594556</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Apollo 11 mission was, in most respects, a feat of extraordinary precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Traveling at a maximum velocity of about seven miles a second, the Saturn V rocket would have launched the crew far off course in the event of even a slight navigational error. From nearly 240,000 miles away, Houston’s Mission Control could track the spacecraft’s position to within 30 feet. The command module’s guidance computer kept time to the millisecond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And yet for all that precision, no one can say with absolute certainty when, &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Most of the details of the moment are canonical: Armstrong took his one small step on July 20, 1969—50 years ago this past Saturday. The step took place just after 10:56 eastern time that night. And Armstrong bookended the step with the lines “Okay, I’m going to step off the [lunar module] now” and “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” (Or was it “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/proposal-armstrong-flubbed-his-big-moon-speech-because-of-ohio/276473/?utm_source=feed"&gt;one small step for &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; man&lt;/a&gt;,” as Armstrong insisted?) At some point during the roughly eight-second interval between those two lines, he became the first human being to walk on the moon. But when exactly he did so is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The night of the moon landing, NASA told the press that Armstrong had stepped onto the lunar surface at 10:56:20 p.m., and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that same time stamp on its &lt;a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/07/21/issue.html"&gt;front page&lt;/a&gt; the next morning. The real-time transcription of the mission’s air-to-ground voice transmission suggests that Armstrong took the step sometime between 10:56:43 and 10:56:48. And when NASA’s official Apollo 11 mission report went public in November 1969, it pinpointed first contact five seconds earlier, at 10:56:15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-11-moon-heart-rates/593971/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The moment that made Neil Armstrong’s heart rate spike&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Experts agree that the time NASA fed reporters is probably the least reliable of the bunch. They also don’t put much stock in the air-to-ground transcript, a document rife with human error. Some even question the mission report, which incorporated months of data analysis and debriefings with the crew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Heiko Küffen, a German software engineer and space enthusiast, first came across this discrepancy in 2009, while trying to design a homemade real-time tracker that he could use to relive the moon landing for its 40th anniversary. (When I called Küffen a decade later, on the morning of the 50th anniversary, he told me that he couldn’t talk long, because he was closely following an online replay of the 195-hour Apollo 11 mission.) When he tried to match the air-to-ground transcript to an audiovisual recording, he found that the transcript was behind—and that one of the records had to be wrong about the time of Armstrong’s first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Küffen sees the moon landing as perhaps “the greatest achievement of mankind,” and he was disappointed that NASA had not recorded so great a milestone with greater precision. In 2011, he began analyzing transcripts and footage in an effort to establish a definitive time stamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The obstacles to absolute precision, Küffen soon discovered, are many. For starters, the moon is very far away, and even light takes more than one second to travel the 238,900 miles between here and there. So, too, did the audiovisual data beamed back down into the analog television sets of the roughly 500 million people watching as Armstrong descended the ladder of the lunar module. Add the time to process those data, and the delay between the moment Armstrong took the step and the moment viewers on Earth saw it extends to as long as a few seconds, by some accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even accounting for lag, synchronizing the audio with the video still poses a problem, mainly because hardly any of what’s audible in the recordings is visible in the footage. Had Armstrong taken out a bass drum and given it a thump just before stepping off the ladder, that moment would have anchored the sights to the sounds. But when the astronauts spoke, their reflective visors concealed their lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In the end,” Küffen acknowledged, “we can never know if video and audio are really in sync.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The one thing tying the audio recordings back to time stamps is the real-time air-to-ground transcript, which, of course, loops right back to the original problem: human error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-moon-landing-transcripts/594451/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The best banter from Apollo 11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“You have to remember that it wasn’t like an Olympic swim race where touching the wall stops the timer,” Bill Barry, NASA’s chief historian, said in an email, when I asked him about the discrepancy. “The exact time of Neil’s first boot contact with the lunar surface is necessarily subject to interpretation because it was measured from a distance with ‘tools’ that were never meant to produce precision down to the second.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To synchronize the transcripts and the recordings, Küffen made what he calls “reasonable assumptions,” which nearly a decade later he has yet to see contradicted. Armstrong, he found, first set foot on the moon at 10:56:25—closer, in other words, to the almost universally dismissed time given to the press that night than to the time produced by the mission report’s months-long analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Eric Jones, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory researcher who founded the &lt;a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/"&gt;Apollo Lunar Surface Journal&lt;/a&gt;, concluded after conducting an investigation modeled on Küffen’s that first contact occurred at 10:56:17. NASA’s sticking with its November 1969 mission report: If there’s an official time, Barry said, it’s 10:56:15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A half century of scrutiny may not have produced a solution, but it has fairly well established the insolubility of the problem. Barry, for one, is not especially concerned. “This,” he said, “is what happens when space geeks and engineers have 50 years to analyze and re-analyze data.” But listening to Küffen effuse in imperfect English, it’s hard to believe that geekery is all there is to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The adventure of going where nobody ever has been before, into the unknown, driven by our natural given curiosity, is deeply soul-touching, and so I dived into the matter a bit deeper,” he told me. “Knowing when walking on another celestial body happened for the very first time … has a meaning to me, because it is important it happened, and I believe we should know all about it the best possible and most detailed way, and that includes the exact time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Even if we don’t assign the moment of the step the kind of transcendental significance that Küffen does, our lingering uncertainty has a poignancy to it. Watching the Saturn V rocket rise “out of its incarnation of flame” at Kennedy Space Center, Norman Mailer wondered whether the Apollo 11 mission wasn’t one massive act of hubris, so vulgar as to verge on sacrilege. “The notion that man voyaged out to fulfill the desire of God,” Mailer wrote, “was either the heart of the vision, or anathema to that true angel in Heaven they would violate by the fires of their ascent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/norman-mailers-fire-moon-blastoff/594154/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: “The fires of their ascent”&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Contained within that moment of hubris, though, is a moment of humility. Even as we were surpassing the limits of human exploration, we were bumping up against the limits of human knowledge, though we didn’t realize it at the time. We may have slipped the surly bonds of Earth and touched the face of God, but we were not infallible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When I asked Küffen why he’s devoted so many hours to analyzing a single second, he answered with his favorite quote from the Apollo program. The quote doesn’t come from Apollo 11, but from Apollo 15. Standing on the lunar surface, looking out over the plains of Hadley, Commander David Scott understood “a fundamental truth to our nature.” “Man,” he said, “must explore. And this is exploration at its greatest.” Inconsequential as it seems, Küffen’s quest to answer an unanswerable question expresses that same fundamental nature, perhaps even in terms more universal than Scott’s: Few of us have walked the moon, but almost all of us have sought to know what cannot be known.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jacob Stern</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/jacob-stern/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/339773main_apollo_image_11a/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>NASA</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">One Small Controversy About Neil Armstrong’s Giant Leap</title><published>2019-07-23T11:46:18-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-25T09:24:29-04:00</updated><summary type="html">When, exactly, did the astronaut set foot on the moon?

His goals were lofty: “It’s perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality, and perhaps to even also understand physical reality.” His timeline was ambitious: “We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you.” If the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/expanding-brain"&gt;galaxy-brain meme&lt;/a&gt; had existed then, it would have been a great time to invoke it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been exactly 10 years. &lt;a href="http://nautil.us/blog/the-big-problem-with-big-science-ventureslike-the-human-brain-project"&gt;He did not succeed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One could argue that the nature of pioneers is to reach far and talk big, and that it’s churlish to single out any one failed prediction when science is so full of them. (Science writers joke that breakthrough medicines and technologies always seem five to 10 years away, on a rolling window.) But Markram’s claims are worth revisiting for two reasons. First, the stakes were huge: In 2013, the European Commission awarded his initiative—the Human Brain Project (HBP)—a staggering 1 billion euro grant (worth about $1.42 billion at the time). Second, the HBP’s efforts, and the intense backlash to them, exposed important divides in how neuroscientists think about the brain and how it should be studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markram’s goal wasn’t to create a simplified version of the brain, but a gloriously complex facsimile, down to the constituent neurons, the electrical activity coursing along them, and even the genes turning on and off within them. From the outset, the criticism to this approach was very widespread, and to many other neuroscientists, its bottom-up strategy seemed implausible to the point of absurdity. The brain’s intricacies—how neurons connect and cooperate, how memories form, how decisions are made—are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/can-neuroscience-understand-donkey-kong-let-alone-a-brain/485177/?utm_source=feed"&gt;more unknown than known&lt;/a&gt;, and couldn’t possibly be deciphered in enough detail within a mere decade. It is hard enough to map and model the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-07/aeco-fcw062819.php"&gt;302 neurons&lt;/a&gt; of the roundworm &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, let alone the 86 &lt;em&gt;billion &lt;/em&gt;neurons within our skulls. “People thought it was unrealistic and not even reasonable as a goal,” says the neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://neurdiness.wordpress.com/about-the-neurd/"&gt;Grace Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;, who is writing a book about modeling the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/what-happens-as-we-get-better-at-artificially-growing-brains/558881/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What’s wrong with growing blobs of brain tissue?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what was the point? The HBP wasn’t trying to address any particular research question, or test a specific hypothesis about how the brain works. The simulation seemed like an end in itself—an overengineered answer to a nonexistent question, a tool in search of a use. When the Blue Brain Project, a related venture that Markram founded, &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)01191-5"&gt;released a simulation of 30,000 rat neurons&lt;/a&gt; in 2015—a mere 0.15 percent of the rodent’s tiny brain—&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/rat-brain-or-smidgeon-it-modeled-computer"&gt;critics billed it&lt;/a&gt; as a lot of work that revealed nothing new. Even if it could scale up to human-size in time, why should it? “Now you’d have a brain in a computer, and before you had a brain in a skull,” Lindsay says. “What does that tell you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130207-will-we-ever-simulate-the-brain"&gt;Markram explained&lt;/a&gt; that, contra his TED Talk, he had never intended for the simulation to do much of anything. He wasn’t out to make an artificial intelligence, or beat a Turing test. Instead, he pitched it as an experimental test bed—a way for scientists to test their hypotheses without having to prod an animal’s head. “That would be incredibly valuable,” Lindsay says, but it’s based on circular logic. A simulation might well allow researchers to test ideas about the brain, but those ideas would &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; have to be very advanced to pull off the simulation in the first place. “Once neuroscience is ‘finished,’ we should be able to do it, but to have it as an intermediate step along the way seems difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not obvious to me what the very large-scale nature of the simulation would accomplish,” adds &lt;a href="http://churchlandlab.labsites.cshl.edu/"&gt;Anne Churchland&lt;/a&gt; from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Her team, for example, simulates networks of neurons to study how brains combine visual and auditory information. “I could implement that with hundreds of thousands of neurons, and it’s not clear what it would buy me if I had 70 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper titled “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0896627319302909"&gt;The Scientific Case for Brain Simulations&lt;/a&gt;,” several HBP scientists argued that big simulations “will likely be indispensable for bridging the scales between the neuron and system levels in the brain.” In other words: Scientists can look at the nuts and bolts of how neurons work, and they can study the behavior of entire organisms, but they need simulations to show how the former create the latter. The paper’s authors drew a comparison to weather forecasts, in which an understanding of physics and chemistry at the scale of neighborhoods allows us to accurately predict temperature, rainfall, and wind across the whole globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/a-new-genetic-clue-to-how-our-brains-got-so-big/561602/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: A new genetic clue to how humans got such big brains&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analogy doesn’t work, says &lt;a href="https://depts.washington.edu/neurogrd/people/faculty/adrienne-fairhall/"&gt;Adrienne Fairhall&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist from the University of Washington who has a background in physics. Yes, large-scale simulations are useful for understanding weather and galaxies, but “planetary systems are not about anything other than themselves,” she says. “A brain is built to be about other things.” That is: It takes in information about the world, and it moves human and animal bodies, which then influence that world. How much would we really learn from a disembodied brain in a virtual jar, which isn’t connected to eyes, ears, or limbs? “You could take a chunk of tissue and do all the physics, but it wouldn’t get at what it’s all for,” Fairhall says. “Biology is matter that has meaning. Simulating the tissue is doable, but meaningless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HBP, then, is in a very odd position, criticized for being simultaneously too grandiose &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; too narrow. None of the skeptics I spoke with was dismissing the idea of simulating parts of the brain, but all of them felt that such efforts should be driven by actual research questions. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/xiao-jing-wang/"&gt;Xiao-Jing Wang&lt;/a&gt; from New York University has built models that show how neurons, if connected in a certain way, can hold on to electrical activity even if they’re not being stimulated—the essence of what we call working memory, or the ability to hold on to thoughts. Meanwhile, Chris Eliasmith from the University of Waterloo has built &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/simulated-brain-scores-top-test-marks-1.11914"&gt;a model called Spaun&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a simplified set of 2.5 million virtual neurons to do simple arithmetic and solve basic reasoning problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countless such projects could have been funded with the money channeled into the HBP, which explains much of the furor around the project. In 2014, almost 800 neuroscientists &lt;a href="https://www.neurofuture.eu/"&gt;wrote an open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the European Commission saying that “the HBP is not a well conceived or implemented project and that it is ill suited to be the centerpiece of European neuroscience.” A year later, a mediation committee &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/rethinking-the-brain-1.17168"&gt;agreed with the critics&lt;/a&gt;, asking the HBP &lt;a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/PORTAL/DE/pressedownloads/2015/15-03-19hbp-recommendations.pdf;jsessionid=372C2F7FB5D6EFBEF8F18BA900D2F471?__blob=publicationFile"&gt;to refocus its efforts&lt;/a&gt; “on a smaller number of properly prioritized activities” and to retool its &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/news/rethinking-the-brain-1.17168"&gt;unorthodox governance structure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HBP acquiesced. It &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/the-human-brain-project-reboots-a-search-engine-for-the-brain-is-in-sight"&gt;effectively rebranded itself&lt;/a&gt; as a software project that curates existing data about the brain, provides tools for searching those data, and develops simulators that will allow others to build their own models. And with the big bolus of funding set to expire in 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0896627319302909"&gt;team’s recent paper&lt;/a&gt; reads like a plea for more investment. “The development of high-quality brain simulators requires a long-term commitment of resources,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s telling, though, that the people I contacted struggled to name a major contribution that the HBP has made in the past decade. That’s not to say that such contributions don’t exist. It’s more that they don’t seem to have made a splash proportional to the project’s budget, or perhaps that the HBP still has to earn back the trust of a community it alienated through hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/power-causes-brain-damage/528711/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Power causes brain damage&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markram seems undeterred. In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00032/full"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, he and his colleague Xue Fan firmly situated brain simulations within not just neuroscience as a field, but the entire arc of Western philosophy and human civilization. And in an email statement, he told me, “Political resistance (non-scientific) to the project has indeed slowed us down considerably, but it has by no means stopped us nor will it.” He noted the 140 people still working on the Blue Brain Project, a recent set of positive reviews from five external reviewers, and its “exponentially increasing” ability to “build biologically accurate models of larger and larger brain regions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No time frame, this time, but there’s no shortage of other people ready to make extravagant claims about the future of neuroscience. In 2014, I attended TED’s main Vancouver conference and watched the opening talk, from the MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte. &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_negroponte_a_30_year_history_of_the_future"&gt;In his closing words&lt;/a&gt;, he claimed that in 30 years, “we are going to ingest information. You’re going to swallow a pill and know English. You’re going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare. And the way to do it is through the bloodstream. So once it’s in your bloodstream, it basically goes through it and gets into the brain, and when it knows that it’s in the brain, in the different pieces, it deposits it in the right places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over my left shoulder, a hushed voice whispered, “Wow.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ed Yong</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/RTR486DG/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Ralph Orlowski / Reuters</media:credit><media:description>Henry Markram, the founder of the Human Brain Project</media:description></media:content><title type="html">The Human Brain Project Hasn’t Lived Up to Its Promise</title><published>2019-07-22T14:16:52-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-24T10:02:50-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Ten years ago, a neuroscientist said that within a decade he could simulate a human brain.

Spay and neuter everything. It’s what vets were taught. It’s what responsible pet owners were told to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A growing body of research, however, suggests that spaying and neutering—especially in some large breeds when very young—are linked to certain disorders later in life. “As time has gone on, vets are starting to question the wisdom,” says &lt;a href="https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/people"&gt;Missy Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinary epidemiologist with the Morris Animal Foundation, which recently published a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0209131"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found higher rates of obesity and orthopedic injury in golden retrievers that had been fixed. Other studies have linked early spaying and neutering to certain cancers, joint disorders, and urinary incontinence—though the risks tend to vary by sex, breed, and living circumstances. As such, the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Reference/AnimalWelfare/Pages/Elective-Spaying-Neutering-Pets.aspx"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) now says&lt;/a&gt; in a guide for veterinarians, “There is no single recommendation that would be appropriate for all dogs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And yet anyone adopting from a shelter is unlikely to be told of these risks—or even to be given a choice. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/Advocacy/StateAndLocal/Pages/sr-spay-neuter-laws.aspx"&gt;according to the AVMA&lt;/a&gt;, 31 states and the District of Columbia require sterilization or a promise of such before pets can be adopted out of shelters. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) also advocates early spaying or neutering of all companion animals &lt;a href="https://www.aspca.org/about-us/aspca-policy-and-position-statements/companion-animal-birth-control"&gt;at two months or two pounds in weight&lt;/a&gt;. Its information &lt;a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/spayneuter-your-pet"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; for pet owners touts the very real benefits of the procedures—behavioral changes, fewer uterine infections, a decreased risk of certain cancers—but with nary a mention of possible downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/06/domestication-gave-dogs-two-new-eye-muscles/591868/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Why do dogs look so sad?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For animal-welfare groups trying to manage unwanted populations, this strategy makes a kind of sense. “We’re trying to look at the big picture,” says Lori Bierbrier, the medical director of the ASPCA. “One of the ways to manage that population is not to have animals going out and having puppies and kittens all the time.” For dogs that already have an owner, she says, whether to spay or neuter is that owner’s individual decision. But that also makes talking about the research reevaluating the risks of spaying and neutering tricky. How do you balance raising concerns about risks for individual dogs with the welfare of dogs as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Oh my gosh, we got pushback,” says &lt;a href="https://biology.ucdavis.edu/people/benjamin-hart"&gt;Benjamin Hart&lt;/a&gt;, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. In 2013, a team led by Hart and his wife and collaborator, &lt;a href="https://www2.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty2/results.cfm?fid=14642"&gt;Lynette Hart&lt;/a&gt;, published a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055937"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found higher rates of joint disorders in golden retrievers spayed or neutered before one year of age and of certain cancers in female golden retrievers that were spayed early. It immediately &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/131101a.aspx"&gt;caused an uproar&lt;/a&gt;. “This is irresponsible,” Hart recalls critics saying. “You’re looking at just one breed. You can’t generalize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So they started looking at other breeds. The Harts have since published two follow-up papers, on &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102241"&gt;Labrador retrievers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/vms3.34"&gt;German shepherds&lt;/a&gt;, also finding an elevated risk of joint disorders but not of cancers after early spaying and neutering. And they have just finished another study, on 35 different dog breeds as well as mixed breeds. The risks of cancers and joint disorders appear to vary significantly by breed and sex, Hart says, with small dogs generally less affected by early neutering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/dogs-illness-detection/584614/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Y&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/guilty-dog-pictures-your-dog-feels-no-shame/550901/?utm_source=feed"&gt;our dog feels no shame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The takeaway, Hart says, is that when to spay or neuter should be a case-by-case decision, even for dogs adopted out of shelters. Simpson, of the Morris Animal Foundation, says that vets have already, based on recent research, started recommending delaying spaying and neutering for owners of large breeds. Puppies in shelters, though, might not get the same individual attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The risk of obesity, Simpson adds, is often the major concern for vets making spaying or neutering recommendations. Somewhere between a quarter to a third of pets in the United States are now obese. The link between obesity and spaying or neutering has to do with hormones. Removing a dog’s testicles or ovaries disrupts its hormonal balance, and this makes it &lt;a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/full/10.2460/javma.250.10.1155"&gt;both hungrier and slows its metabolism&lt;/a&gt; to require fewer calories. Yet animal-welfare groups that promote spaying and neutering are often quick to “debunk” the idea that fixing a dog could make it gain weight. The &lt;a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/spayneuter-your-pet"&gt;ASPCA’s website&lt;/a&gt; says, “Lack of exercise and overfeeding will cause your pet to pack on the extra pounds—not neutering.” This is technically true, but it elides a very real biological connection that owners might find useful to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When I brought this up with Bierbrier, she said the ASPCA staff would have to look into updating the website. She added that the ASPCA’s spay-and-neuter clinic does tell owners taking dogs home after the surgeries that their pets will require less food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Elsewhere in the world, spaying and neutering is not necessarily seen as the “responsible” thing to do. It is heavily discouraged in parts of Europe, &lt;a href="http://sciencenordic.com/should-dogs-be-neutered"&gt;such as Norway&lt;/a&gt;. Those countries also have very few stray dogs and a far less casual relationship with dog ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dogs that have not been fixed are, to put it one way, less convenient pets. Intact male dogs will want to roam in search of a mate; female dogs will go into heat and have bloody discharge. The campaign to spay and neuter dogs has also changed their very relationship to us as pets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sarah Zhang</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/sarah-zhang/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/GettyImages_138965532/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Victoria Neer / Getty</media:credit><media:description>Large dogs such as golden retrievers may benefit from delayed spaying and neutering.</media:description></media:content><title type="html">The Quietly Changing Consensus on Neutering Dogs</title><published>2019-07-22T11:53:26-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-22T17:38:59-04:00</updated><summary type="html">A growing body of research has documented the health risks of getting certain breeds fixed early—so why aren’t shelters changing their policies?</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/dog-neutering-health-risks-for-certain-breeds/594355/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594451</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Apollo 11 was all about the destination, but there was more to the mission than the landing itself. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins took an eight-day-long journey punctuated by a series of complicated procedures to reach the moon and make it back in one piece. And in between these tense maneuvers were easy conversations and playful jokes. After all, the crew was stuck with one another for hours. It wasn’t going to be business all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Apollo 11 &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/index.html"&gt;flight transcripts&lt;/a&gt; capture these buoyant moments in a sea of jargon about spacecraft systems. These exchanges feel familiar in an environment that is anything but. The astronauts drink hot coffee and eat sausage for breakfast; they listen to music; they make fun of one another and of Mission Control. Reading through the transcripts, it’s easy to forget these three men are actually hurtling through space at thousands of miles per hour, with no guarantee they’d get where &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-11-moon-heart-rates/593971/?utm_source=feed"&gt;they were going&lt;/a&gt;, and no guarantee &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/michael-collins-moon-landing-apollo-11/594238/?utm_source=feed"&gt;they’d come back&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, they sound just like a group of guys on a road trip. “If we’re late in answering you,” Collins told Mission Control several hours after they launched from Cape Canaveral, “it’s because we’re munching sandwiches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Forty-five minutes after the launch, the astronauts tried to get comfortable, sounding rather like friends settling in for a long car ride. Collins &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/02earth-orbit-tli.html"&gt;attempted to find a star&lt;/a&gt; named Menkent to help the spacecraft’s guidance systems figure out their orientation in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Menkent. God, what a star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Nobody in their right …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Menkent’s good …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: … nobody in their right mind would pick that one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: … Menkent’s a good star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey, I sure wish you’d get out that—that star chart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Can’t see a thing, huh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: No. It’s in the …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you look in the telescope?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: … in the sextant. Yes, but I can’t see it in the telescope. In the sextant—I can’t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: I believe it’s at the angle we have to mark on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a little on the chilly side in the cabin. Would you like …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Feels comfortable to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: … would you like it a little warmer, anybody?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t think so. I think it’s a little on the …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: The manual one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: It sure doesn’t look, sure doesn’t feel like—actually, it may be a little, it may be a little warm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, my, my feet are a little chilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Right away, &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/02earth-orbit-tli.html"&gt;the views were gorgeous&lt;/a&gt;. All three of them had seen the Earth from here on previous flights to space, but it’s no less breathtaking. As they watched the sun come over the horizon of the planet, they realized they can’t find a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Isn’t that something?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Goddamn, that’s pretty! This is unreal. I’d forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Get a picture of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Ooh, sure, I will. I’ve lost a Hasselblad. Has anybody seen a Hasselblad floating by? It couldn’t have gone very far, big son of a gun like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Now, what do we have—is that all the … ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: You had the switch on inside. [Garble]. Oh yeah. Okay. [Garble] automatic light control features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, that pisses me off! Hasselblad gone. Find that mother before she or I ends the [garble]. Everybody look for a floating Hasselblad. I see a pen floating loose down here, too. Is anybody missing a ballpoint pen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Got mine. Is it ballpoint, or is it [garble]?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, ballpoint. Here it is. I mean felt tip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: [Garble] much embarrassed to say they’ve lost a Hasselblad. I seem to be prone to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Collins was referring to his previous mission, Gemini 10, where he lost a camera during a spacewalk.) As the Apollo 11 spacecraft drifted farther from Earth, the crew members settled in for their first sleep. When they woke up, they &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/08day3-africa-breakfast.html"&gt;warmed up some breakfast&lt;/a&gt; and listened to Mission Control relay the news of the day. Mealtimes were peaceful times, perfect for some light ribbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: I’d like to enter Aldrin in the oatmeal eating contest next time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Bruce McCandless, in Mission Control]&lt;/strong&gt;: Is he pretty good at that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: He’s doing his share up here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCandless&lt;/strong&gt;: Let’s see. You all just finished a meal not long ago, too, didn’t you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m still eating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McCandless&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay. Does that, that …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: He’s on his—he’s on his 19th bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they approached the moon, they started picking out features on the surface, like kids pointing out horses on a drive through the country. This time, they had the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: What a spectacular view!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: God, look at that moon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Fantastic. Look back there behind us, sure looks like a gigantic crater; look at the mountains going around it. My gosh, they’re monsters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: See that real big …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, there’s a moose down here you just wouldn’t believe. There’s the biggest one yet. God, it’s huge! It is enormous! It’s so big I can’t even get it in the window. You want to look at that? That’s the biggest one you ever seen in your life. Neil? God, look at this central mountain peak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Isn’t that a huge one?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Look at the [garble]. Did you get some pictures of that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, I just took one. Can take another one here when he gets around a little better. It’s fantastic!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s kind of a foggy window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s a horrible window. It’s too bad we have to shoot through this one, but—oh, boy, you could spend a lifetime just geologizing that one crater alone, you know that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: You could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s not how I’d like to spend my lifetime, but—picture that. Beautiful!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, there’s a big mother over here, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Come on now, Buzz, don’t refer to them as big mothers. Give them some scientific name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was time, Armstrong and Aldrin clambered into the Eagle lunar lander while Collins stayed behind in the Columbia command module. The spacecraft separated, and the Eagle began its descent to the lunar surface. The two passengers sound like two travelers making sure they brought everything, with Aldrin jokingly chastising Armstrong for “overpacking”—bringing some items from the command module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Where’s your watch? Got your stopwatch?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Got it in my pocket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, the [garble] us over, huh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: And, one thing I’d appreciate if you could—see if you could—find the …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: What?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: The map.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes. Which one do you want? I’ve got …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: [Garble.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: That it? Where do you want it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Trade you that for a piece of gum. There it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: When do we have to get these? Alright, go on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you mean by bringing—bringing CSM trash in here?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, that’s stuff I had left over in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eagle nearly ran out of fuel just before they touched down. Back in Mission Control, Gene Kranz, the flight director, had told Charlie Duke, with 30 seconds left in the tank, that “you’d better remind Neil there ain’t no damn gas station on that moon.” (This frazzled moment doesn’t appear in NASA transcripts, and comes from an Armstrong &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neil-Armstrong-Flight-Jay-Barbree/dp/125004071X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr="&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt; by the longtime space journalist Jay Barbree.) On the surface, during humanity’s greatest pit stop, Armstrong and Aldrin stretched their legs. They twisted their torsos from side to side, jumped up and down, and shifted their weight from foot to foot. Armstrong &lt;a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html"&gt;nearly fell over&lt;/a&gt; after one particularly high leap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: (Garbled) very fine powder, isn’t it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Isn’t it fine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Right in this area I don’t think there’s much of any (garbled) fine powder some (garbled) clods together, and it’s hard to tell whether it’s a clod or a rock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Notice how you can kick it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. And it bounces and then (garbled).&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Reaching down is fairly easy. (Garbled) get my suit dirty at this stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: The mass of the backpack does have some effect in inertia. (Pause)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a slight tendency, I can see now, to (garbled) backwards due to the soft, very soft texture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re standing on a rock, a big rock there now. (Long pause)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After they lifted off from the moon and returned to the command module, Collins &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/20day6-reboard-lmjett.html"&gt;bombarded them with questions&lt;/a&gt; about what they’d seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: How was lift-off? How did lift-off feel?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, there was a little—little blast—then we started moving. Then we could see all those …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: [Garble] were you very stable? I mean, you just sort of floated up or was there a bunch of rattling around?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: … The floor came up to meet you. I think it multiplied g by [garble] it was about—at lift-off—maybe—half a g or two-thirds of a g.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, you know, well, just looking at that one sample, it was—I’m surprised you didn’t have a lot more dust. Now you saw dust during descent, I think, around 40 feet, something like that, 30 feet maybe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes it was …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: But its pattern is such that it sprays out horizontally, and it doesn’t really come up and engulf you, huh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: All the stuff looks like very light tan and gray, you know, that’s—that’s the color of it. When you get right up there to it, when you see it, why that isn’t the color at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Dark—battleship gray, isn’t it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: Maybe not—I don’t know …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, what kind of …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: … what stuck to the spacecraft, I think you can see afterwards …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you think it is from the—geology standpoint, is it basalt dust?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way home, they &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/23day7-tv-food-prep.html"&gt;put on some tunes&lt;/a&gt;. Armstrong picked this time: “Radar Blues,” a jazzy number that featured the ethereal sounds of a theremin. And, as with any road trip, not everyone enjoyed the selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Charlie Duke, in Mission Control]&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you, 11. We appreciate you turning that off. [Laughter.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Charlie, could you copy our music down there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duke&lt;/strong&gt;: Did we copy what, Neil?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you copy our music down there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duke&lt;/strong&gt;: Rog. We sure did. We’re wondering who selected—made your selections?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armstrong&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s an old favorite of mine, about—it’s an album made about 20 years ago, called &lt;em&gt;Music Out of the Moon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duke&lt;/strong&gt;: Roger. It sounded a little scratchy to us, Neil. Either that or your tape was a little slow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s supposed to sound that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duke&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s one of those …&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: … it sounds a little scratchy to us too, but the czar likes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one of their last meals in space, Collins, the mission comic, &lt;a href="http://https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/24day8-news-checks.html"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to poke some fun at the next crew that would make the same journey—Apollo 12. Their own dangerous reentry was still ahead, but they had completed the purpose of their mission, and they were almost home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Owen Garriott, in Mission Control]&lt;/strong&gt;: That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I’m way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Why don’t you get Milt to give you five minutes off and grab a hamburger?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garriott&lt;/strong&gt;: I suggested that a while ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. Got to keep the calories low, so I’d better stand by without it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Houston, Apollo 11. We—We’ve been doing a little flight planning for Apollo 12 up here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garriott&lt;/strong&gt;: Roger. Go ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re trying to calculate how much spaghetti and meatballs we can get on board for Al Bean [the lunar-module pilot for Apollo 12].&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garriott&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: It’ll be close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garriott&lt;/strong&gt;: 11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory baseline for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay. Thank you. That’s in work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, it was time to plunge through the atmosphere and parachute down to the Pacific Ocean. The crew members were &lt;a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/26day9-approach-earth.html"&gt;travel-weary&lt;/a&gt;, ready to sleep in their own beds and feel the gravity of their own planet. They took a good look at the moon behind them in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Fred Haise, in Mission Control]&lt;/strong&gt;: Apollo 11, Houston.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: Go ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haise&lt;/strong&gt;: Roger, Mike. We recommend the left VHF antenna for VHF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haise&lt;/strong&gt;: And this is your friendly backup CMP. Have a good trip, and [garbled] remember to come in BEF [blunt end forward].&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: You better believe. Thank you kindly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collins&lt;/strong&gt;: We can see the moon passing by the window and it looks what I consider to be a correct size.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marina Koren</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/marina-koren/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/KSC_69PC_429_orig/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>NASA</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Best Banter From Apollo 11</title><published>2019-07-20T12:47:35-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-22T11:52:16-04:00</updated><summary type="html">Between the high-stakes maneuvers, the crew joked around, listened to music, and drank way too much coffee.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-moon-landing-transcripts/594451/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594427</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It is difficult to imagine a more daunting task for a newspaper editor than planning the next day’s front page when the world has just witnessed humanity’s crowning achievement: the successful landing of two of its kind on an alien world. The headlines you write, the photos you place, the prose you edit—you are not simply working to sum up the immensity of the moment for morning commuters. The page you make will be hung on walls, folded into scrapbooks, passed onto grandchildren, and eventually stand in for even the most potent of human memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In July 1969, much of that job at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; fell to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/11/nyregion/11rosenthal.html"&gt;Abe Rosenthal&lt;/a&gt;, then the paper’s associate managing editor. (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/01/archives/editors-involved-in-changes-at-the-new-york-times-the-times-shifts.html?searchResultPosition=41"&gt;Less than two weeks later&lt;/a&gt;, he’d be named managing editor, at the time the paper’s top editorial position.) The design was handled by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/nyregion/louis-silverstein-times-art-director-dies-at-92.html"&gt;Louis Silverstein&lt;/a&gt;, the paper’s art director, who was called upon for layout duty “when a story of historic dimensions came along.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;They and other editors decided on a simple page topped by a single headline, the largest in &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; history to that point, “Men Walk on Moon,” followed by the dek: “Astronauts land on plain; collect rocks, plant flag.” (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._M._Rosenthal#Death"&gt;Rosenthal’s gravestone&lt;/a&gt; carries the epitaph &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;HE KEPT THE PAPER STRAIGHT&lt;/span&gt;, which apparently applied to his headlines too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/07/11/issue.html"&gt;standard eight-columns-across grid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/07/14/issue.html"&gt;parsimonious use of photography&lt;/a&gt; were set aside in favor of three huge photos (barely recognizable as the moon, one a photo of a television set carrying the CBS feed), flanked by just two wide columns of text. The main bar was written from Houston by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Noble_Wilford"&gt;John Noble Wilford&lt;/a&gt;, at the time a 35-year-old science reporter with the story assignment of 10 lifetimes. (It was “the great divide, the &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;. to &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;., in my journalism career,” he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/moon-neil-armstrong-nasa"&gt;would later recall&lt;/a&gt;.) His lede, like the headline, was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/science/apollo-11-john-noble-wilford.html"&gt;bracing and straight&lt;/a&gt;: “HOUSTON, Monday, July 21—Men have landed and walked on the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-moon-landing-site-today/594364/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What is the Apollo 11 site like now? &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But Rosenthal knew the occasion required something less direct than all that prose. What the moment demanded was a bit of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And that is the origin of the only other byline on the page, at lower left: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_MacLeish"&gt;Archibald MacLeish&lt;/a&gt;. One of America’s great polymaths, the poet, statesman, journalist, three-time Pulitzer Prize winner (and first curator of the &lt;a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/"&gt;Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, of which Nieman Lab is a part) was the person the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; chose to sum up the goggling achievement for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="909" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/nyt_apollo_11_front_page/4ed3083f4.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;The New YOrk Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacLeish had, aside from his infinite other qualifications, some prior experience in the reflections-on-moon-travel game. Seven months earlier, the astronauts of Apollo 8 had become, on Christmas Eve, the first humans to enter the moon’s orbit, only about 70 miles above the lunar surface. On that occasion, too, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; had turned to MacLeish, then 76 years of age and six years retired from his professorship at Harvard. He opted for prose rather than poetry that time, though; his words &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/25/archives/a-reflection-riders-on-earth-together-brothers-in-eternal-cold.html"&gt;ran under the headline&lt;/a&gt; “A Reflection: Riders on Earth Together, Brothers in Eternal Cold” and ranked Apollo’s perspective shift as a new Copernican revolution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men’s conception of themselves and of each other has always depended on their notion of the earth. When the earth was the World — all the world there was — and the stars were lights in Dante’s heaven, and the ground beneath men’s feet roofed Hell, they saw themselves as creatures at the center of the universe, the sole, particular concern of God — and from that high place they ruled and killed and conquered as they pleased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;And when, centuries later, the earth was no longer the World but a small, wet spinning planet in the solar system of a minor star off at the edge of an inconsiderable galaxy in the immeasurable distances of space — when Dante’s heaven had disappeared and there was no Hell (at least no Hell beneath the feet) — men began to see themselves not as God-directed actors at the center of a noble drama, but as helpless victims of a senseless farce where all the rest were helpless victims also and millions could be killed in world-wide wars or in blasted cities or in concentration camps without a thought or reason but the reason — if we call it one — of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, in the last few hours, the notion may have changed again. For the first time in all of time men have seen it not as continents or oceans from the little distance of a hundred miles or two or three, but seen it from the depth of space; seen it whole and round and beautiful and small as even Dante — that “first imagination of Christendom” — had never dreamed of seeing it; as the Twentieth Century philosophers of absurdity and despair were incapable of guessing that it might be seen. And seeing it so, one question came to the minds of those who looked at it. “Is it inhabited?” they said to each other and laughed — and then they did not laugh. What came to their minds a hundred thousand miles and more into space — “half way to the moon” they put it — what came to their minds was the life on that little, lonely, floating planet; that tiny raft in the enormous, empty night. “Is it inhabited?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The medieval notion of the earth put man at the center of everything. The nuclear notion of the earth put him nowhere — beyond the range of reason even — lost in absurdity and war. This latest notion may have other consequences. Formed as it was in the minds of heroic voyagers who were also men, it may remake our image of mankind. No longer that preposterous figure at the center, no longer that degraded and degrading victim off at the margins of reality and blind with blood, man may at last become himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold — brothers who know now they are truly brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/nasa/122568sci-nasa-macleish.html"&gt;The 503 words&lt;/a&gt; struck a chord in a nation struggling to extract itself from Vietnam and still reeling from assassinations and riots. When one of those astronauts, Frank Borman, returned to Earth and was asked to address Congress, he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/opinion/earth-space-christmas-eve-apollo-8.html"&gt;used MacLeish’s words in place of his own&lt;/a&gt;, calling himself an “unlikely poet, or no poet at all”: &lt;em&gt;brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold—brothers who know now that they are truly brothers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So the next year, when it was time to pare the immensity down to a few column inches, MacLeish got the call again. “What the poet wrote would count most,” Rosenthal &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/18/opinion/on-my-mind-standby-update-moon-poem.html"&gt;remembered 20 years later&lt;/a&gt;, “but we also wanted to say to our readers, look, this paper does not know how to express how it feels this day and perhaps you don’t either, so here is a fellow, a poet, who will try for all of us.” (He also noted that MacLeish—who had been hired on as a reporter at Henry Luce’s &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; magazine almost exactly 40 years earlier—had turned in his copy on time.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/most-compelling-photo-moon-landing/594274/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The most compelling photo of the moon landing&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Early press times for the first editions put MacLeish in the unusual position of deadline poet; he had to write before the actual landing occurred, meaning he had to write without knowing if the day brought triumph or tragedy. (Editors told him “to stand by to update the moon poem,” but in the end that proved unnecessary.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were &lt;a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/07/21/issue.html"&gt;the words MacLeish wrote&lt;/a&gt;. (You can also find them in his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KI0ESFOvi5QC&amp;amp;pg=PA17&amp;amp;dq=%22dazzle+of+silver+in+our+leaves%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQhrztv8HjAhXCT98KHSZRCs0Q6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22dazzle%20of%20silver%20in%20our%20leaves%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Collected Poems, 1917-1982&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1316" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/macleish_poem/2553bb381.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="credit"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Archibald MacLeish lived such an overstuffed life that, when he died in 1982, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/21/obituaries/archibald-macleish-is-dead-poet-and-playwright-was-89.html"&gt;his &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; obit&lt;/a&gt; didn’t even find space to note his brief role as national interpreter of wonders. Fifty years after “Voyage to the Moon,” in a fractured country, it seems impossible to imagine the sort of moment of communal awe Apollo 11 inspired. Almost as impossible as a poem running on the front page of &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. But there was a time, not that long ago, when journalism saw its limits, stepped aside, and let the moment sing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joshua Benton</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/joshua-benton/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><author><name>Nieman Lab</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/nieman-lab/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/earthrise_nasa/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>NASA</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">Sometimes Even Newspapers Need Poetry</title><published>2019-07-20T08:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-22T11:14:25-04:00</updated><summary type="html">&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; tapped a polymath poet to celebrate the 1969 moon landing on its front page.</summary><link href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/front-page-day-apollo-11-landed/594427/?utm_source=feed" rel="alternate" /></entry><entry><id>tag:theatlantic.com,2019:50-594370</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; This article is part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/apollo-11-moon-landing-anniversary"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apollo 11 mission, 50 years later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;With seconds left in the countdown, JoAnn Morgan knew there was no turning back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, we’re really going to do it&lt;/em&gt;, she thought to herself. &lt;em&gt;We’re really going&lt;/em&gt;. The United States was about to launch three men to the moon, and Morgan, an instrumentation controller at NASA, had a front-row seat: the launch-control room at Kennedy Space Center, where dozens of engineers guided the rocket carrying the Apollo 11 crew toward space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Morgan worked on the Apollo program as an engineer, checking and testing various ground systems required to prepare the rockets for takeoff. Each time, she had to leave the launch-control room about a half hour before liftoff and watch the launch from somewhere else. This was the 1960s; most of the NASA workforce was male and white, and women were not allowed to be at the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on launch day, a sweltering Wednesday in July, she was there. She was 28 at the time, and the memory of that day sticks vividly in her mind. She remembers the headset pressed to her ear, transmitting the final moments. She can feel her elbow vibrating against the arm of her chair from the shockwaves that washed over as the Saturn V climbed into the air. She can see the rocket in the window as it disappeared into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Morgan found out many years later that her supervisor had fought hard to get her into the room. He had told his superiors that he needed her there. Morgan was the best they had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap" dir="ltr"&gt;Three years before the moon landing, Morgan sat down at a console to conduct some tests. She was about to plug in her headset when she felt a hand whack her on the back. “We don’t have women in here,” the man behind her said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Morgan called the director of her team, Karl Sendler, who had ordered the tests. Sendler was one of the engineers who had come to the United States from Germany with Wernher von Braun, whose Nazi record was &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/chasing-moon-wernher-von-braun-and-nazis/"&gt;hidden from the public&lt;/a&gt; after World War II, to help build the Saturn V rocket that launched the Apollo crew. He told Morgan to ignore the guy and get to work, so she did. Later that afternoon, Rocco Petrone, the manager of the Apollo program, stopped by. “He sort of gently tapped me on the shoulder and he said, ‘JoAnn, you’re always welcome,’” Morgan told me recently. Her boss, she assumes, had made some calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was difficult for her to feel welcome at Kennedy, though. “It was 100 percent men every place I went,” Morgan said. Many were startled when the engineer “J. Morgan” walked into the room and turned out not to be a man. Most got over the surprise and worked amiably with her. Some didn’t. Morgan made friends with the secretaries and the librarian at the nearby Air Force base, a Filipino woman with a master’s degree, a rarity in her own right. When male employees made crass comments, Morgan confided in the center’s sole female lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Florida coast was its own solar system, with Cape Canaveral at its center, and many other women were there. Thousands of workers flocked to the area, bringing their families with them. Their lives, professional and social, gravitated around the space effort. The majority of women at Kennedy and other NASA centers in the 1950s and 1960s worked—or started out—as administrative assistants, typists, and, like Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and the other women whose stories were told in &lt;em&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/em&gt;, human computers calculating orbital mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/hidden-figures-and-the-appeal-of-math-in-an-age-of-inequality/513434/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: “Hidden Figures” and the appeal of math in an age of inequality&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The paucity of women was more apparent in technical fields such as engineering, where Morgan began her career. She joined the American space effort a decade before the Apollo 11 launch, as an intern right out of high school. NASA didn’t exist yet. Like most high-school kids in central Florida at the time, Morgan liked to go down to the beach at night to watch the Army launch rockets into the sky from nearby Cape Canaveral—they produced a spectacular light show if they blew up. Morgan watched the launch of Explorer 1, the first American satellite to reach space, and she remembers the astonishment she felt, learning that the satellite’s instruments had discovered bands of hazardous radiation curling around Earth. She marveled at the thought of sending something into space that could tell you about the world. “It was like a door opened in my mind,” Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At Jacksonville State University, she began studying math and spending summers interning at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which was absorbed into the nascent NASA. Her supervisor at the agency, Jim White, gave a speech to the engineers. They were to call their new trainee Ms. Hardin—her maiden name—and they would treat her like any other aspiring engineer. “Right away, the first week, somebody said, ‘Oh, can we have the student make coffee?’” Morgan recalled. White gave them another talk after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="448" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2019/07/082218_JoAnnMorgan_865/e8700a2ca.jpg" width="672"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;JoAnn Morgan today (Courtesy of KG Design)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan said her passion for the work provided enough insulation from workplace slights. Still, she tried to inoculate herself against unpleasant encounters. She didn’t ride the elevator alone with male colleagues she knew were likely to say something snarky or sleazy. She avoided climbing stairs while a man followed behind, aware that he was probably ogling her figure. Morgan reported some remarks to her supervisor. “I never knew what people did when I turned in those comments; I never got any feedback,” she said. “But sometimes things stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The phone calls were the worst. Nameless men would ring Morgan’s line on the console and say things that, to this day, she refuses to repeat. One day, a television operator approached her to ask if she was alright. He had been monitoring the launch-control room on his screen on another floor, and he’d seen Morgan slam the phone down, an “awful” look on her face. Morgan never reported these incidents. For decades, only two people knew about them: her husband, Larry, and that television operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Sendler, Morgan was the most skilled communicator on his team. Morgan remembers the German rocket scientist’s giddy expression when he took her hands in his and told her she’d be in the room for the Apollo 11 launch. Morgan was thrilled; she would no longer be shut out and she’d be working the day shift. (She had never liked the night shifts.) In the tense minutes before liftoff, Morgan monitored streams of information coming from the computer systems and the launchpad, and relayed the data to other engineers until the crew was cleared for flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When Apollo 11 was in the sky, Morgan and the other engineers in Cape Canaveral handed off the mission to their colleagues at Mission Control in Houston. Morgan wrapped up her work and packed for a vacation; she and Larry were going to take a boat out on the water. Four days later, they watched the grainy footage of Neil Armstrong stepping onto the lunar surface at a hotel, with champagne to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/michael-collins-moon-landing-apollo-11/594238/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Just leave Michael Collins alone&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That’s when it really hit her, Morgan said. The Apollo astronauts had made history, and as the only woman in the launch-control room during liftoff, she had, too. A photo of the Cape Canaveral control room on launch day, with Morgan in a navy dress amid a sea of white shirts and skinny ties, &lt;a href="https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/features/women-reflect-on-apollo/"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan said it wasn’t until the late 1970s that she started to notice she wasn’t alone in meetings anymore. More and more women were receiving technical degrees, and they were coming to NASA. She was delighted, especially as she moved into leadership positions at the agency. She was the supervisor now, and she would make them feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;There’s a wonderful scene in a recent Apollo 11 documentary comprising almost entirely video and audio excavated from untouched NASA archives. The camera sweeps around the control room. The dozens of engineers, with their pale faces and close-cropped hair and horn-rimmed glasses, blend together. And then there’s Morgan. She wears a light-blue, striped button-down shirt. Her hair is short and curled up at the ends, and her lips are colored pink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The sight, so incongruous with the rest of the setting, startled me. My body twitched involuntarily in the movie-theater chair. I felt like a time traveler; I wasn’t supposed to be there and shouldn’t make my presence known, but I knew something she didn’t. I wanted so badly to shout at Morgan on the screen, ‘There are going to be others like you!’ Someday, there would be other people in the control room—at NASA, in rocket science and all the other sciences—who were not men, not white, not the stereotypical figure that society had deemed as having the right stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The only woman in the control room eventually learned what I knew, watching her from the future. Morgan worked at NASA for 45 years before retiring in 2003 as &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/biographies/morgan.html"&gt;a senior executive&lt;/a&gt; at Kennedy Space Center. She was there through it all—the Apollo landings, the Voyager missions, the space-shuttle triumphs and tragedies, the first trips to Mars, the delicate construction of the International Space Station. And she saw the staff behind these missions shift. While NASA’s workforce is still &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/fy_2018_nasa_md-715_report_508.pdf"&gt;mostly male and white&lt;/a&gt;, the agency employs more women and people of color than ever before. As in many workplaces, sexual harassment likely remains intractable, but human-resource departments and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/533577main_45013-Anti-Harassment_Brochure-Final.pdf"&gt;procedures are in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/10/why-do-more-men-women-sexually-harass/572221/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Why men sexually harass women&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Morgan &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1993-11-14-9310270685-story.html"&gt;once&lt;/a&gt; said she would like to retire on Mars. She settled for Montana instead. Her summers are spent in the northwestern part of the state, in a house that overlooks a freshwater lake rimmed by snow-topped mountains and trees the color of malachite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The alpine wilderness provides respite from the hottest months in Florida, where she lives the rest of the year in a beachfront cottage, about an hour’s drive north of Cape Canaveral. Her stays in Montana have grown longer since Larry died in 2006. She likes to go into town for some music, and hike when her leg isn’t bothering her. She grows produce year-round: pineapple, papaya, and pomegranates in Florida; cherries, strawberries, raspberries, apples, and pears in Montana. Though she’s lived in Florida for decades, she has never lost the soothing lilt of her native Huntsville, Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The famous picture from the control room has followed her. Morgan said she has &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/67285main_aug25.pdf"&gt;many others like it&lt;/a&gt;, taken at meetings and medal ceremonies. She doesn’t want to see any more, whether she’s in them or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My wish would be, all the photos in the future, there will always be women,” she said. “Not just one woman—there will be women.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marina Koren</name><uri>http://www.theatlantic.com/author/marina-koren/?utm_source=feed</uri></author><media:content url="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/joannMorganFinal/lead_960.jpg"><media:credit>Joan Wong / Images courtesy of NASA</media:credit></media:content><title type="html">The Apollo Engineer Who Almost Wasn’t Allowed in the Control Room</title><published>2019-07-19T13:59:16-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-26T13:40:28-04:00</updated><summary type="html">JoAnn Morgan stood out against the sea of men in skinny ties and glasses.
