Everything else slated for iOS 13 could be pushed to a 13.1 update in late October (when I expect the new iPads to be announced).</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/27/everything-new-in-ios-13-1-beta-1/\">macrumors.com/2019/08/27/everything-new-in-ios-13-1-beta-1/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Some parties might have valid uses for\ntechniques that are also used for tracking.

We consider this to\nbe unintended impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Equating tracking with malware and security exploits is a major policy change, and absolutely correct. Notably, they are not respecting commercial interests <em>at all</em>. The user’s privacy comes first, and if there is commercial collateral damage from that, fuck it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>WebKit will do its best to <em>prevent</em> all covert tracking, and all\ncross-site tracking (even when it’s not covert). These goals apply\nto all types of tracking listed above, as well as tracking\ntechniques currently unknown to us.</p>\n\n<p>If a particular tracking technique cannot be completely prevented\nwithout undue user harm, WebKit will <em>limit the capability</em> of\nusing the technique. For example, limiting the time window for\ntracking or reducing the available bits of entropy — unique data\npoints that may be used to identify a user or a user’s behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hopefully, this will help close <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/07/superhuman_and_email_privacy\">the email tracking-pixel loophole as well</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The ball is now in Chrome’s court to follow suit.

But it’s\nalso aimed at keeping you locked into your iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>There are no paper statements with the digital-first Apple Card.\nUnlike a traditional credit card, everything is accessed through\nthe Wallet app on the iPhone, including transaction histories,\ntotal balances, previous statements, and payments. There’s no\nwebsite to view the latest transactions made on the card or make a\npayment if you lose access to that Wallet app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t think the reason for this is to keep you locked to your iPhone, although that’s certainly a side effect. I think this simply reflects Apple’s internal culture. Apple’s culture is to make native apps for everything as a first priority, with web interfaces as a much lower priority. And in recent years, that’s shifted from native apps for iOS and Mac to just native apps for iOS. (E.g. the craptacular Catalyst apps for Stocks, News, Voice Memos, and most <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1163601954360242178\">especially</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1163691403186249728\">Home</a>.) It feels ridiculous that you can’t access your Apple Card account from a Mac, whether from a native Mac app or from a website.</p>\n\n<p>In some ways making the iOS Wallet app the primary interface to your Apple Card probably makes for a great experience. (I haven’t signed up for one — yet? — so I can’t say firsthand.) But not having access from a desktop computer is severely limiting in ways. Nguyen focuses on the scenario of what happens if you only have access to one iOS device and lose it (or it breaks). That’s a legitimate scenario. But what about being able to, say, export your monthly and annual statements? Or being able to search?</p>\n\n<p>My hope is that Apple Card is only accessible via the iOS Wallet app <em>for now</em>, and that <a href=\"https://wallet.apple.com/\">wallet.apple.com</a> will eventually be a full-featured interface to your card account.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/nicolenguyen/apple-card-with-lost-misplaced-or-stolen-iphone\">buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/nicolenguyen/apple-card-with-lost…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Admirable.</p>\n\n<p>Mullenweg’s remarks on the influence of app stores — and I think it’s pretty clear he was largely talking about Apple’s, and that he talked about them in the general lowercase sense so as not to come across as impolitic — was rather eye-opening. Automattic pretty much embodies the ideal of a for-profit company that fully embraces the open web. Their core product, WordPress, is and always has been fully open source.

         "content_html" : "\n<p>Three weeks ago, writing for The Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings\">Alex Hern reported</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple contractors regularly hear confidential medical information,\ndrug deals, and recordings of couples having sex, as part of their\njob providing quality control, or “grading”, the company’s Siri\nvoice assistant, the Guardian has learned.</p>\n\n<p>Although Apple does not explicitly disclose it in its\nconsumer-facing privacy documentation, a small proportion of Siri\nrecordings are passed on to contractors working for the company\naround the world. They are tasked with grading the responses on a\nvariety of factors, including whether the activation of the voice\nassistant was deliberate or accidental, whether the query was\nsomething Siri could be expected to help with and whether Siri’s\nresponse was appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Apple says the data “is used to help Siri and dictation …\nunderstand you better and recognise what you say”.</p>\n\n<p>But the company does not explicitly state that that work is\nundertaken by humans who listen to the pseudonymised recordings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I pooh-poohed this story at first, mostly on the grounds that I thought we knew about this, and that the recordings were only saved from users who had consented to it. I was mistaken. This is a privacy fiasco, and a betrayal of Siri users’ trust.</p>\n\n<p>A week later, Apple issued statements to TechCrunch and The Verge stating that it was suspending this “grading” program. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/apple-suspends-siri-response-grading-in-response-to-privacy-concerns/\">From Matthew Panzarino’s report at TechCrunch</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple says it will review the process that it uses, called\ngrading, to determine whether Siri is hearing queries correctly,\nor being invoked by mistake.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it will be issuing a software update in the future\nthat will let Siri users choose whether they participate in the\ngrading process or not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My reading of this is that until last week, if you used Siri in any way, your recordings might be used in this “grading” process. If I graded Apple on the privacy and trust implications of this, I’d give them an F. I don’t think it’s debatable whether users of <em>any</em> voice assistant should have their recordings listened to or even reviewed (in text form) by human employees without their express consent. But especially users of Siri, given Apple’s prominent position as a privacy focused company. <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/\">Apple literally advertises on the basis of its user-focused privacy policies</a> — but apparently the billboards should have read “What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone, except for some of your Siri recordings, which we listen to.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20751270/apple-stops-contractors-siri-voice-recordings-privacy-opt-out\">From Sam Byford’s report for The Verge</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple did not comment on whether, in addition to pausing the\nprogram where contractors listen to Siri voice recordings, it\nwould also stop actually saving those recordings on its servers.\nCurrently the company says it keeps recordings for six months\nbefore removing identifying information from a copy that it could\nkeep for two years or more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Until the opt-in process is crystal clear, Apple should delete all existing recordings and confirm that it is no longer saving them. I don’t even know where to start with the fact that until this story broke, they were keeping copies <em>with identifying information</em> for six months. This defies everyone’s expectations of privacy for a voice assistant.</p>\n\n<p>We should expect Apple to lead the industry on this front, but in fact, they’re far behind. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=kinw_myk_alxa_faq_us?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=201602230&amp;pop-up=1\">Amazon has a FAQ</a> written in plain language that explains how Alexa works, and how to view your voice recordings from Alexa-powered devices. You can review them in the Alexa app in Settings: Alexa Privacy (a pretty obvious location) or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings\">on the web</a>. That settings page also has an option: “Use Voice Recordings to Improve Amazon Services and to Develop New Features”. I think Amazon should make clear that with this turned on, some of your recordings may be listened to by Amazon employees, but it’s not too hard to surmise that’s what’s going on.</p>\n\n<p>Apple offers no such setting, and offers absolutely no way to know which, if any, of our Siri recordings have been saved for review by employees. This is something we should have explicit, precise control over, but instead it’s a completely black box we have no control over or insight into whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>From a privacy perspective, there are two fundamental types of Siri interactions: purposeful and accidental. Purposeful interactions are when you press the side button or say “Hey Siri” with the intention of invoking Siri. Accidental interactions occur when the button is pressed too long accidentally, or when a device incorrectly hears “Hey Siri” even though you said no such thing. All recorded Siri interactions should be treated by Apple with extraordinary care, but accidental invocations, when identified, should be deleted immediately unless the user has expressly agreed to allow it — <em>each and every time</em>. Having Apple contractors listen to random conversations or audio is the nightmare scenario for an always-listening voice assistant.</p>\n\n<p>Compare and contrast with iOS’s transcript feature for voicemail. At the bottom of each transcription, iOS asks whether the transcription was “useful” or “not useful”. Tap on either of those and you get a very explicit prompt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Help Improve Transcriptions?</p>\n\n<p>Would you like to submit this voicemail to Apple to improve\ntranscription accuracy?</p>\n\n<p>Recordings will only be used to improve the quality of speech\nrecognition in Apple products.</p>\n\n<p>Do not submit recordings if you believe the speaker would be\nuncomfortable with you submitting the content to Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The two buttons at the bottom of the prompt: Cancel and Submit. You must address this same prompt every single time you flag a transcription as useful or not useful. Every time. That’s how you do it.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to being correctly respectful of privacy, the voicemail transcription feature also puts the user in control. So when a voicemail is transcribed poorly, you can flag it and submit it to Apple. That would be a great feature for Siri — when an interaction goes poorly, and we know the interaction was innocuous in terms of revealing anything private, we should be able to flag it and submit it to Apple. I firmly believe that Siri has gotten far more useful and far more accurate in the last few years, but clearly it’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/1073723442179031041\">still very far from perfect</a>. I’d be happy to help Apple by submitting failed interactions <em>on a per-interaction basis</em>. Apple needs to stop pretending Siri is perfect.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll give the final word to Steve Jobs, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/d8-steve-jobs-onstage-full-length-video/70F7CC1D-FFBF-4BE0-BFF1-08C300E31E11.html\">speaking about privacy back in 2010 at Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg’s D8 conference</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain\nEnglish and repeatedly. I believe people are smart and some people\nwant to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them\nevery time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get\ntired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re\ngoing to do with their data.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can’t say it any better than that.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

But at a basic level there is a clear difference: the <em>interface</em> might be well designed and clear, but if it is slow and laggy, the <em>experience</em> of using it will be unpleasant, and people will go out of their way to avoid using whatever it is.</p>\n\n<p>I repeat this point often, but it’s a moral obligation for designers to keep in mind what users <em>will</em> do, not what they “<em>should</em>” do.

Or was it?</p>\n\n<p>It took <a href=\"https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/06/superhuman-is-spying-on-you\">an article I almost didn’t publish</a> and tens of\nthousands of people <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmikeindustries.com%2Fblog%2Farchive%2F2019%2F06%2Fsuperhuman-is-spying-on-you&amp;src=typed_query\">saying they were creeped out</a>, but\nSuperhuman <a href=\"https://blog.superhuman.com/read-statuses-bdf0cc34b6a5\">admitted they were wrong and reduced the danger that\ntheir surveillance pixels introduce</a>. Good on Rahul Vohra and\nteam for that.</p>\n\n<p>I will say, however, that I’m a little surprised how quickly some\npeople are rolling over and giving Superhuman credit for fixing a\nproblem that they didn’t actually fix. From tech press articles\nimplying that the company quickly closed all of its privacy\nissues, to friends sending me nice notes, I don’t think people are\npaying close enough attention here. This is not “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Accomplished_speech\">Mission\nAccomplished</a>” for ethical product design or privacy — at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you haven’t been following this saga from earlier this month, it’s well worth your time to read the whole thing, including <a href=\"https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2019/06/superhuman-is-spying-on-you\">Davidson’s original post</a> and Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra’s genuinely thoughtful — but ultimately unsatisfying — <a href=\"https://blog.superhuman.com/read-statuses-bdf0cc34b6a5\">response</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, Superhuman is an invitation-only Gmail front-end whose users seem to genuinely love it. But they embed tracking pixels in emails by default, and use these pixels to show the sender when (and until last week, <em>where</em>, which is truly fucked up) the recipient views them. They call them “read receipts”, and functionally they do work like read receipts, insofar as they indicate when you read a message. But real email read receipts are under the <em>recipient’s</em> control, and they’re a simple binary flag, read or unread — they don’t tell the sender how many times or when you view a message.</p>\n\n<p>I know that mailing list software generally includes tracking pixels. I don’t think that’s ethical either. On a personal level, though, with Superhuman, tracking when and how many times a recipient views a message is simply absurdly wrong.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also something the vast, overwhelming majority of people don’t even realize is possible. I’ve told the basic Superhuman tracking story to a few people over the last few weeks, and asked whether they realized this was possible; all of them expressed shock and many of them outrage as well. Email should be private, <em>and most people assume, incorrectly, that it is</em>. You have to be a web developer of some sort to understand how this is possible. Email is supposed to be like paper mail — you send it, they get it, and you have no idea whether they read it or not. It bounces back to you if they never even receive it, say, because you addressed it incorrectly. The original conception of email is completely private.</p>\n\n<p>But also, the original conception of email is that messages are plain text. No fonts, no styles, just plain text, with optional attachments. But those attachments are embedded in the message, not pulled from a server when the message is viewed. </p>\n\n<p>Once we allowed email clients to act as de facto web browsers, loading remote content from servers when messages are viewed, we opened up not just a can of worms but an entire case of canned worms. Every privacy exploit for a web browser is now a privacy exploit for email. But it’s worse, because people naturally assume that email is completely private. </p>\n\n<p>Read receipts should be under the control of the recipient, not the sender. Full stop. The strength of email is that it is open and decentralized, but that’s email’s weakness too. No closed messaging platform that I’m aware of allows for read receipts that are controlled by the sender, not the recipient.</p>\n\n<p>I think Superhuman should be ashamed of themselves for building this feature in the first place — particularly the geo-tracking. But ultimately, <em>email clients should defend against this</em>. The fact that this nonconsensual tracking is even possible should be treated as a serious bug in all email clients. Apple Mail — both on Mac and iOS — allows you to disable loading of remote images as a preference, but that breaks most graphically rich emails. Mail clients should allow remote images but load them anonymously, through a proxy server perhaps. I’m sure it’s a tricky problem to solve, but I’m convinced it can be solved.</p>\n\n<p>Email should be every bit as private as people assume that it is.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karanlyons/status/1150774640899317760\">a report published today</a>, security researcher\nKaran Lyons shows that the same flaw — which gave attackers easy\naccess to laptop cameras and microphones — affects RingCentral,\nwhich is used by over 350,000 businesses, as well as Zhumu,\nessentially the Chinese version of Zoom.</p>\n\n<p>On July 16, Apple confirmed that it had released another silent\nupdate to Macs patching the vulnerability affecting Zoom’s partner\napps. The update, which went out this morning, requires no user\naction, but may take some time to roll out to all impacted Macs.\nLyons tweeted that Apple’s latest update takes action on 11\ndifferent apps, all vulnerable to the Zoom webcam flaw.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So here’s an interesting question. I’ve <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/10/nguyen-zoom\">been</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/11/macos-zoom-update\">using</a> the phrase “nonconsensual technology” to describe Zoom’s invisible web server that remained installed and running even after you deleted the Zoom app. But when Apple first issued a silent, emergency system update to remove Zoom’s software, a few DF readers emailed or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/braz/status/1149453237843582978\">tweeted</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwa4/status/1149675707016105985\">to ask</a>: <em>Isn’t this “nonconsensual technology” too?</em></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the answer sounds like yes at first. Users get no indication of the update, and “requires no user action” makes it sound like it’s mandatory. But there <em>is</em> a setting to control this, allowing Mac users to disable the automatic installation of such updates. On MacOS 10.14 Mojave, it’s in System Prefs → Software Update → Advanced (<a href=\"/misc/2019/07/macos-10-14-system-prefs.png\">screenshot</a>); on 10.13 High Sierra, it’s in System Prefs → App Store (<a href=\"/misc/2019/07/macos-10-13-system-prefs.png\">screenshot</a>). In both versions, the checkbox is labeled “Install system data files and security updates”, and resides at the bottom of the section that controls what gets installed automatically.</p>\n\n<p>This option is enabled by default — even if you choose to install regular system updates manually — which is why the vast majority of Mac users are getting these “silent” updates automatically. But if you disable this option, even these silent updates won’t be installed automatically. I confirmed this with an Apple spokesperson, who emphasized that Apple only issues such updates “extremely judiciously”. Any pending security updates will be installed the next time you manually update software.</p>\n\n<p>I think Apple has struck a nearly perfect balance here, between doing what’s right for most users (installing these rare emergency updates automatically) and doing what’s right for power users who really do want to control when updates — even essential ones — are installed. I also think Apple is doing the right thing by going to the press and explaining when they issue such updates. If I could tweak anything, it would be to have these updates show up in the regular list of pending software updates <em>if</em> you have “Install system data files and security updates” turned off.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/15/word-1-billion\">Speaking of</a> Microsoft and mobile, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715202/microsoft-bill-gates-android-biggest-mistake-interview\">this story caught my eye a few weeks ago</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has been reflecting on his time at\nthe company when crucial decisions were made over its mobile\noperating system. During a recent interview at Village Global, a\nventure capital firm, Gates revealed his “greatest mistake ever”\nwas Microsoft missing the Android opportunity:</p>\n\n<p>“In the software world, particularly for platforms, these are\nwinner-take-all markets. So the greatest mistake ever is whatever\nmismanagement I engaged in that caused Microsoft not to be what\nAndroid is. That is, Android is the standard non-Apple phone\nplatform. That was a natural thing for Microsoft to win. It really\nis winner take all. If you’re there with half as many apps or 90\npercent as many apps, you’re on your way to complete doom. There’s\nroom for exactly one non-Apple operating system and what’s that\nworth? $400 billion that would be transferred from company G to\ncompany M.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A lot of the response to this has focused — correctly — on the antitrust implications of Gates’s “winner takes all” acknowledgement. Nilay Patel had a strong take: “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18715702/bill-gates-regulate-platforms-network-effect-android-mistake-microsoft\">Bill Gates Accidentally Makes the Case to Regulate the Hell Out of Platform Companies</a>”.<sup id=\"fnr1-2019-07-15\"><a href=\"#fn1-2019-07-15\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>But I’m fascinated by the way he phrased the opportunity that Google seized with Android: to be “the standard non-Apple phone platform”. It’s just assumed in his thinking that the iPhone would have been the iPhone no matter what. Historically, that sounds bananas coming out of Bill Gates’s mouth.</p>\n\n<p>You can make a strong case, too, that Apple might not have survived its 1996-97 nadir without Microsoft’s support. I’ve always felt <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech-0806/\">the $150 million investment in Apple</a> that Microsoft made in 1997 was overrated. It just wasn’t <em>that</em> much money, even for Apple at that time.<sup id=\"fnr2-2019-07-15\"><a href=\"#fn2-2019-07-15\">2</a></sup> It was symbolic theater — and it worked. The value for Apple wasn’t the money itself but the public show of confidence from Microsoft — the message that Microsoft was supporting Apple, not trying to crush them.</p>\n\n<p>But the real benefit for Apple — the factor that I think truly helped save the company — was securing a promise that Microsoft would continue to work on Office for Mac for at least another five years. And it wasn’t just token “support” — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_98_Macintosh_Edition\">Office 98 for Mac</a> was a major update and <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rick_schaut/2004/02/26/mac-word-6-0/\">truly improved the Mac-like-ness of the apps</a>. Here we are 22 years later and the Office for Mac apps are chart-toppers in the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think it’s hyperbole to argue that the Mac probably wouldn’t have survived without Office, and possibly without a <em>good</em> version of Office. And in 1997 Apple wouldn’t have survived if the Mac platform hadn’t made a resurgence. Apple’s own iWork suite — Pages, Numbers, Keynote — didn’t ship until 2005. Microsoft Office singlehandedly kept the Mac a credible platform for classic productivity apps for 8 years.</p>\n\n<p>There were other third-party developers that Apple was dependent upon back then. Adobe certainly comes to mind — Apple needed the graphic design and illustration market, and that required (and still does require) Adobe’s pro apps. But it was never in Adobe’s interest <em>not</em> to continue supporting the Mac. If anything, it was in Adobe’s own interest to see the Mac thrive so that Adobe wouldn’t be dependent solely upon Microsoft and Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft, of course, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.\">had some serious antitrust problems in the ’90s</a>. If not for U.S. v. Microsoft, though, I wonder whether Gates would’ve chosen to drop Office for Mac and let Apple wither. I’m not saying anyone could have or should have predicted the iPhone and Apple’s dominance of mobile profits all the way back in 1997. Nobody really predicted what the iPhone would be in 2007, even. But if Microsoft had an inkling of what the iPhone would become, and where Android would come in and take over as, in Gates’s own words, “the standard non-Apple phone platform” by fast-following the iPhone’s basic all-display, all-multitouch design, maybe they’d have thought differently about helping Apple recover in 1997. With no Office 98, there might not have been an Apple to even make the iPhone in 2007. And <a href=\"https://www.technobuffalo.com/android-before-and-after-the-iphone\">with no iPhone in 2007</a> it’s impossible to say what the mobile phone state of the art would look like today. Without the iPhone, I think there’s a chance the mobile market would have continued on the same course it was on before the iPhone: dominated by crap software and BlackBerry-style hardware, with the carriers calling the shots. In that world, Microsoft might’ve had a chance.</p>\n\n<p>If losing the mobile market to Android was Gates’s biggest mistake, you can argue it started when he agreed to support Apple and the Mac in 1997.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2019-07-15\">\n<p>I’d be curious to hear Gates’s take on the console market, where there are <em>two</em> longstanding platforms — PlayStation and Xbox — sharing the non-Nintendo segment of the market. (Clearly Nintendo is the Apple of gaming.) With better licensing terms (Android being free of charge and open source was a huge boon compared to Microsoft’s mobile licensing) and a faster follow on an iPhone-inspired design, I’m not convinced that Windows Phone could not have been Xbox to Android’s Playstation.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2019-07-15\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2019-07-15\">\n<p>Microsoft sold its Apple shares in 2003. If they’d held onto them for another decade <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/20/what-ever-became-of-microsofts-150-million-investment-in-apple/\">they would’ve made $20-30 billion</a>.

I thought it was a great little interview — far more condensed than <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2019/06/30/ep-256\">my own podcast</a>, and with a full transcript to boot.</p>\n\n<p>One key point that I missed <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/06/jony_ive_leaves_apple\">in my first take on Ive’s departure</a> is that having design chiefs Evans Hankey (Industrial Design) and Alan Dye (Human Interface Design) report directly to COO Jeff Williams <em>does</em> make sense organizationally. What I had missed is that coincident with the announcement of Ive’s departure, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/leadership/sabih-khan/\">Apple promoted Sabih Khan to senior vice president of operations</a>. Apple hasn’t had an SVP of operations since Jeff Williams held the title, back when Tim Cook was COO under Steve Jobs. Back then Williams ran operations while Cook ran the company and Jobs devoted his remaining time to new products.</p>\n\n<p>Williams still holds the title COO, but titles don’t mean much at Apple. <em>Rank</em> matters, of course, and SVP is an elite level at Apple — <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/leadership/sabih-khan/\">there are only 13 executives at that level</a>, and one of them is still Jony Ive. But the literal titles don’t necessarily describe what executives do. Eddy Cue’s title — senior vice president of internet software and services — comes to mind. I don’t know where one would begin crafting a succinct title that accurately describes Cue’s domain, but that’s not it. That just doesn’t matter at Apple.</p>\n\n<p>This means Sabih Khan is running operations now. Jeff Williams’s title hasn’t changed, but he’s effectively now running product development. He’s led the Apple Watch product team from its inception; now I think he’s overseeing product for everything. Cook and Williams <em>did</em> run operations while holding the COO title, but what “COO” really means at Apple is “second in command”. Tim Cook didn’t move design under operations; he promoted Williams to a new position, effectively “chief product officer”, and as such it makes sense that Hankey and Dye would report to him.</p>\n\n<p>Only time will tell if that’s a better structure than replacing Jony Ive with a new chief design officer. But I feel a lot better about it than I did last week when the news broke.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

While he pursues personal projects, Ive in\nhis new company will continue to work closely and on a range of\nprojects with Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First: <em>Wow</em>. There’ve been rumors for years that Ive had one foot out the door, that his last real interest at Apple was designing Apple Park, not Apple products. But it’s something else to see it. This angle that he’s still going to work with Apple as an independent design firm seems like pure spin. You’re either at Apple or you’re not. Ive is out. </p>\n\n<p>Second: This dropped like a bomb. As far as I can tell <em>no one</em> in the media got a heads up about this news. Ever since Steve Jobs died it’s seemed to me that Ive ran his own media interaction.</p>\n\n<p>Third: This may be <em>good</em> news. Ive is, to state the obvious, preternaturally talented. But in the post-Jobs era, with all of Apple design, hardware and software, under his control, we’ve seen the software design decline and the hardware go wonky. I don’t know the inside story, but it certainly seems like a good bet that the MacBook keyboard fiasco we’re still in the midst of is the direct result of Jony Ive’s obsession with device thinness and minimalism. Today’s MacBooks are worse computers but more beautiful devices than the ones they replaced. Is that directly attributable to Jony Ive? With these keyboards in particular, I believe the answer is yes.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth: Apple’s hardware and industrial design teams work so far out that, even if I’m right and Ive is now effectively out of Apple, we’ll still be seeing Ive-designed hardware 5 years from now. It is going to take a long time to evaluate his absence.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth: Fuck this “sir” shit. We don’t have titles in the United States.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Jony is a singular figure in the design world and his role in\nApple’s revival cannot be overstated, from 1998’s groundbreaking\niMac to the iPhone and the unprecedented ambition of Apple Park,\nwhere recently he has been putting so much of his energy and\ncare,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Apple will continue to benefit\nfrom Jony’s talents by working directly with him on exclusive\nprojects, and through the ongoing work of the brilliant and\npassionate design team he has built. After so many years working\nclosely together, I’m happy that our relationship continues to\nevolve and I look forward to working with Jony long into the\nfuture.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: He’s gone.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Design team leaders Evans Hankey, vice president of Industrial\nDesign, and Alan Dye, vice president of Human Interface Design,\nwill report to Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This organizational structure makes no sense to me.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve never been an “Apple is doomed without Steve Jobs” person. But part of what made Apple the Apple we know in the post-1997 era is that when Jobs was at the helm, <em>all</em> design decisions were going through someone with great taste. Not perfect taste, but great taste. But the other part of what made Jobs such a great leader is that he could recognize bad decisions, sooner rather than later, and get them fixed.</p>\n\n<p>I think Tim Cook is a great CEO and Jeff Williams is a great COO. But who’s in charge of product design now? There is no new chief design officer, which, really, is what Steve Jobs always was. From a product standpoint, the post-Jobs era at Apple has been the Jony Ive era, not the Tim Cook era. That’s <em>not</em> a knock on Tim Cook. To his credit, Tim Cook has <em>never</em> pretended to be a product guy, which is exactly the hubris that John Sculley succumbed to back in the early ’90s, leading to the Newton being launched far before it was ready and the Macintosh platform languishing.</p>\n\n<p>My gut sense for years has been that Ive without Jobs has been like McCartney without Lennon. Or Lennon without McCartney — take whichever analogical pairing you prefer. My point here is only that the fruit of their collaborations were, seemingly magically, far greater than the sums of the duos’ talents and tastes.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I do know — which Cook alludes to in his statement above, and which I think was made crystal clear in <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come\">Ian Parker’s extraordinary 2015 profile of Ive in The New Yorker</a>, which is, in my opinion, the most insightful piece ever written about post-Jobs Apple — is that Jony Ive had moved beyond designing computers. And let’s be clear: the entire point of Apple has always been and should always remain designing computers. Everything they make is a computer. Their genius in recent years has been making things that don’t seem like computers but really are computers. Apple Watch is a computer. AirPods are computers. We’ve got computers — excellent computers — in our fucking ears. That’s Apple.</p>\n\n<p>But Ive’s attention turned more toward architecture. Apple Park is going to be a 100-year testimony to Jony Ive’s design. And it’s fascinating to me that Ive is leaving Apple with a single typeface — San Francisco — that the company now uses for <em>everything</em>. It’s the system font for every platform. It’s the only font they use for advertising and packaging. Type choices under Steve Jobs were excellent, but always a little ad hoc. Myriad for advertising and packaging, Lucida Grande for Mac OS X, Helvetica for the iPhone. I think it’s safe to say that Steve Jobs was far less rigorous than Jony Ive. The rigor necessary to develop a single type family that can work for everything from a digital watch face to a 100-foot billboard advertisement is extraordinary. And Ive has also brought that rigorous consistency to Apple’s architecture. Their new campus and their new retail stores are of the same design language — lighting, materials, furniture.</p>\n\n<p>But Apple doesn’t need a chief architect. They’re only going to build one Apple Park and it’s already been done.</p>\n\n<p>It makes me queasy to see that Apple’s chief designers are now reporting to operations. This makes no more sense to me than having them report to the LLVM compiler team in the Xcode group. Again, nothing against Jeff Williams, nothing against the LLVM team, but someone needs to be in charge of design for Apple to be Apple and I can’t see how that comes from operations. I don’t think that “chief design officer” should have been a one-off title created just for Jony Ive. Not just for Apple, <em>but especially at Apple</em>, it should be a permanent C-level title. I don’t think Ive ever should have been put in control of software design, but at least he is a designer.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t worry that Apple is in trouble because Jony Ive is leaving; I worry that Apple is in trouble because he’s not being replaced.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
