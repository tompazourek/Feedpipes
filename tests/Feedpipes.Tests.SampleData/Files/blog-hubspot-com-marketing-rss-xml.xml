 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29449/how-to-create-a-qr-code-in-4-quick-steps.aspx" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-make-a-qr-code.jpg" alt="how-to-make-a-qr-code" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;"Really? We're talking about QR codes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #33475b;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;"Really? We're talking about QR codes?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fair reaction. For several years now, QR codes have been at the center of the popular "___ is dead" trope we marketers love to argue when talking technology. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/qr-codes-dead"&gt;We've even debated it ourselves on this blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But if there's one thing the QR code debate shows you, it's that there sure isn't a consensus&amp;nbsp;-- the efficacy of QR codes still hotly contested.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there's no denying the popularity and convenience of the QR code. Keep reading to learn how to create your own QR code, and how you can encourage your customers to scan them when they come across your content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;What Is a QR Code?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;QR codes, short for "quick response" codes, are square-shaped black-and-white symbols that people can scan using a smartphone to learn more about a product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These encrypted squares can hold links, coupons, event details, and other information that users might want to take with them for referring to later.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;QR codes usually look something like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2457427390-jpg/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/qr-code.jpg?width=381&amp;amp;name=qr-code.jpg" alt="qr-code" width="381" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 381px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although not every QR code is shaped like a perfect square, they're most often found looking like the image above -- with varying patterns displayed inside. You'll often find them on direct mail, signage, billboards, and even commercials where you can quickly scan the code on the screen using your phone.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;QR Codes vs. Barcodes&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Does the rise of QR codes mean traditional barcodes are a thing of the past? Of course not. Traditional barcodes are still a common way for businesses to identify consumer packaged goods (CPGs) and manage their product inventory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/barcode%20example.png?width=229&amp;amp;name=barcode%20example.png" alt="Barcode example" width="229" style="width: 229px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/qr-code-example.png?width=166&amp;amp;name=qr-code-example.png" alt="QR code example" width="166" style="width: 166px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;"&gt;Images via &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Barcode_EAN8.svg" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;"&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QR_code_Wikimedia_Commons_(URL).png" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of differences between barcodes and QR codes -- both in their uses and their characteristics. Here are three important differences:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;QR Codes Are Shaped Differently&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barcodes&lt;/strong&gt; are typically rectangular in shape, requiring scanning devices to read the barcode's data horizontally. &lt;strong&gt;QR codes&lt;/strong&gt; are often square-shaped, displaying their data vertically&lt;em&gt; or&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;horizontally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color: #33475b;"&gt;QR Codes Hold More Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Due to a QR code's square shape, it can hold much more data than a barcode. In fact, QR codes can hold hundreds of times more encrypted characters than a barcode.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;QR Codes Hold Different Data&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;QR codes are often used differently than barcodes. &lt;strong&gt;Barcodes&lt;/strong&gt; hold key product information at the point of sale, such as the price and name of the manufacturer. &lt;strong&gt;QR codes&lt;/strong&gt; offer more passive and intangible information, such as location data and URLs to promotions and product landing pages.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How Do QR Codes Work?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Originally designed in Japan for the automotive industry, marketers adopted the barcodes because of their large storage capacity and ability to translate additional information to consumers beyond what creative and/or packaging&amp;nbsp;could convey.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If a consumer sees a QR code somewhere, they can take out their mobile device, download a free QR code scanning app, and "scan" the barcode to gain access to additional information, like so:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2458952239-jpg/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/scan-qr-code.jpg?width=669&amp;amp;name=scan-qr-code.jpg" alt="Person scanning QR code with a scanning mobile app" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;So if you wanted to create, say, a bus stop advertisement promoting your podcast, you could display a QR code on that printed ad that brings people right to your iTunes page when they scan it with their phones. Pretty simple, right?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;How to Make&amp;nbsp;a QR Code&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The QR code creation process is pretty straightforward. Here's how to get started.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1:&amp;nbsp;Select&amp;nbsp;a QR code generator.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are&amp;nbsp;tons of QR code generators out there. The best ones give you many options for using your QR code, and compatibility with most mobile QR code reader apps.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;Best QR Code Generators&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Kaywa&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;GOQR.me&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Free QR Code Generator by Shopify&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Visualead&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;The-qrcode-generator.com&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;QR Stuff&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;qr-code-generator.com&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;QR Code Monkey&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Create QR Code by Google App Engine&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Other things to look for when choosing a QR code generator are whether you can track and analyze performance, and if it allows you to design a code that's unique to your brand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some QR codes, for example, display logos and other icons within the code that immediately tell people what information they'll get from scanning it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Choose the type of content you're promoting.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let's select one of the QR code generators above and do a walk-through together. I'll select &lt;a href="https://www.qr-code-generator.com/"&gt;qr-code-generator.com&lt;/a&gt;, one of the eight preferred QR code generators above.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First, select what type of content you want your QR code to show the person after they scan it. You can choose from one of 10 types, as shown in the screenshot below. For our purposes, we'll promote a URL that directs users to our podcast.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/qr%20code%20generator%20types%20of%20content.png?width=690&amp;amp;name=qr%20code%20generator%20types%20of%20content.png" alt="Icons detailing types of content a QR code generator can promote" width="690" style="width: 690px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Enter your data in the form that appears.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you select the type of content you're promoting with this QR code, a field or form will appear where you can enter the information that corresponds with your campaign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want your QR code to save contact information, for example, you'll see a set of fields where you can enter your email address, subject line, and associated message.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To save a link to our podcast, we'll simply enter the URL in the field that appears, like so:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/qr%20code%20url%20form.png?width=690&amp;amp;name=qr%20code%20url%20form.png" alt="QR code URL form" width="690" style="width: 690px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 4: Consider downloading a dynamic QR code.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the option below for "dynamic"? One significant pitfall to making a QR code is that you can't edit the data it contains once you print it. But with dynamic QR codes, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; edit this data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dynamic%20qr%20code%20generator.png?width=690&amp;amp;name=dynamic%20qr%20code%20generator.png" alt="Dynamic QR code generator" width="690" style="width: 690px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With a free membership to QR code generators like qr-code-generator.com, you can print a dynamic QR code, scan it, and pull up an editable form where you can modify the data your visitors will receive when they scan the QR code themselves.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 5. Customize it.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The fun part of creating QR codes is customizing the design of the codes to your brand. Want your code to look like your logo? Go for it. Want it to reflect your website's design scheme? No&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using qr-code-generator.com, we can customize our QR code by clicking the button to the top-right, as shown in the screenshot below. Keep in mind not every QR code maker offers this design option -- depending on the QR code you're looking to generate, you might find some tools limited in their functionality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/customize%20qr%20code.png?width=399&amp;amp;name=customize%20qr%20code.png" alt="Customize your QR code with a logo" width="399" style="width: 399px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Of course, you can customize your QR code further -- adjusting the colors, adding a logo, creating social options, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Keep in mind, however, that some customizations can make it more difficult for QR code scanning apps to properly read the code. It's a good idea to generate two versions of your QR code -- one plain version and another with your preferred design.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 6:&amp;nbsp;Test the QR code to make sure it scans.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because a customized QR code can make it difficult for some mobile apps to "read," don't forget to check to see if the QR code reads correctly, and be sure to try more than just one reader. A good place to start is the free tool &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/#text"&gt;Google Goggles&lt;/a&gt;, which takes a picture and then tells you what link or item it “reads to.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another great free tool is &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qr-code-reader-and-scanner/id388175979?mt=8"&gt;QR Code Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically takes you to whatever it “reads.”&amp;nbsp;Apple's &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204003"&gt;Passbook&lt;/a&gt; also offers a built-in QR code reader on iOS 7, so you should test to make sure your code is readable there, as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 7: Share and distribute the QR code.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A QR code won't be able to do its job unless its seen. So make sure you come up with a distribution plan for sharing the code. This could include displaying it on social media, in print ads, on clothing, or in physical locations where people will pick up there phones to scan it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Along with sharing the code, you might also want to include text instructions in your various promotions that show less tech-savvy people how to scan it. This way there's no friction if people want to scan the code but don't know how to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Scroll down for more tips on &lt;a href="#DisplayYourQRCode"&gt;properly displaying a QR code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Step 8: Track and analyze performance.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Just like any marketing campaign, you should follow up on any collateral or campaigns using QR codes to see whether they're actually working. How much traffic comes from each specific code? Are people scanning your code but not redeeming their offer once they get to the&amp;nbsp;landing page? Or are they not even compelled enough to scan your QR code?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Knowing this will help you troubleshoot and adjust your poorly performing QR codes to more closely mirror those that work well. I recommend you&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht"&gt;include a UTM tracking code on your&amp;nbsp;URL&lt;/a&gt; so you can better measure performance -- this is particularly important if you use &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/analytics"&gt;closed-loop marketing analytics&lt;/a&gt;, and are used to more in-depth reporting on your campaigns.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;How to Use QR Codes (And How Not to)&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that you see how simple the QR code creation process can be, let's talk about some best practices that'll help increase the likelihood your QR code actually gets used.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Display your QR code where it's convenient for people to scan.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Put QR codes in&amp;nbsp;places where scanning is easy, and there's enough time for the consumer to actually scan the code. While you may often see QR codes on billboards and TV commercials, they're not exactly the most user-friendly locations. Think of places and mediums where consumers have the time to scan the code, and, ideally, a Wi-Fi connection as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Optimize the QR's destination page for mobile devices.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Mobile-optimize the page to which you're sending people. Consumers will be on their phone when scanning the QR code, so they should be brought to a page with a positive mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Include a CTA that prompts people to scan your QR code.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Offer a call-to-action (CTA) with the code -- that is to say, tell people what they're supposed to do when they see the code, and what they'll receive if they do it. Not everyone knows exactly what a QR code is, and those that do won't be motivated to scan it unless they're sure there's something worthwhile on the other side.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Don't limit your QR code to one mobile scanner.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't require a special QR code scanner. Your QR code should be app-agnostic so anyone can scan your code with any reader. A lower barrier to entry makes success more likely for you and the user.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Use your QR code to make someone's life easier.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't use&amp;nbsp;a QR code just&amp;nbsp;for the sake of using one. For instance, it's common for marketers to think, "How can I bridge the offline experience with the online experience? Uhhh ... QR code!" That's not wrong ... but it's not always right, either.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have content that makes sense to deliver to a mobile user, and you have an appropriate channel to do it (see use #1 at the beginning of this section), it's more likely your QR code will drive results. For example, in South Korea, grocery store chain Tesco drove tremendous national&amp;nbsp;business growth by using QR codes in subway stations (I guess they have mobile service in their subway stations) to let riders order their groceries while they wait. It's a great example of using QR codes for the right end-goal, at the right place and time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/use-qr-codes-marketing-campaign/103049/"&gt;This article from Search Engine Journal has some more&amp;nbsp;examples of good times to use QR codes, as well&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If after reading this you’re not convinced QR codes are the right move -- or you just want some additional ways&amp;nbsp;you can connect the offline world to the online world -- consider also adding a&amp;nbsp;short, memorable URL people can type in easily on their mobile phones in your creative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The future of QR&amp;nbsp;codes could also mean an evolution -- augmented reality apps certainly stem from the same concept, after all. Consider the &lt;a href="http://snip.ly/XuJv#http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/02/augmented-reality-app-translates-news-into-child-f.html"&gt;AR News App&lt;/a&gt;, which lets readers augment a newspaper story into a child-friendly article by downloading an app and hovering over stories with a special marker (sounds pretty close to a QR scanner, doesn't it?).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/qr-codes-dead"&gt;It may be that QR codes aren't quite dead&lt;/a&gt;, but just the&amp;nbsp;first step in a long evolution.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;a class="close"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;img src="https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F29449%2Fhow-to-create-a-qr-code-in-4-quick-steps.aspx&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" style="min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; "&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Instagram Impressions, Explained in 100 Words or Less</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-impressions</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-impressions" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/instagram-impressions.jpg" alt="instagram-impressions" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;If you're using Instagram as part of your social media strategy, you've definitely come across the concept of &lt;em&gt;impressions&lt;/em&gt;. But what exactly are impressions? How accurately do they indicate success? And how do they differ from &lt;em&gt;reach&lt;/em&gt;, another very similar Instagram metric?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you're using Instagram as part of your social media strategy, you've definitely come across the concept of &lt;em&gt;impressions&lt;/em&gt;. But what exactly are impressions? How accurately do they indicate success? And how do they differ from &lt;em&gt;reach&lt;/em&gt;, another very similar Instagram metric?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;First things first: to understand what Instagram impressions are, you need to know how they relate to Instagram's reach metric.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an easy way to distinguish &lt;em&gt;impressions&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;reach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impressions&lt;/strong&gt; measure the number of times your post or ad appears to users. This metric doesn't take into account unique users -- so, if your post or ad is shown 100 times to the same person, it would technically count as 100 impressions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In contrast,&lt;strong&gt; reach&lt;/strong&gt; measures the number of &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; users who view your post or ad. So, if your post is shown 100 times to the same person, your impressions would be 100, but your reach would be one.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, when should you prioritize impressions as a key performance indicator in your Instagram campaigns?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you want to increase awareness among your target audience.&lt;/strong&gt; Many marketers getting started with Instagram focus on reaching the most people possible -- but in reality, it doesn't matter if you reach 10,000 new people if none of those people are interested in what you're selling. In some cases, it's more valuable to your business to focus on cultivating deeper brand awareness among the audience you already have. Instagram Impressions can be a valuable KPI when you want to focus on increasing awareness among your target audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Consider your own Instagram scrolling habits: if you see an ad or a post just once, it likely isn't going to have a big impact on you. But, if you start to notice more posts or ads from the same company, your familiarity of their brand is bound to increase. Even if you aren't in the market for what they're selling right now, your awareness of the brand might lead you to make a purchase down the line.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since impressions on their own don't take unique users into account, it isn't the best stand-alone metric to use when you run an Instagram campaign focused on &lt;em&gt;reach&lt;/em&gt;ing the most people possible. But, it can be monitored alongside impressions to track how many times users are seeing posts or ads from you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ultimate Guide to Content Distribution</title>

 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-distribution" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/content-distribution.jpg" alt="content-distribution" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year after year, hundreds of marketers report increased efforts and spending on their content marketing — or the intention to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Year after year, hundreds of marketers report increased efforts and spending on their content marketing — or the intention to do so.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;But great content is a waste if your audience doesn’t know it exists.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Content distribution is an integral, if not the most important, part of your content strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there’s been a rapid influx of content … met with dwindling demand. With almost &lt;a href="https://techjury.net/stats-about/blogs-published-per-day/"&gt;4.5 million blog posts published every day&lt;/a&gt;, there’s only so much content we can consume. Marketing influencer &lt;a href="https://businessesgrow.com/2014/01/06/content-shock/"&gt;Mark Schaefer&lt;/a&gt; argues that, because of this “content shock,” content marketing may not be a sustainable strategy for every business.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While I won’t agree or disagree with this theory, I will equip you with the tools you need to distribute the content you create. By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to build a content distribution strategy that gets your content in front of — and consumed by — your audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although the content distribution process happens &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you create your content, it should be step one of your content marketing strategy. You should know where and how you’re going to &lt;a href="/marketing/5-charts-that-summarize-the-state-of-the-publishing-industry"&gt;publish&lt;/a&gt; and promote your content before you put the proverbial pen to paper — otherwise, your time and resources could go to waste.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where should I publish my content&lt;/em&gt;, you ask? Through the various content distribution channels we discuss next.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content Distribution Channels&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Content distribution channels are the channels through which you share and promote the content you create. There are three types of content distribution channels: owned, earned, and paid. The channels you use to distribute your content will vary based on your audience and resources.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Owned Content Distribution&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Owned channels are the content properties your company owns. You can control when and how content is published on your owned channels. These include your website and &lt;a href="/marketing/should-publishers-blog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, your social media profiles, your email newsletter, or a &lt;a href="/marketing/setting-your-publishing-app-up-for-success"&gt;mobile publishing app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Earned Content Distribution&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Earned channels (also known as “shared” channels)are when third parties promote or share your content. These third parties could include customers, journalists, bloggers, and anyone who shares your content for free — hence the name “earned”.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These channels include public relations, social shares and mentions, guest articles and roundups, and product reviews. They also include forums and communities like &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/"&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt; — while posting on these sites is free, the content is owned by these third parties and therefore falls under earned channels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Paid Content Distribution&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Paid channels refer to when your company &lt;a href="/marketing/should-you-pay-content-distribution"&gt;pays to distribute your content&lt;/a&gt; on certain channels. This primarily includes &lt;a href="/marketing/ppc"&gt;pay-per-click (PPC)&lt;/a&gt;, paid social advertisements, and &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers"&gt;paid influencer content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram illustrates how these three content distribution channels overlap and how you can combine them to enhance their impact and reach.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Untitled%20presentation%20(1)-1.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=Untitled%20presentation%20(1)-1.png" alt="content-distribution-channels-hubspot" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/inbound-marketing-statistics-for-2018/"&gt;70% of marketers lack a content strategy&lt;/a&gt;, how many do you think have a content &lt;em&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt; strategy? I’d bet not many.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some marketers recommend that you spend 20% of your allotted content marketing time creating your content — and &lt;a href="https://sujanpatel.com/content-marketing/80-20-rule/"&gt;the other 80% promoting it&lt;/a&gt;. Sound like something you’re doing? If not, this is where a &lt;strong&gt;content distribution strategy&lt;/strong&gt; comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A content distribution strategy is important for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It boosts your content impact past curation and creation.&lt;/strong&gt; As I said above, great content is practically useless if nobody’s reading it. A &lt;a href="/marketing/content-distribution-ideas"&gt;content distribution strategy&lt;/a&gt; gets your gorgeous content in front of the right eyes.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It aligns your team and the teams with which you collaborate to create and share the content&lt;/strong&gt;. Depending on the size of your company, you may have several cooks in the content marketing kitchen. (I know we do at HubSpot.) A content distribution strategy aligns all these different parties and ensures you’re all collaborating efficiently.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It sets goal benchmarks against which you can measure your distribution performance&lt;/strong&gt;. Content distribution can be vague — a simple press of the “Publish” button, and you’re done. A content distribution strategy helps you set benchmarks and hard goals to chase while &lt;a href="/marketing/publishing"&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt; and promoting your work.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to build a content distribution strategy for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Research your target audience.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Content distribution is all about getting your content in front of your audience. You can’t do this properly if you don’t know where they are and what they like to read. Before you build your strategy any further, research your target audience so you know precisely who will be consuming your content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Start by collecting demographic data from your website visitors, email subscribers, social media followers, and customers. Take a look at your audience’s gender, age, income, location, education, and related categories. You can pull this information from &lt;a href="/marketing/google-analytics"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; or your social media analytics tools.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Next, collect feedback directly from your customers, email subscribers, and social media followers. Ask them about their pain points and needs as well as how they feel about your current content and distribution efforts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use these two data points to create your &lt;a href="/marketing/buyer-persona-research"&gt;buyer persona&lt;/a&gt;. Your buyer persona(s) act as models of your ideal customers and content consumers and represent their pain points, information preferences, and motivations as you build out the rest of your content distribution strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Audit your content.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You may already have some published content out there, such as blog posts, videos, social media content, and more. While your new content distribution strategy doesn’t involve removing that content, you should perform an audit to understand if it’s helping or hurting your distribution efforts. Auditing your current content will also remind you of which topics you’ve already written about and which ones you can expand on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A thorough content audit is comprised of three main parts:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging your content&lt;/strong&gt;. Logging your content can be done manually or with a tool. (We recommend the latter, especially if you’ve been publishing content on multiple properties and channels.) Tools like &lt;a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/"&gt;Screaming Frog&lt;/a&gt; can help you crawl and collect your content, listing each URL, title, and description in a spreadsheet. The free version crawls up to 500 URLs. If you opt for a manual content audit, follow the steps in our blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/creating-a-content-inventory"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing your content impact&lt;/strong&gt;. If you &lt;a href="https://www.semrush.com/content-marketing/content-audit/"&gt;crawl your content with SEMRush&lt;/a&gt;, the tool will also list content length, social shares, and backlinks. This information can help you assess the impact of each piece of content, alerting you to anything that needs to be &lt;a href="/marketing/what-to-do-when-your-latest-content-piece-falls-flat"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt;, rewritten, or erased.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying your content gaps&lt;/strong&gt;. You can also identify gaps in your content using the &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/content-gap"&gt;Ahrefs Content Gap tool&lt;/a&gt; or by performing &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht"&gt;keyword research&lt;/a&gt; to discover new keywords or keyword phrases to add to your content, thus helping it rank higher and for more terms.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://dynomapper.com/blog/12-content-audits/283-top-content-audit-tools"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for 30+ more content auditing tools.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Choose your content distribution channels.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="#content-distribution-channels"&gt;content distribution channels&lt;/a&gt; are arguably more important than your content itself, hence why this step comes before content creation and after target audience research. Once you know your target audience, you’ll have a much better idea of how to get your content in front of your followers and customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your analysis, you may post on forums and communities like Reddit or Quora — and pay to promote your content on those sites, too. Alternatively, you may choose to exclusively share content on social media channels, or perhaps you find that traditional PR is your best route.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which content distribution channels you choose, ensure they align with your audience’s preferences and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Also, be sure to optimize your owned distribution channels — your blog, email newsletter, and social media profiles — as these are relatively inexpensive and in your control. Even if research shows that your audience prefers forums to social media or news sites to company blogs, never neglect your owned properties as these reflect on your brand and product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you work through this step, set aside time to optimize your &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/blog-readers"&gt;blog-to-gain readership&lt;/a&gt;, brush up on how to send email newsletters (or &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/email-newsletters-that-dont-suck"&gt;start sending them&lt;/a&gt;), and learn about &lt;a href="/marketing/social-media-marketing"&gt;organic social media marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Decide on your content types.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After you determine your distribution channels, consider what types of content you’d like (and have the resources) to create.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many companies choose to publish all of their content on their blog and then repurpose and re-publish it. Blog posts are universally consumed, easy to repurpose and localize (i.e. translate into other languages), and simple to share — not to mention that almost &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;50% of buyers read a company’s blog while making purchase decisions&lt;/a&gt;. For these reasons, we recommend &lt;a href="/blog/tabid/6307/bid/47/engineering-blog-readership-7-ways-to-drive-prospects-to-your-small-business.aspx"&gt;building a business blog&lt;/a&gt; and then expanding your content types from to share on other channels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Consider these content types — and how you’ll repurpose and distribute them — as you create your blog posts:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;E-books&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Podcasts and interviews&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Videos&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Infographics&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Case studies&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;White papers&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Testimonials&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Webinars&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Checklists and listicles&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Datasheets&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5. Set your content distribution KPIs and goals.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Goals help us recognize where we’re going and what success might look like when we get there. Your content distribution strategy should involve setting goals for your content key performance indicators (KPIs) and their subsequent metrics:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 97.994%; height: 350px;"&gt; 
 &lt;tbody&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="height: 52px;"&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 52px;"&gt;key performance indicators&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 52px;"&gt;related metrics&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="height: 55px;"&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Traffic/reach&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Unique page views by channel and source&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="height: 55px;"&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Engagement&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Bounce rate, average time on page&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="height: 55px;"&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Top content (and falling content)&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Top page views, top exits&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="height: 55px;"&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Impact&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Click-throughs, conversions, backlinks&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr style="height: 55px;"&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Sentiment&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 50%; height: 55px;"&gt;Comments, social shares&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These metrics may vary based on your distribution channel (i.e. you can’t track comments on your email newsletter or top exists on your social media ads), so be sure to choose the metrics that correspond best to each channel. It might take a few months to establish a baseline for each channel, especially if you haven’t used it before.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Set &lt;a href="/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33898/How-to-Set-SMART-Marketing-Goals-for-2013-TEMPLATE.aspx"&gt;SMART goals&lt;/a&gt; for your content using these metrics. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;pecific: I want to increase our blog’s organic traffic by boosting backlinks from other reputable websites and blogs. This will increase our search engine ranking, thus bringing in more organic traffic.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;easurable: I’d like 30 new backlinks to our blog.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ttainable: We’re already generating 10 new backlinks each month &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; an intentional strategy, so I believe 30 new backlinks this month &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; our strategy is feasible.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;elevant: This goal aligns with our broader organic content marketing strategy and could also boost our earned media as we get mentions from press outlets and third-party bloggers.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime-bound: I’d like to receive these backlinks within the next month.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. Build an editorial calendar (and include distribution).&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Content marketing and distribution require lots of planning to be successful. This is where an &lt;a href="/marketing/business-blog-editorial-calendar-templates"&gt;editorial content calendar&lt;/a&gt; can come in handy. You can create one in Excel or Google Sheets, or even &lt;a href="/marketing/create-robust-editorial-calendar-ht"&gt;use Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt;. Tools like &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/coschedule"&gt;CoSchedule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/asana"&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://trello.com/en"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; are helpful, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your editorial calendar, like your content distribution strategy, helps your team stay aligned and work towards common goals. It also gives your writers and editors a roadmap for what they’ll be working on in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what your editorial calendar may look like (using this post as an example):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-07-29%20at%203.24.13%20PM.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-07-29%20at%203.24.13%20PM.png" alt="content-distribution-content-calendar-social-1" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your editorial calendar is the perfect place to include your content distribution plans and goals. Here’s what that may look like on your editorial calendar:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-07-29%20at%203.22.57%20PM.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-07-29%20at%203.22.57%20PM.png" alt="content-distribution-content-calendar-social-2" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See how the right-hand columns now include categories like “Publish Destinations” and “Repurposing Plans”? Your editorial calendar should serve as your hub for all content creation &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; distribution plans.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?hubs_post-cta=pillar_kwphrase"&gt;Manage and plan your social media content with our free Social Media Content Calendar Template.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. Create your content.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After you research your audience, audit your content, decide on your distribution channels and content types, and build your editorial calendar … it’s time to create your content. Content creation will vary based on your resources, team size, industry, and brand, so to get the most pointed, applicable advice, check out our &lt;a href="/marketing/content-creation"&gt;Guide to Content Creation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you work on your new content, check out these tools:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://answerthepublic.com/"&gt;AnswerthePublic&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you flesh out topics and understand what your audience is searching for&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/"&gt;Canva&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you build gorgeous infographics and images&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/vidyard"&gt;Vidyard&lt;/a&gt;, which is a video hosting and publishing platform made for marketers&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://anchor.fm/"&gt;Anchor&lt;/a&gt;, which is a free podcasting tool for beginners&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’ll talk more about &lt;a href="#content-distribution-tools"&gt;content distribution tools&lt;/a&gt; in the next section.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. Distribute and market your content.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You’ve created your content … now it’s time to put it out in the world. Following your editorial calendar and chosen distribution channels, publish and market your new content. As for any marketing channel, be sure you follow rules to optimize your posts on each channel.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="/marketing/reddit-ads-guide"&gt;our team at HubSpot paid for ads on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and found that it was helpful to organically engage with Redditors as well as pay for ad space. Alternatively, if you’re posting on (or paying for) social media, be sure to follow the guidelines for the &lt;a href="/marketing/social-media-post-best-times"&gt;best times to post and share content&lt;/a&gt; — the same goes for &lt;a href="/sales/best-time-send-email-report-2015"&gt;sending emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. Measure and analyze your results.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As always, be sure to keep an eye on your content distribution results. Remember those KPIs, metrics, and SMART goals &lt;a href="#content-distribution-kpis"&gt;you established in step five&lt;/a&gt;? Time to pull those out.;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After you’ve published your content, take a look at Google Analytics, your social media analytics dashboards, and your blog performance — depending on where and how you distributed the content. Make sure you set a routine time to measure and analyze (weekly, monthly, or quarterly) so that you can establish a baseline and know which numbers you can beat the following week or month.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whew! So, that’s what it takes to build a content distribution strategy. Be sure to iterate on this process; these guidelines may change as you expand your content efforts and scale your team. Now, let’s talk about the &lt;a href="/marketing/the-marketing-stack-for-publishers"&gt;tools you need&lt;/a&gt; to get it done.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Content distribution can be an arduous process, but thankfully there are many &lt;a href="/agency/content-distribution-tools"&gt;content distribution tools&lt;/a&gt; out there to help you get your work discovered and consumed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Content Tools&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These tools help you publish your content on additional networks and forums to reach broader audiences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Medium&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; is a content platform that individuals and businesses alike use to publish content. You can use Medium in addition to or in lieu of your traditional blog. (We recommend in addition to your blog as this will give your content the broadest reach.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Medium is where thousands of readers consume content. It’s a one-stop-shop platform for all kinds of content … kind of like Amazon is for products. For that reason, consider publishing to Medium to increase the number of people who see your content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free and paid&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;LinkedIn Pulse&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/"&gt;LinkedIn Pulse&lt;/a&gt; is similar to Medium except it lives on LinkedIn. While there isn’t a homepage that aggregates all the published content, it’s still a helpful tool for getting your written content in front of your followers (for free). You can publish on LinkedIn Pulse through your personal or company LinkedIn pages by simply clicking “Write an article”.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: LinkedIn Pulse is also a &lt;a href="https://mobile.linkedin.com/pulse"&gt;mobile application&lt;/a&gt; that you can download to receive daily headlines and trending news.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Read more about publishing on LinkedIn Pulse &lt;a href="/marketing/linkedin-publishing-beginner-guide"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;PR Tools&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These tools help connect you with journalists and publications to help expand your earned distribution channels and gain backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;

It offers packages for state and local, regional, and national press.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Paid&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;HARO&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/"&gt;HARO&lt;/a&gt; stands for Help a Reporter Out, which is an online platform that connects journalists and sources. In this case, you’d be the source.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you sign up for HARO, you’re sent daily emails with journalist queries. Respond to these queries to be potentially featured in an article. This is a reactive content distribution tool, but it’s helpful for getting press mentions and backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use this tool to link to social networks from partners, customers, brand advocates, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

You can use Mention to monitor any mentions of your brand name, content, or social networks and respond accordingly. This is a great tool for measuring the impact of and engagement around your content and see who is promoting it for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free and paid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sharedcount.com/"&gt;SharedCount&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that helps you measure the engagement of your social media posts. Simply input a URL, and SharedCount will report on its likes, shares, comments, and other engagement measures. While it can’t help you distribute your content, it can alert you to which pieces are performing well and which pieces may need to be updated or scrapped.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free and paid&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Additional Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>8 of the Best A/B Testing Tools for 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-testing-tools</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-testing-tools" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/ab-testing-tools.jpg" alt="ab-testing-tools" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;In the marketing industry, we treat experts like they’re village elders, soaking up every tip and trick they have to offer so we can implement them into our own work, desperately hoping for similar results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the marketing industry, we treat experts like they’re village elders, soaking up every tip and trick they have to offer so we can implement them into our own work, desperately hoping for similar results.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;But, when you really think about it, marketing is always changing and experts often don’t have visibility into your unique context.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This naturally begs the questions -- what should you do when you can’t find a solution to one of your problems on the internet? To find the answers to your unique problem, consider channeling your inner Sherlock Holmes and &lt;a href="http://jayacunzo.com/blog/innovation-requires-seeing-today"&gt;become an investigator&lt;/a&gt;. Investigators forage for information that’ll lead them to the answers of their own specific questions. And, as a marketer, one of the best investigative tools at your disposal is A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Every company has a different set of customers, so there’s no one-size-fits-all formula for designing the most optimal website, crafting the most compelling copy, or building the most effective product. To figure out which website design, line of copy, or product feature will produce the best results for your company, you must discover what your unique set of customers prefer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To help you do this, we’ve curated eight of the best A/B testing tools for 2019 that’ll help you optimize your website design, copy, product, and, most importantly, help you find the answers to your own specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;

But what about writing &lt;em&gt;introductions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ompelling readers to actually read the article is an art form in and of itself -- and if you don't do it well, then you're denying yourself potential promoters, subscribers, leads, and even paying customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html"&gt;the following graph&lt;/a&gt; from Schwartz to see what I mean. It shows where people stopped scrolling in an experiment covering many articles across the web.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Every time someone landed on an article, Chartbeat analyzed that visitor's behavior on a second-by-second basis, including which portion of the page the person was currently viewing. E&lt;span&gt;ach bar represents the share of readers who got to a particular depth in the article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/percent-of-article-content-viewed.jpg?width=568&amp;amp;name=percent-of-article-content-viewed.jpg" alt="percent-of-article-content-viewed.jpg" title="percent-of-article-content-viewed.jpg" width="568"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;Image Credit: &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Of everyone who landed on an article, 10% never scroll down.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So how do you get more people to scroll? One way is by writing a powerful, compelling introduction.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s see about making it better now, shall we? In this post, I'll share with you how to write powerful introductions that turn casual browsers into readers. &lt;span&gt;Article introductions matter, and here’s how to make them count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Keep your first sentence short.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of short sentences. I love them because people can understand them easily. There's an insane amount of value in short sentences that are readable, digestible, and punchy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But often, writers get so caught up in the stress of their introduction that they come out with long, garbled sentences. The problem with long, garbled sentences is that it makes readers work hard. Readers don't &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to work hard to understand your article -- especially at the beginning. Lead off your introduction with a bite-sized sentence or two.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Say something unusual.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard advice like "create a hook" and "grab the reader's attention." But what kind of stuff actually grabs someone's attention? I can think of a lot of things, actually, but they probably wouldn’t be appropriate for an introduction.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What these oft-repeated phrases boil down to is this: say something unusual. Something unexpected, even. If your very first sentence is odd enough to make people want to read the next one, then you've done a good job. If you start off with something boring or expected, you might lose potential readers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Don’t repeat the title.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Assume that the reader already read the title. You don’t need to write it over again. Instead, take advantage of your chance to reinforce that title and to set the stage for the remainder of the article.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Keep the introduction brief.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is no definitive answer for how long an introduction should be. But, like the &lt;em&gt;Slate &lt;/em&gt;study told us, readers have short attention spans. They're impatient to get to the meat of the article. Your readers are looking for information, so don't bury it deep in your article. Cut to the chase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. Use the word “you” at least once.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The word “you” is a powerful word. It tells the reader that you, the author, are writing the article with &lt;em&gt;them &lt;/em&gt;in mind. You empathize with them, you care about them, and you want your piece to resonate with them. It's a simple trick that establishes a crucial connection with your reader.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/content-ideas-research-tools"&gt;a great example&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;span&gt;CloudPeeps'&lt;/span&gt; Shannon Byrne:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/shannon-byrne-intro.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=shannon-byrne-intro.png" alt="shannon-byrne-intro.png" title="shannon-byrne-intro.png" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. Dedicate 1-2 sentences to articulating what the article covers.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your English teacher would call this the "thesis." This is where you tell the reader what the article is about. What will you be discussing, in order? What will the reader learn? Lay it out to help set the reader's expectations and help her decide whether she wants to read the article in full, scroll to different parts, or not read it at all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid of writing, literally, "This article is about &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;" or "In this article, I'll talk about &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;." Here are some variations on this theme to get you started:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;“You’re about to find out why sea turtles always lay their eggs on the beach.”&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;“And, if you’ve ever wondered why sea turtles lay their eggs on the beach, here's everything you need to know.”&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;“This article explains the 17 reasons why these amazing creatures lay their eggs on beaches.”&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;“Fascinating, funny, and shocking, these are the reasons why sea creatures lay their eggs on the beach.”&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. Dedicate 1-2 sentences to explaining why the article is important.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It may be obvious to &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;why the content of your article is important to your readers, but it may not be obvious to them. Let them know loud and clear why it's important for them to know the information you cover in your article. You might compel readers who would otherwise have bounced to keep on reading.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the introduction to this particular article, you'll recall the following sentence:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;f you don't [write introductions] well, then you're denying yourself potential promoters, subscribers, leads, and even paying customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My goal here was to connect the topic of blog post introductions to the broader issues of readers, customers, and revenue.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. Refer to a concern or problem your readers might have.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you can pull a pain point into the introduction, even better. Everyone in every field has their set of problems. You should have some listed already from when you &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-template"&gt;created your buyer personas&lt;/a&gt;. Communicate your awareness of those problems in your introduction and you're more likely to gain a sympathetic reader.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/power-of-story"&gt;a great example&lt;/a&gt; from Buffer's Alex Turnbull, whose intro here is a story format with a problem twist:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/alex-tumbull-intro.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=alex-tumbull-intro.png" alt="alex-tumbull-introduction.png" title="alex-tumbull-intro.png" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;People want to solve their problems, and articles that explain how to do this will help you earn readership.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. But ... be careful telling stories.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people will tell you that you need to write a story in the introduction. &lt;a href="http://neilpatel.com/2015/04/21/how-to-leverage-storytelling-to-increase-your-conversions/"&gt;Stories can work&lt;/a&gt;, as in the example above, but there are good and bad ways to tell stories in your intro.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do use storytelling to spark the reader's curiosity and empathize with her. But don't get carried away and write a long-winded story that loses readers along the way. Remember the tip about keeping introductions short? That still applies when you're telling a story.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2015/04/10/moving-on-from-kissmetrics/"&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt; from one of my own QuickSprout blog posts:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/neil-patel-intro.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=neil-patel-intro.png" alt="neil-patel-introduction.png" title="neil-patel-intro.png" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="normal"&gt;Notice that I highlighted the "empathy" section -- the first sentence. Here, I helped form a connection with my readers. Then, I told a short story about my own experience. After that, I finished the introduction with "what's next."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="normal" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you do begin your article with a story, here's a tip: Don't reveal the conclusion until the reader is deeper into the article, or even until the very end.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 class="normal" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. Use a stat or a fact to convey importance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p class="normal" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When journalists begin a news story, they often give readers an eye catching stat or fact about what's going on. As a blogger or any other type of writer, a really interesting stat or fact will draw your reader in and show them why your topic is really important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="normal" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, say you're a plumber writing a blog post on pipe replacement. You might pull in more readers if you start a post by explaining how frequently old pipes burst in the winter. If readers see that this is a common annoyance that others face, they might keep reading to learn how they can avoid it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The next time you write an article introduction, think about what kind of introduction would make &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;want to read the article.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Would a long, wordy first sentence make you want to read more? No. You might find yourself thinking, &lt;em&gt;Yikes, is this what the rest of the article's going to be like?&lt;/em&gt; and bounce from the page. What about a story or question that doesn't really apply to you? No, probably not.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To compel &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;to read past the introduction of an article, you want to read something unique, fresh, and engaging. You want to hear about &lt;em&gt;yourself &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;problems. You want to be put in a position where the remainder of the article is a must-read experience that will help you solve those problems and change your life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Introductions are hard, and writing effective ones take time and practice. Sometimes, you might find yourself having to re-write them several times before you're satisfied. Remember, it's all worth it if it means keeping the attention of a few more of your readers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the transition from academia to professional life is a milestone that our four-year undergraduate degrees often don't prepare us for!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Making the transition from academia to professional life is a milestone that our four-year undergraduate degrees often don't prepare us for! If you're getting ready to make the jump from backpack to briefcase, here is a week-by-week plan to help prepare you for your &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/guide/guide-to-getting-your-first-job/"&gt;first month of job searching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 1: Self-Reflection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into your job search and applications, it’s time to start reflecting about what you want your first career move to be. Until this point, it’s likely that your choices and variability have been limited, as academic curriculums can be restricted to your core courses and electives. This is a unique time to explore your life, network, and take the time to learn about yourself and your interests.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To do this, ask yourself the following questions:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the last few years, what courses, projects, internships, or part-time jobs have “sparked joy”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the last few years, which of those same elements have I strongly disliked?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If time, money, and resources were not a barrier, what would I want to pursue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What professionals, professors, or classmates inspire me? If I could emulate anything about them, what would it be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you have those elements figured out, you can research which jobs exist that would create alignment between your work and your areas of interest. Start by listing out 10 jobs that might include key ingredients that excite you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Building your career roadmap and vision early on will provide a guiding light as you transition from school to work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 2: Informational Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve started exploring and have that list of 10 jobs, seeking out &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/guide/guide-to-getting-your-first-job/"&gt;informational interviews&lt;/a&gt; will help you develop a better picture of what your desired profession could look like in real time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to reach beyond your network of professors, friends, family and classmates for informational interviews (which you should!), head to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-your-online-offline-professional-network-linkedin-pollack/"&gt;LinkedIn and get networking&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/mentor-meeting-ideas/"&gt;Speaking to people about their careers&lt;/a&gt;, and learning about how they got from A to Z will help you build your own roadmap, and expand your professional network. It will also give you a realistic idea of how to emulate certain careers or accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself getting excited about someone’s job or achievement, it might be because their values and interests align with those of your own. Listen to that inner voice when it’s excited as you start searching for your first job.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While going through this process, you should keep track of all the conversations you have. Mark down who you’ve spoken to, what the interaction was, and what the outcome was. This helps build meaningful relationships early on, fine tune your messaging, and serves as a &amp;nbsp;journal for self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You might find that many people are too busy to take your calls. This is to be expected, so challenge yourself to reach out to at least two to three new people a day, and make sure to follow up. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 3: Look Towards Your Own Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve explored yourself, spoken to some professionals, and have some guidance about where you want to go, start going through your internal network.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Open up a new spreadsheet and build out a company list of 20 places you would want to work. Once you have that list, start talking to your friends, families, colleagues, alumni, professors, and anyone you’ve spoken to in step one and two, to see if you know anyone working in any of those organizations. See if any of your contacts, or any of your contact’s contacts know anyone that can put you in touch with the right people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Get your name out there and tell your network you’re looking for a job! If people don’t know you’re looking, and don’t know what you’re looking for, they won’t know to refer you. Everyone has been where you’re starting out, and most people will be willing to help you land that first gig.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 4: Head to the Job Boards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve moved through your network, it’s time to hit the &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/"&gt;Glassdoor’s job search.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rather than sitting home hitting refresh on the job boards every five minutes, give yourself a schedule, and a routine that will help you build good habits and avoid any toxic behaviors. For example, you can say, “After 2:00 pm, I’m not applying for jobs anymore and instead I am going to spend the afternoon improving my French speaking skills”. Also, you should set up a &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/mlp/create-job-alert.htm?source=PR"&gt;Job Alert&lt;/a&gt; for the term or terms that may be contained in your ideal job. For example, if you’re on the hunt for a writing job, &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/mlp/create-job-alert.htm?source=PR"&gt;set up job alerts&lt;/a&gt; for the words “writer,” “editor,” “content,” “content creator.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At this stage of your career, the focus should be to find a job that will give you &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/must-have-entry-level-worker-skills/"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;, and experience to help you build your foundations. While you shouldn’t be too picky early on (ex: rejecting a good job because it’s not your dream job), you should try and only apply for jobs that you feel will help move you in the right direction professionally.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Give yourself benchmarks, and reward yourself along the way. For example, you might say, “if I get 5 really good applications done in the next 2 days, I’ll take myself for a pedicure”. Celebrate yourself!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While academia provides a linear framework for you to work within, you’ll have to get used to the ambiguity and uncertainty that exists when job searching and building your career. Finding the right job will not happen overnight, so keep calm, and remember your career will be a journey, and not a final destination!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;An order review page is almost always the final place a customer goes before they make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An order review page is almost always the final place a customer goes before they make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;At this point, they've probably &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage"&gt;done their research&lt;/a&gt;, considered competitor products, know the price and details related to your product, and are ready to buy. If the page is easy to understand and causes no confusion, odds are that your customer will press the "Make Purchase" button with no hesitation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But, if the page feels vague, unprofessional, and doesn't give full product details, the customer might pause and worry that they're purchasing the wrong product or giving their money to a less-trustworthy company.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, if the page includes advertisements, excess images, a complex navigation bar, and other unnecessary elements, the customer might get distracted, click away from the order page, and take longer to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design-ecommerce-conversions"&gt;design your ecommerce site&lt;/a&gt;, you might wonder, "What do I need on this page to seal the deal?"&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, you just need to keep it simple. Think of order reviews &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-best-practices"&gt;like landing pages&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of using the page to convert a customer to a lead, you just want them to click the purchase button.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get them to click quickly, allow the customer to review their exact product selection, a photo of the product(s), delivery information, and accurate costs associated with the order. When this page focuses on the product information that's important to the customer, they'll trust that they're purchasing the correct item and won't get deterred from pressing the purchase button.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you create a review page, make sure it includes these helpful elements:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A headline, banner, or progress bar saying "Order Review," "Review Order," or something similar.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The customer's name, contact information, and shipping address.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;An image and basic product description for each product.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A list of any extra specifications or customizations that the customer has designated.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Accurate pricing information showing each product's cost, a sub-total, total, tax, and delivery fee.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Payment information or a payment form.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A brightly colored button with a "Place Order" call to action.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To help you build an efficient order review page, here are nine examples of review pages from real companies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Order Review Page Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neimanmarcus.com/?ecid=NMPT__XX&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn5OL9vzN4wIVx5yzCh2lFAI0EAAYASAAEgLg8_D_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"&gt;Neiman Marcus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Neiman Marcus' order review page allows the customer to make last-minute selections and changes to their shipping information. Then, they can use it to add payment details before making the purchase. On the right of the page, they show transparent pricing information, any gift wrapping designations made by the customer and product information.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j8clYWWgvLzkukXZc3Vj9Z65bepQjunAuE4ulysFUYeXQY4ten4AZilPC_mr5ZqW4LOcaTr-Hk9GIv-d-s44-0MHH8ToYPzuneF81m-xhh1KJuSKpeT9knpxWal0hDc7HU5XGlXX" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the "Item Summary" area, a clear image of the product is shown alongside text that describes color, size, and quantity designations made by the customer. After reviewing this information, the customer will know they're ordering the correct product and will be confident that the right information is on file when they click "Pay Now.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Neiman Marcus is also using a smart strategy of hiding the navigation bar. When you log into Neiman's homepage, the bar is much more detailed and highlights different categories of products. On this page, the element is replaced by a progress bar that shows the customer where they are in the checkout process.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Without a navigation bar, there's less risk that the customer could click off of this page to look at other products. It also focuses the customer on making the purchase at hand. Although Neiman wants customers to look at their products, they've removed the bar on this specific page because it could cause customers to get distracted, abandon their cart, or make slower purchases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/"&gt;Nordstrom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like Neiman Marcus' page, this design is simple and shows off images and details related to each product so the customer trusts that they're making the right purchase. On the top of the page, you see basic shipping information. Then, the bottom of the page goes into detailed specifics. There's a bright blue "Place Order" button on both the top and bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This page's organization allows shoppers with limited time to do a quick review and purchase. At the same time, the details and button at the bottom also cater to customers who want to review the more intricate details.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dgA8F-cjvnGyWnax5q1xL9SH1ndXEARXbPW8Lqhol6crJn8fQxSrCuan7zh5AF23u5sQhT9DMwwN5PTLr3C8cTT806_LPE5j_bp_zzZOiWojcnff2mYfnMnJFwtrLZvTq23eVmhO" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Jh4Jo2uPSqoKOOhxQH0UrEAXh5CzvRTBxnpb3tb4eRoB3ob9oKmra8RPAxoHMtWQrFieSqJnsXCG6PfSEUaHxN_uyZFB_QrKic8x4TJw-meCPM0iEdY5evmX4jhNd6FUdRaMwOiC" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like Neiman, this page also eliminates a navigation bar to ensure that customers are focused on making the purchase as quickly and smoothly as possible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doordash.com/?utm_source=google-sem-brand&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Search_Brand_National_Exact&amp;amp;utm_term=doordash&amp;amp;utm_content=67789639595&amp;amp;kclickid=_k_EAIaIQobChMIjbixn_3N4wIVxYCfCh0q_wB3EAAYASAAEgJ1fvD_BwE_k_&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjbixn_3N4wIVxYCfCh0q_wB3EAAYASAAEgJ1fvD_BwE"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;DoorDash, a HubSpot customer, uses its order review area to give consumers one last chance to edit to their meal delivery. It clearly designates the restaurant they're ordering from as well as specific meal details.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It also shows the customer's delivery instructions and allows them to make slight tweaks, such as adding delivery notes. Although there is a DoorDash logo and a "Back to Menu" button on the top of the page, the design also limits distraction that could lead to an abandoned order.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FXD1FtgORliiqUbvnX5rWmuzVqXEE94dZ3Rj9SOz_1ZymevmAKub9Dtwo2aw_weGV-IfjXLXwt15eE8-uXGigO557Qmk_DPS2UYLt38Sj6WneJqWDZltCmgMeoVfv72m9g9JfQ7r" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ikea.com/"&gt;IKEA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;IKEA's review page takes an extremely simple, but efficient approach. While the other pages on this list have a more branded design, this page looks more like a receipt. It displays a small photo of the product and a small IKEA logo. Then it includes very specific shipping, product, and pricing details in a basic font. Although some might call it bland, this makes the page incredibly understandable and straightforward.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to Nordstrom, IKEA also replaces its usual navigation bar with an order progress bar so the user can focus purely on the order.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H09Elfpwi5eCOrYZtjQkZRWptHf519LS6pm7fsDnYINPnkNg5JNn3m_7IwKLc8qOv_oJvSG4mnBloLxZPwboFnPYJicdKERGCM7Sx06Z5mc_nQP_NNGqpu5D0OXMr-NTH_Serw0B" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://purple.com/"&gt;Purple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Purple, another HubSpot customer, similarly eliminates navigation and includes a progress bar on their order review page. With a sleek, clean design, a customer can easily see a photo of their product, item specifications, and shipping details. Like other pages on this list, there is also a box where you can enter your billing information before making the final purchase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WFRmw2fE-dHdQNTEWn1CcAtGSzQluZVda1-gReheAGjl6vvwDgWcvMo4dG5J2BN3OiLcxJzi4t-NDYg1PCwqirgBg-dA_9V0ALgRK62RTpZ2gUYVHqUydHnv66dvDwK-M-3BMZSx" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chanel.com/en_GB/"&gt;Chanel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Chanel Review page is simple and straightforward. While they do still include the navigation bar, the pictures of the products and text about complimentary items might keep the customer focused on finishing the purchase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This page allows customers to review delivery and product information while also filling out their billing information. It includes a "Complete the Purchase" button that allows them to pay directly after filling out the billing information.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WfFsAFLrVkkFpCNIUdFO-WL8YF9gJSBbneaEMYhs-qclS3e9ufKh713YIL2vB7ZrljhCiECu7OoM7Yf117myGcpL1zfNbHvsBBie7GWwXP7wuifBIdt0KvGfioPyi1gmnJU3aq3O" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sockclub.com/"&gt;Sock Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sock Club, which sells customs socks and offers "Sock of the Month" promotions, has a simple and easy-to-understand layout, despite the fact that they include custom sock details and specifications. The product information is on the right and includes an image of the basic sock and bulleted text that lists all customizations -- such as size and sock design -- made by the customer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BPW0_VNKkVub2hwdOgIjJP9BYxdml29CHISa9reCzJ60-kxFaRk-qk209T3GCAkIDzcHFEA3V8x45ueru7na8yXLJ5onjXdFzbecAr03u0hWDHQYIG1AocClJo0_Nu7oVDu5JjkU" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to the other examples, the page is a different design than its actual website as it removes navigation and replaces it with a progress bar.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/"&gt;Etsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Etsy uses a more playful and colorful order review design. The page includes a fun headline that says "Double check your order details" to emphasize that this page is for a purchase review.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The page also encourages customers to place their order with a simple, but eye-catching tan box that says, "Almost done! Please click 'Place your order' to complete your purchase." The place your order button is black which contrasts well with Etsy's white design.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MbyAUqb4fRxwQYTsk9ixZv5wy_GBUJ5ADsDhVib_sMwqRaIWrdIkSrG27Q-lnYBFOqn_MHK03XmIEcYpVn4A0h16AHhKfcdt0HKJYMLP04bTsz2lCQ7RRfd4MGDdoP1lrqP8Oh1r" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Customers can see detailed product information, a photo, seller information, and a transparent price. They can also add a note to the seller.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like the other pages, Etsy ditches navigation and replaces it with a visual progress bar. This bar style might be fun and motivating for a customer who likes to visually see their progress. Each circle fills up when they complete a task within the checkout process, which might be satisfying to some shoppers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Etsy also includes a "Secure Checkout" sign at the top of the page. Because Etsy allows users to buy products from third-party sellers, this might add a sense of trust that a customer's billing and contact information is safe.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com/?logo=1"&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although Airbnb sells vacation rentals and not goods, this "Confirm and Pay" page is pretty similar to the other pages on this list. It similarly includes a box to fill out payment information, no navigation bar, a photo of the vacation home, and text-based details about the reservation so the user is sure about their purchase and all of its related costs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this page, the customer has already clicked through a page that requires them to agree with the house rules and acknowledge that they understand which amenities are and aren't provided. Because they have already seen ample details, the product description is a little light on this page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9A7c_gMZQHBlrAD9qdZveTla2CQGMPqI46Di_yoRMuN_dh8HwlZZHbOR8ARLBoPMMtUh-4B62GZFrscS85By4apZ5SUC7ucMod6A-Wo75_y49OG81n3jAfR_6KHdD2pB_wGnDvIw" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Along with the standard review page elements, there's also a note saying that this vacation spot is a "rare find" because it is regularly booked out. This might give the customer added motivation to fill out their information and pay as quickly as possible incase they're worried another vacationer might take those dates.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Remember. Keep it simple.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your customer already knows they want to buy your product by the time they reach the order review page. So, you don't need to put large amounts of detail and design time into it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To create an efficient page, aim to balance simplicity with need-to-know information so the customer trusts your company and is confident that they're making the right purchase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Putting too much unnecessary information on an order review page can distract or slow the customer from making a final purchase. However, not enough information can have the customer worried that they might be ordering the wrong thing. So, focus on telling the customer exactly what they need to know, then encourage them to click "Purchase."&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ultimate Guide to Platforms and How They Can Benefit Your Business</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/platform</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/platform" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/platform-1.jpg" alt="platform-1" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, the typical business tool belt was sprinkled with digital tools: email marketing software here, website CMS there, and perhaps software for accounting and tracking sales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, the typical business tool belt was sprinkled with digital tools: email marketing software here, website CMS there, and perhaps software for accounting and tracking sales.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade or so, software has become more intelligent, consumers have become more engaged and easier to learn from … and business owners have become &lt;em&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/em&gt;. What was once a manageable tool belt has become an overflowing tool box akin to what you’d find in a construction worker’s pick-up truck.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/tools-data-complexity-marketing-technology"&gt;recent marketing technology study&lt;/a&gt;, the average marketer is using around 12 software tools a day — with some using up to 31. And this doesn’t even consider any sales, support, HR, or finance tools those businesses are using, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As versatile as technology can be, it doesn't necessarily doesn’t solve the challenge of how to manage, connect, and align all of these different tools. With the sheer amount of software and technology on the market today, is it even possible to return to that convenient toolbelt our entrepreneurial forefathers once knew and loved?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Yes — with a &lt;strong&gt;platform&lt;/strong&gt;. Platforms are the key to creating a centralized home base for all of your marketing technology and more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We compiled this guide to teach you all about platforms, their various applications, and why your business should consider adopting one.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The concept of platforms isn’t new. In fact, platforms are practically as old as civilization itself — dating back to the marketplaces and bazaars of Ancient Rome. In more recent years, shopping malls and auction houses have taken over this brick-and-mortar representation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the rapid rise of technology, platforms have become mainly digital. Scott Brinker, HubSpot’s VP of Platform Ecosystem, defines this type of platform as “a hub, with spokes connecting other products to its center. The hub binds those disparate products together and orchestrates them in a common mission.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A platform makes it possible to connect tools, teams, data, and processes under one digital roof — it creates that tool belt we discussed above. It’s the nucleus of all systems and allows you to connect all your favorite tools seamlessly using &lt;a href="/marketing/integrations"&gt;integrations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations"&gt;Take a look at HubSpot’s Integrations and Applications Marketplace to see some of the integrations that work with your HubSpot software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keep reading to learn how platforms work and how they can benefit your business.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How Platforms Work&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Traditional businesses follow a linear model of business, where they manufacture products or services and conduct transactions with other businesses or consumers. These businesses also own their inventory, and consumers access them to purchase their inventory.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-hubspot-3.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-hubspot-3.png" alt="how-platforms-work-traditional-business" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Platform businesses, on the other hand, follow a circular model of business, where they enable and facilitate transactions between two parties without creating, manufacturing, or owning inventory. Consumers use platforms to purchase products or services from other platform users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-hubspot-4.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-hubspot-4.png" alt="how-platforms-work" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Platforms businesses have proven to be highly valuable — to consumers and investors alike. Did you know that six of the &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263264/top-companies-in-the-world-by-market-value/"&gt;top 10 companies by market capitalization&lt;/a&gt; are platforms? That’s right: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Facebook, and Alibaba.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that in today’s economy, &lt;strong&gt;who a company connects with is more important than the product or service they own and sell&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like we said above, platforms enable interactions and transactions between interdependent groups. These direct interactions inherently create supply (from a seller, service provider, or producer) and demand (from a buyer, service seeker, or consumer) — benefiting both parties.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While traditional businesses create value by creating products or services, platforms create value by enabling these transactions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what that &lt;a href="https://www.applicoinc.com/blog/what-is-a-platform-business-model/"&gt;transaction&lt;/a&gt; typically looks like:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-hubspot-1.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-hubspot-1.png" alt="platform-transaction" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A platform’s success is dependent on more than these transactions, though. Platforms must also attract consumers and producers, enable matches between these two groups, and provide the right technology to aid a transaction — all while maintaining rules and standards that protect both parties as well as the platform itself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the cycle of these four functions typically looks like:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-hubspot-2.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-hubspot-2.png" alt="platform-functions" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Platform Benefits&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The platform business model has &lt;em&gt;revolutionized&lt;/em&gt; business and technology as we know it. Here are a few reasons why.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Platform business models grow faster and scale better.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Platforms that follow the platform business model can grow or scale rapidly because they don’t own the resources that create the value, i.e. the applications, content, service providers, or products. Their growth isn’t contingent upon resources or capital.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Platform business models build a reciprocal, self-sufficient community.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Platforms that follow this business model enjoy “two-sided network effects,” meaning that demand is created from the supply of both buyers and sellers, providers and users, or creators and consumers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This equates to fewer advertising dollars (to attract either buyers or sellers) and stronger word-of-mouth marketing. It also creates a “win-win” situation that allows both the platform business &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; service providers or sellers to profit from users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Platforms solve for connection and efficiency issues.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As marketers (or salespeople or support representatives), we tap into dozens of tools each day. In fact, &lt;a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2018/04/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2018/"&gt;there are almost 7,000 marketing technology vendors globally&lt;/a&gt;. Platforms create a centralized location for the tools and applications we use to grow our businesses, reach our customers, and collaborate with our teams.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Time and energy are two things that businesses &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have to spare. Platforms that follow the platform business model become a one-stop-shop for user’s day-to-day processes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’ve defined a platform, and we’ve talked about how platforms have important business ramifications. Next, we’ll cover some real-life platform business model examples, their impact, and how they’ve become successful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Platform Business Model Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How do platforms play out in everyday life? Surprisingly, you’re regularly using more platforms than you realize. Let’s dive into some platform business model examples that will help round out your understanding of the topic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Airbnb&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-airbnb.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-airbnb.png" alt="platform-airbnb" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When planning a vacation and deciding where to stay, the first thing I do is hop on my Airbnb app. I could visit a website like Hotels.com or Google to search for places to stay (which are both platforms, too), but I always choose Airbnb. Why? Not only does it allow me to “live like a local” wherever I’m visiting, but it’s relatively affordable and provides me with a wide variety of lodging.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Airbnb has revolutionized the hospitality and lodging industry. For a company that owns no property, it has beat out some of the most popular hotel chains.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Airbnb has also become successful because of its suppliers — normal people like you and me. Airbnb buyers (guests) attract Airbnb suppliers (property owners), therefore fostering a reciprocal ecosystem that benefits both Airbnb and its users alike.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Uber&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-uber.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-uber.png" alt="platform-uber" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the way Airbnb doesn't own any properties, Uber doesn’t own any cars … yet it’s given the taxi industry a run for its money. Sure, it’s almost always cheaper, but it also provides a much more modern and arguably safer experience. Riders can pay digitally, split the fare with other riders, and track their ride all the way to the destination.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Uber drivers also receive perks. They control their driving schedule, have access to frequent bonuses, and can find passengers wherever they are — without having to wait at a taxi stand or long queue.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Uber platform supports both parties. By managing payment, ratings, and all dispute resolutions, Uber makes it easy to be both a driver and rider — and only takes a small percentage of earnings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-facebook.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-facebook.png" alt="platform-facebook" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Chances are, you didn’t realize Facebook is a platform. Think about it: Facebook produces no original content and owns no media … yet, it collects data and brings in tons of advertising revenue. Talk about brilliant. In fact, you can consider almost every other social network to be the same.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By creating a fun, interactive place for people to connect and share content, Facebook has built one of today’s most influential platforms. Content created by Facebook users attracts other Facebook users who create more content … so on, and so forth. Facebook is a great example of a platform's reciprocal network effects that create monetization opportunities for the platform itself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Amazon&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-amazon.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-amazon.png" alt="platform-amazon" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Amazon currently sells &lt;a href="https://www.nchannel.com/blog/amazon-statistics/"&gt;over 12 million products&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.nchannel.com/blog/amazon-statistics/"&gt;over 310 million active users&lt;/a&gt; worldwide — and that product count doesn’t include books, wine, media, and services.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What’s even more fascinating? Amazon doesn’t own the vast majority of the products they sell. Sure, it owns warehouse space, advertising space, a handful of product lines, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/amazon-will-compete-with-fedex-and-ups-to-become-logistics-company.html"&gt;now transportation fleets&lt;/a&gt; … but it primarily sells other companies’ inventory. It enables (easy, quick, and cheap) transactions between sellers and buyers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Amazon brings in &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; from advertising, seller fees, and Prime membership subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Medium&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-medium.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-medium.png" alt="platform-medium" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Medium rocked the online publishing world when it was released in 2012. Bloggers, writers, and journalists could publish content online (without cost) without having to worry about hosting a website or getting their work approved by editors. In fact, large news sources and companies — including &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt; and the White House — started publishing content on Medium, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It became a content free-for-all, and readers benefited all the same. Readers could visit Medium and access a variety of fresh content from thousands of writers. As a platform, Medium manages its website … and that’s about it. The corporation doesn’t publish any content of its own, nor does it employ any writers. It simply connects readers and writers to produce and consume great content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;HubSpot&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/platform-hubspot.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=platform-hubspot.png" alt="platform-hubspot" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Last year, HubSpot announced that it’s transitioning from an “all-in-one suite vs. &lt;a href="/marketing/hubspot-integrations-ecosystem-2018"&gt;all-on-one platform&lt;/a&gt;”. This means that it’s expanding to adopt hundreds of more integrations to benefit customers and help them easily expand their tool belt — instead of requiring them to add and master even more disparate systems.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In short, more disconnected software means more friction (and frustration) for customers. Folks are used to either using too many tools that don’t connect or using archaic platforms that don’t solve for today’s buyer (a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; customers). HubSpot plans to fix that.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The HubSpot platform will allow you to seamlessly connect your tools, teams, data, and processes so you can power frictionless experiences for your customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Grow Better With Platforms&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Platforms business have revolutionized the economy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how other companies conduct business. Not only do they bring together consumers and producers and create a valuable network, but they also solve countless connection and efficiency issues.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’re juggling dozens of marketing tools, consider working with a platform to help streamline your tools, teams, data, and processes. In the meantime, keep an eye out for the platform businesses around you — you might be surprised by how many you already use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Get Better at Delegating [Infographic]</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-get-better-at-delegating</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-get-better-at-delegating" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/delegating-tasks.jpg" alt="delegating-tasks" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Being a good delegator often doesn't come naturally. In fact, I'm guilty of being a pretty terrible delegator myself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Being a good delegator often doesn't come naturally. In fact, I'm guilty of being a pretty terrible delegator myself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, the risk seems to outweigh the reward -- for instance, I might have a project I need finished immediately, and the risk of miscommunication that might occur as I offhand tasks to someone else seems too high for me to bother.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But delegating is a critical skill for any manager to learn, and can increase productivity and revenue for your company's bottom line -- in fact, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182414/delegating-huge-management-challenge-entrepreneurs.aspx"&gt;CEOs who delegate generate 33% greater revenue&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, delegating is often critical for achieving the highest-quality work. Why &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;delegate if you have someone on your team with talents and skills better suited for a certain task?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, delegating is critical for your team's success, and your own sanity. But it's easier said than done. Fortunately, the folks at &lt;a href="https://www.headwaycapital.com/blog/get-better-delegating/"&gt;Headway Capital&lt;/a&gt; put together the following infographic, full of tips and tricks to enable you to get better at delegating. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>14 PowerPoint Presentation Tips to Make More Creative Slideshows [+ Templates]</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/easy-powerpoint-design-tricks-ht</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/easy-powerpoint-design-tricks-ht" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/powerpoint-presentation-tips-templates-1.jpg" alt="powerpoint-presentation-tips-templates-1" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;I like to think of Microsoft PowerPoint as a test of basic marketing skills. To create a passing presentation, I need to demonstrate design skills, technical literacy, and a sense of personal style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I like to think of Microsoft PowerPoint as a test of basic marketing skills. To create a passing presentation, I need to demonstrate design skills, technical literacy, and a sense of personal style.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If the presentation has a problem (like an unintended font, a broken link, or unreadable text), then I’ve probably failed the test.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even if my spoken presentation is well rehearsed, a bad visual experience can ruin it for the audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Expertise means nothing without a good presentation to back it up. For starters, grab your collection of &lt;strong&gt;free PowerPoint templates&lt;/strong&gt; below, and use the tips that follow to perfect your next presentation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;No matter your topic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/templates-create-beautiful-powerpoints" style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;successful PowerPoints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt; depend on three main factors: your command of PowerPoint's design tools, your attention to presentation processes, and your devotion to consistent style. Here are some simple tips to help you start mastering each of those factors, and don't forget to check out the additional resources at the bottom of this post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;PowerPoint Presentation Tips&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Don't let PowerPoint decide how you use PowerPoint.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Create custom slide sizes.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Edit your slide template design.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Write text with your audience in mind.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all of your objects are properly aligned.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Use "Format Menus" to better control your objects' designs.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Take advantage of PowerPoint's shapes.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Create custom shapes.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Crop images into custom shapes.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Present websites within PowerPoint.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Try Using GIFs.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Keep it simple.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Embed your font files.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Save your slides as JPEGs.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Embed multimedia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Bring your own hardware.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Use "Presenter View."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;PowerPoint Style&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. Don’t let PowerPoint decide how you use PowerPoint.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft wanted to provide PowerPoint users with a lot of tools. But this does not mean you should use them all. Here are some key things to look out for:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Make sure that preset PPT themes complement your needs before you adopt them.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Try to get away from using Microsoft Office’s default fonts, Calibri and Cambria. Using these two typefaces can make the presentation seem underwhelming.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Professionals should never use PPT’s action sounds. (Please consider your audience above personal preference).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;PowerPoint makes bulleting automatic, but ask yourself: Are bullets actually appropriate for what you need to do? Sometimes they are, but not always.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Recent PPT defaults include a small shadow on all shapes. Remove this shadow if it's not actually needed. Also, don’t leave shapes in their default blue.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. Create custom slide sizes.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you usually can get away with the default slide size for most presentations, you may need to adjust it for larger presentations on weirdly sized displays. If you need to do that, here's how.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;In the top-left corner, choose "File."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select "Page Setup."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Type the height and width of the background you'd like, and click "OK."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A dialogue box will appear. Click "OK" again.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Your background is resized!&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Resize your slides before you add any objects to them or the dimensions of your objects will become skewed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-310975138-gif/Blog-Related_Images/Change-Size-of-Background-PPT-2.gif?width=667&amp;amp;height=394&amp;amp;name=Change-Size-of-Background-PPT-2.gif" alt="Change-Size-of-Background-PPT-2" width="667" height="394"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. Edit your slide template design.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Often, it's much easier to edit your PowerPoint template before you start -- this way, you don't have design each slide by hand. Here's how you do that.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select "Themes" in the top navigation.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;In the far right, click "Edit Master," then "Slide Master."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Make any changes you like, then click "Close Master." All current and future slides in that presentation will use that template.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-312971807-gif/Blog-Related_Images/Change-Slide-Master-1.gif?width=667&amp;amp;height=386&amp;amp;name=Change-Slide-Master-1.gif" alt="Change-Slide-Master-1" width="667" height="386"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;4. Write text with your audience in mind.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A significant part of a powerpoint's content is text. Great copy can make or break your presentation, so evaluating your written work from a few different angles could make you seem more persuasive. Thinking about how your text is received differentiates good presenters from the best.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typography:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many people underestimate the influence of typeface, but choosing the right font is important -- the perception of your font type could influence your audience's impression of you. The right font is an opportunity to convey consistent brand personality and professionalism.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some fonts are seen as clean and professional, but this doesn't mean they're boring. A common mistake is thinking your font isn't "exciting" enough, which could lead you to choose a font that distracts from your overall message.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Powerpoint-creative-tips-font.png?width=247&amp;amp;name=Powerpoint-creative-tips-font.png" alt="Powerpoint-creative-tips-font" width="247" style="width: 247px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.workfront.com/blog/10-tips-for-designing-presentations-that-dont-suck-part-1"&gt;Workfront&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That said, you can still use fun and eccentric fonts -- in moderation. Offsetting a fun font or large letters with something more professional can create an engaging presentation. Above all, be sure you're consistent so your presentation looks the same throughout each slide, so your audience doesn't become distracted by too many disparate fonts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Powerpoint-creative-tips-example.png?width=400&amp;amp;name=Powerpoint-creative-tips-example.png" alt="Powerpoint-creative-tips-example" width="400" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://designshack.net/articles/typography/best-font-for-powerpoint/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design Shack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;5. Make sure all of your objects are properly aligned.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Having properly aligned objects on your slide is the key to making it look polished and professional. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; manually try to line up your images ... but we all know how that typically works out. You're trying to make sure all of your objects hang out in the middle of your slide, but when you drag them there, it still doesn't look quite right. Get rid of your guessing game and let PowerPoint work its magic with this trick.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;How to align multiple objects:&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select all objects by holding down "Shift" and clicking on all of them.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select "Arrange" in the top options bar, then choose "Align or Distribute."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Choose the type of alignment you'd like.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-312283316-gif/Blog-Related_Images/Align-to-Object.gif?width=667&amp;amp;height=386&amp;amp;name=Align-to-Object.gif" alt="Align-to-Object" width="667" height="386"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;How to align objects to the slide:&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select all objects by holding down "Shift" and clicking on all of them.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select "Arrange" in the top options bar, then choose "Align or Distribute."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select "Align to Slide."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Select "Arrange" in the top options bar again, then choose "Align or Distribute."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Choose the type of alignment you'd like.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-311233443-gif/Blog-Related_Images/Align-to-Slide.gif?width=667&amp;amp;height=385&amp;amp;name=Align-to-Slide.gif" alt="Align-to-Slide" width="667" height="385"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;PowerPoint Design&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;6. Use "Format Menus" to better control your objects' designs.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Format menus allow you to do fine adjustments that otherwise seem impossible. To do this, right click on an object and select the "Format" option. Here, you can fine-tune shadows, adjust shape measurements, create reflections, and much more. The menu that will pop up looks like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2412769509-png/powerpoint_format_menus.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=powerpoint_format_menus.png" alt="powerpoint_format_menus" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although the main options can be found on PowerPoint’s format toolbars, look for complete control in the format window menu. Other examples of options available include:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Adjusting text inside a shape.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Creating a natural perspective shadow behind an object.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Recoloring photos manually and with automatic options.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;7. Take advantage of PowerPoint's shapes.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many users don’t realize how flexible PowerPoint’s shape tools have become. In combination with the expanded format options released by Microsoft in 2010, the potential for good design with shapes is readily available. PowerPoint provides the user with a bunch of great shape options beyond the traditional rectangle, oval, and rounded rectangle patterns, unlike even professional design programs like Adobe Creative Suite or Quark.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Today’s shapes include a highly functional Smart Shapes function, which enables you to create diagrams and flow charts in no time. These tools are especially valuable when you consider that PowerPoint is a visual medium. Paragraphing and bullet lists are boring -- you can use shapes to help express your message more clearly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;8. Create custom shapes.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you create a shape, right click and press "Edit Points." By editing points, you can create custom shapes that fit your specific need. For instance, you can reshape arrows to fit the dimensions you like.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2411891015-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/edit_points.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=edit_points.png" alt="edit_points" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to combine two shapes together. When selecting two shapes, right-click and go to the "Grouping" sub-menu to see a variety of options.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine &lt;/strong&gt;creates a custom shape that has overlapping portions of the two previous shapes cut out.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Union&lt;/strong&gt; makes one completely merged shape.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intersect &lt;/strong&gt;builds a shape of only the overlapping sections of the two previous shapes.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtract &lt;/strong&gt;cuts out the overlapping portion of one shape from the other.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; By using these tools rather than trying to edit points precisely, you can create accurately measured custom shapes.
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;9. Crop images into custom shapes.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Besides creating custom shapes in your presentation, you can also use PowerPoint to crop existing images into new shapes. Here's how you do that:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Click on the image and select "Format" in the options bar.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Choose "Crop," then "Mask to Shape," and then choose your desired shape. Ta-da! Custom-shaped photos.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-311233448-gif/Blog-Related_Images/Crop-to-Shape.gif?width=667&amp;amp;height=392&amp;amp;name=Crop-to-Shape.gif" alt="Crop-to-Shape" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" width="667" height="392"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;10. Present websites within PowerPoint.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tradition says that if you want to show a website in a PowerPoint, you should just create link to the page and prompt a browser to open. For PC users, there’s a better option.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Third party software that integrates fully into PowerPoint’s developer tab can be used to embed a website directly into your PowerPoint using a normal HTML iframe. One of the best tools is LiveWeb, a third-party software developed independently.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By using LiveWeb, you don’t have to interrupt your PowerPoint, and your presentation will remain fluid and natural. Whether you embed a whole webpage or just a YouTube video, this can be a high-quality third party improvement.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Mac users don’t have a similar option. Agood second choice is to take screen shots of the website, link in through a browser, or embed media (such as a YouTube video) by downloading it directly to your computer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;11. Try Using GIFs.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;GIFs are looped animated images used to communicate a mood, idea, information, and much more. Users &lt;a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an-animated-gif-to-a-slide-3a04f755-25a9-42c4-8cc1-1da4148aef01"&gt;add GIFs to Powerpoints&lt;/a&gt; to be funny or quickly demo a process. It's easy to add GIFs to your slides. To do so, simply follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Download and save the GIF you want.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Go to the slide you want the GIF on.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Go to the "Home" tab, and click either "Insert" or "Picture".&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;From the "Picture" drop-down menu, choose "Picture from File".&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Navigate to where you saved your GIF and select it. Then, choose "Insert".&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;To play the animated GIF, click the "Slide Show" tab and then "Play from Current Slide".&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;PowerPoint Process&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;12. Keep it simple.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PowerPoint is an excellent tool to support your presentation with visual information, graphics, and supplemental points. This means&amp;nbsp; that your powerpoint should not be your entire presentation. Your slides -- no matter how creative and beautiful -- shouldn't be the star of the show. Keep your text and images clear and concise, using them only to supplement your message and authority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your slides have dense and cluttered information, it will both distract your audience and make it much more likely that you will lose their attention. Nothing in your slides should be superfluous! Keep your presentation persuasive by keeping it clean.&amp;nbsp;There are a few ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Limit bullet points and text.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Avoid paragraphs and long quotes.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Maintain "white space" or "negative space".&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Keep percentages, graphs, and data super basic.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;13. Embed your font files.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One constant problem presenters have with PowerPoint is that fonts seem to change when presenters move from one computer to another. In reality, the fonts are not changing -- the presentation computer just doesn’t have the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-install-custom-fonts-on-your-computer-quick-tip"&gt;same font files installed&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re using a PC and presenting on a PC, then there is a smooth work around for this issue. (When you involve Mac systems, the solution is a bit rougher. See Tip #11.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s the trick: When you save your PowerPoint file (only on a PC), you should click Save Options in the "Save As …" dialog window. Then, select the "Embed TrueType fonts" check box and press "OK." Now, your presentation will keep the font file and your fonts will not change when you move computers (unless you give your presentation on a Mac).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;14. Save your slides as JPEGs.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In PowerPoint for Mac 2011, there is no option to embed fonts within the presentation. So unless you use ubiquitous typefaces like Arial or Tahoma, your PPT is likely going to encounter font changeson different computers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The most certain way of avoiding this is by saving your final presentation as JPEGs, and then inserting these JPEGs onto your slides. On a Mac, users can easily drag and drop the JPEGs into PPT with fast load time. If you do not use actions in your presentation, then this option works especially well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want your presentation to appear "animated," you'll need to do a little tinkering. All you need to do is save JPEGs of each "frame" of the animation. Then, in your final presentation, you'll just display those JPEGs in the order you'd like the animation to appear. While you'll technically have several new slides in place of one original one, your audience won't know the difference.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An important consideration: If your PPT includes a lot of JPEGs, then the file size will increase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;15. Embed multimedia.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PowerPoint allows you to either link to video/audio files externally or to embed the media directly in your presentation. You should embed these files if you can, but if you use a Mac, you cannot actually embed the video (see note below). For PCs, two great reasons for embedding are:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Embedding allows you to play media directly in your presentation. It will look much more professional than switching between windows.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Embedding also means that the file stays within the PowerPoint presentation, so it should play normally without extra work (except on a Mac).&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Mac OS users of PowerPoint should be extra careful about using multimedia files.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you use PowerPoint for Mac, then you will always need to bring the video and/or audio file with you in the same folder as the PowerPoint presentation. It’s best to only insert video or audio files once the presentation and the containing folder have been saved on a portable drive in their permanent folder. Also, if the presentation will be played on a Windows computer, then Mac users need to make sure their multimedia files are in WMV format. This tip gets a bit complicated, so if you want to use PowerPoint effectively, consider using the same operating system for designing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;presenting, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;16. Bring your own hardware.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Between operating systems, PowerPoint is still a bit jumpy. Even between differing PPT versions, things can change. One way to fix these problems is to make sure that you have the right hardware -- so just bring along your own laptop when you're presenting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;17. Use "Presenter View."&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In most presentation situations, there will be both a presenter’s screen and the main projected display for your presentation. PowerPoint has a great tool called Presenter View, which can be found in the "Slide Show" tab of PowerPoint 2010 (or 2011 for Mac). Included in the Presenter View is an area for notes, a timer/clock, and a presentation display.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-405263686-png/Screen_Shot_2013-12-05_at_2.07.31_PM.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=Screen_Shot_2013-12-05_at_2.07.31_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2013-12-05_at_2.07.31_PM" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For many presenters, this tool can help unify their spoken presentation and their visual aid. You never want to make the PowerPoint seem like a stack of notes that you use a crutch. Use the Presenter View option to help create a more natural presentation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: At the start of the presentation, you should also hit CTRL + H to make the cursor disappear. Hitting the "A" key will bring it back if you need it!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With style, design, and presentation processes under your belt, you can do a lot more with PowerPoint than just presentations for your clients. PowerPoint and similar slide applications are flexible tools that should not be forgotten.&lt;span style="font-size: 1em;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/public-relations-examples" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/10%20of%20the%20Best%20Public%20Relations%20Examples%20to%20Inspire%20Your%20Next%20Campaign-1.png" alt="14 of the Best Public Relations Examples to Inspire Your Next Campaign" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a press release about your company’s new product launch, significant hire, or acquisition fails to pick up the coverage you were expecting. Journalists crave juicy stories and viral marketing campaigns, but standing out in a sea of conventional pitches is one of the biggest challenges for any public relations professional.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a press release about your company’s new product launch, significant hire, or acquisition fails to pick up the coverage you were expecting. Journalists crave juicy stories and viral marketing campaigns, but standing out in a sea of conventional pitches is one of the biggest challenges for any public relations professional.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you need a dose of inspiration, blogs like &lt;a href="https://www.prexamples.com/"&gt;PR Examples&lt;/a&gt; are a great place to find the most compelling PR plays. To save you some time, we curated a list of the absolute best of the best to get the creativity flowing for your next campaign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Read on to get inspired by some of the best minds in public relations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Strange Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Industry Relations&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4 class="video-container-responsive"&gt;&lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vycaHQgYOs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/361000-people-binge-watched-all-of-stranger-things-2-the-first-day-according-to-nielsen-2017-11"&gt;With over 360,000 people who binge watched Stranger Things 2 within a day of its release&lt;/a&gt;, it’s clear the show created unprecedented amounts of hype leading up to its premiere date. One of the stunts that built up this hype was Lyft and Netflix’s Strange Mode prank. By immersing Lyft customers in an environment that was as terrifyingly strange and eerily similar to Hawkins, Indiana, they made Stomranger Things fans feel like they were actually in the Upside Down.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/"&gt;HostelWorld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Even Divas are Believers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Customer Relations&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nsYIDBbtE_A" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Traveling the world can give you some of the best experiences of your life, but it can also thrust you into situations that you’ll want to scrub from your memory, like staying the night in a hostel. There are countless hostel horror stories online and hundreds of videos that mock their hospitality scattered throughout social media -- so needless to say, they don’t have the best reputation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But HostelWorld, a hostel booking website, decided to team up with Mariah Carey to freshen up their image and showcase the pleasant reality of staying in a modern day hostel. Together, they blasted through affordable accommodation stereotypes by spotlighting the lesser known luxuries of hostels like having access to the same facilities as more expensive accommodations, but at a cheaper price, and being able to connect with other fellow travelers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HostelWorld’s message is simple: if hostels are nice enough for divas like Mariah Carey, then they’re nice enough for everyone..&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lawyer.com/"&gt;Lawyer.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Choosing Lindsay Lohan to Be their Spokesperson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Customer Relations&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRMKBbPNRjg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Picking Lindsay Lohan to be your company’s official spokesperson could spark a lot of backlash. But when you connect people with lawyers, the move can produce loads of smiles, publicity, and customers. Lawyer.com’s brilliant marketing play resonated with audiences because Lohan’s troubled past and her frequent brushes with the law makes people who might’ve gotten in a little trouble feel like they’re not alone. It also makes them feel better about themselves. If a high-status celebrity needed a lawyer -- multiple times -- then maybe it’s not so bad if you need one too -- right?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stabilo.com/com/products/highlighting/highlighters/stabilo-boss-original-pastel/"&gt;Stabilo Boss&lt;/a&gt;: Highlight the Remarkable&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Corporate and Social Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There have been remarkable women throughout history that might not have been celebrated as they should have been. Stabilo Boss -- the company that sells highlighter pens -- started a &lt;a href="https://www.adsoftheworld.com/media/print/stabilo_boss_highlight_the_remarkable_katherine"&gt;campaign to highlight these women&lt;/a&gt; and their incredible accomplishments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Stabilo took famous black-and-white photos from historical moments and drew a yellow highlight line to showcase the woman in the photo that made it all happen. The Boss PR campaign highlighted women like Katharine Johnson, the NASA mathematician responsible for the calculations that sent Apollo 11 to the moon. Other examples include Nobel Prize winner Lise Meitner ando First Lady Edith Wilson.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The campaign &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/creativity/these-brilliant-german-ads-about-remarkable-women-are-getting-global-praise-in-social-media/"&gt;blew up on social media&lt;/a&gt; and went on to win multiple awards.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/stabilo_boss_katherine_print_thumb.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;name=stabilo_boss_katherine_print_thumb.jpg" alt="stabilo_boss_katherine_print_thumb" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo credit: &lt;a href="https://www.adsoftheworld.com/media/print/stabilo_boss_highlight_the_remarkable_katherine"&gt;Ads of the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us"&gt;Logitech&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;BS Detection Spoof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Industry Relations&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qlS70If_lNo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hours after April Fools Day, almost every marketing publication rounds up the best spoofs, pranks, and stunts that distracted everyone at work that day. One of the funniest spoofs that earned a spot in all &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; major roundups this year was Logitech’s fake Business Speak Detection product video. By giving their product a punny, yet subtly accurate name, the video pokes fun at most businesses’ obsession and overuse of buzzwords. But it also has the feel of a real product overview, which makes it even more hilarious.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://oldspice.com/en"&gt;Old Spice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; Paper Blazer Ad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Marketing Communications&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/10%20of%20the%20Best%20Public%20Relations%20Examples%20to%20Inspire%20Your%20Next%20Campaign-1.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=10%20of%20the%20Best%20Public%20Relations%20Examples%20to%20Inspire%20Your%20Next%20Campaign-1.png" alt="" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.prexamples.com/"&gt;PR Examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When Fragrance brands advertise in magazines, they usually show off their aromas by drenching an ad with their latest cologne or perfume. But Old Spice realized people usually don’t enjoy unexpectedly pungent scents violating their nostrils when they’re flipping through their favorite magazine. So in typical Old Spice fashion, they gently ribbed other fragrance brands by inserting a paper blazer doused in their new cologne, Captain, in their print ad in GQ magazine. Then they wrote about how these paper blazers can help men attract attention not only with trendy style, but also with masculine smell. The only drawback of the blazer is that it'll turn into papier-mâché on you in the rain.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Humor and cleverness is one of the best ways to appeal to your audience and gain earned media attention, and it seems like Old Spice can leverage them both on any marketing channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MarvelStudios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Avengers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Avengers&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InfinityWar?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#InfinityWar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/PnHfaouOlP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PnHfaouOlP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; — Star Wars (@starwars)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; just shattered &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;’ record for the biggest opening weekend ever by grossing over $250 million. LucasFilm, the studio that created and produced Star Wars, wasn’t bitter though. Instead, they were proud of their friends over at Marvel Studios, and sent them a heartwarming congratulatory tweet. By applauding them for their incredible accomplishment, and not sulking about their broken record, Star Wars earned the respect of movie lovers everywhere -- not to mention some media coverage for the gesture.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.johnniewalker.com/en-us/"&gt;Johnnie Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Jane Walker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Corporate and Social Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To promote gender equality and honor the many achievements of women throughout history, Johnnie Walker launched a female version of its whisky on International Women’s Day called &lt;em&gt;Jane Walker&lt;/em&gt;. The limited-edition bottle featured a woman on their iconic logo, instead of a man, which connected the brand to individuals who also support their commitment to social progress.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In March 2018, Johnnie Walker released 250,000 bottles of Jane Walker, and for every bottle sold, they donated $1 to organizations that empower women. This tangible impact helped their campaign gain even more support and publicity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com/night-at/blueplanet"&gt;AirBnB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbcearth.com/blueplanet2/"&gt;BBC &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth: Night at Blue Planet II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Blue Planet II is considered &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/blue-planet-ii-is-the-greatest-nature-series-of-all-time/550583/"&gt;the greatest nature series of all time&lt;/a&gt;, with its first episode attracting over 14 million viewers and earning the title of Britain’s highest rated TV show in 2017. Watching the show can almost place you into the habitat they’re filming, but BBC Earth wanted to take things to the next level for their biggest fans: they offered them a chance to experience what it’s like to be a researcher and filmmaker for Blue Planet II.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To do so, they teamed up with AirBnB to run a contest for their members, and two lucky winners got to spend three days and two nights in the Bahamas on the research and exploration vessel used in the show’s filming. During their expedition, they lived with and discussed work with researchers and dove deep into the Atlantic Ocean in a submarine with filmmakers to observe some of nature’s most unique underwater wildlife. By offering a once in a lifetime opportunity, BBC Earth could get more people to watch their hit show, and AirBnB could build their brand affinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Affairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;View from SpaceX Launch Control. Apparently, there is a car in orbit around Earth. &lt;a href="https://t.co/QljN2VnL1O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QljN2VnL1O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 
 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/960992715579125760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows Elon Musk wants to send humans to Mars. So when SpaceX launched their newest rocket, Falcon Heavy, into space, it made some headlines. But when the Falcon Heavy suddenly shot a cherry-red Tesla Roadster blasting David Bowie’s 1971 hit “Life on Mars?” into orbit, it was being called the greatest automotive PR stunt in history.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The car will now float between Earth and Mars for millions of years, and serve as reminder for current and future generations to always reach for the stars. The success of both launches also improved SpaceX and Falcon Heavy’s reputation. Falcon Heavy is now the most powerful rocket on earth, so it’s realistic to say it can launch heavy satellites and future space stations into orbit, shuttle cargo to Mars, and even transport humans to the moon. And that’s exactly what Elon Musk needs the public to think if he wants to accomplish his ambitious goals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/scotland"&gt;BBC Scotland:&lt;strong&gt; Scotland From the Sky: Glen Coe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Integrated Marketing and Communications&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBBCScotland%2Fvideos%2F2122860094410411%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="280" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Rough Guides, a renowned travel guidebook, named &lt;a href="https://www.roughguides.com/gallery/most-beautiful-country-in-the-world/"&gt;Scotland the most beautiful country in the world&lt;/a&gt;. And a big reason why it’s such a spectacle is because Glen Coe, a Scottish valley that cuts through the ruins of an ancient super-volcano, is one of the most striking landscapes in the world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;BBC Scotland’s immersive, 360 degree video of Glen Coe grips viewers because they’re able able to experience the landscape from an intimate point of view at every possible angle, which makes them feel like they’re actually there. Publicity of this video benefits both Scotland’s tourist industry and BBC Scotland because it compels people to travel to Scotland and consume more of BBC Scotland’s content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. State Street Global Advisors: &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/nyregion/fearless-girl-statue-stock-exchange-.html"&gt;Fearless Girl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Corporate and Social Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of &lt;a href="https://www.internationalwomensday.com/"&gt;International Women's Day&lt;/a&gt;, the world woke up to find a four-foot high statue of a girl across from the &lt;i&gt;Charging Bull&lt;/i&gt; statue on Wall Street in New York. She is standing tall and brave, hands on her hips, in a dress and high top converse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fearless Girl, as she is called, was commissioned by the investment management firm State Street Global Advisors as a part of their campaign to&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/fearless-girl-wall-street/519393/"&gt; pressure companies to add more women&lt;/a&gt; to their boards. By standing up to &lt;i&gt;Charging Bull&lt;/i&gt;, she is standing up for gender diversity on Wall Street.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fearless-girl-PR-campaign-example.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;name=fearless-girl-PR-campaign-example.jpg" alt="fearless-girl-PR-campaign-example" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neloliviawaga/2017/03/07/international-womens-day-2017-wall-street-meets-the-fearless-girl/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Forbes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some argue that the girl's defiance toward the bull -- and male-dominated corporate boardrooms more generally -- is &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-is-what-happened-when-wall-streets-fearless-girl-met-pissing-pug"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;. There has been lots of pushback to the statue, but in general, this PR campaign received widespread support for the women's movement and diversity in the workplace and remains outside the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. &lt;a href="http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html#"&gt;ALS Association&lt;/a&gt;: ALS Ice Bucket Challenge&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Corporate and Social Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, videos of people dumping a bucket of ice water over their heads flooded social media, now known as the &lt;a href="http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html"&gt;Ice Bucket Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The viral sensation of 2.4 million videos was a way to raise awareness of a neurodegenerative disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -- also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. The idea was to raise money for the ALS Association and research on the disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XS6ysDFTbLU" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The viral challenged raised more than $115 million dollars, with almost $80 million going towards research. The campaign was a massive success -- awareness and funding for ALS has skyrocketed, all thanks to millions of people giving themselves brain freeze.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.guinness.com/en-ie/guinness-clear-responsible-drinking/"&gt;Guinness: Guinness Clear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Corporate and Social Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Guinness pushed a series of ads to promote its newest product: &lt;a href="https://adage.com/creativity/work/guinness-clear/970891"&gt;Guinness Clear&lt;/a&gt;. This completely transparent, refreshing beverage "will keep you hydrated and help you stay in control." Their secret recipe? It's just water.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This lighthearted PR campaign is actually trying to address a more serious issue -- binge drinking. The company hopes that consumers will drink more of their "Guinness Clear" to remember their nights and not overdo it while still having fun. Guinness hopes the ads will &lt;a href="https://adage.com/creativity/work/guinness-clear/970891"&gt;drive conversation and healthier habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jAOlODdyYRQ" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;a class="close"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>17 Ways to Get Free Advertising for Your Business</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-advertising</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-advertising" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/free-advertising-for-your-business.jpg" alt="free-advertising-for-your-business" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;When you work at a small business with a limited budget, it’s not really possible to shell out &lt;a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/business-advice/the-cost-of-advertising-nationally-broken-down-by-medium/"&gt;$340,000&lt;/a&gt; for a 30-second TV commercial, or &lt;a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/business-advice/the-cost-of-advertising-nationally-broken-down-by-medium/"&gt;$10,000 for an email marketing&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you work at a small business with a limited budget, it’s not really possible to shell out &lt;a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/business-advice/the-cost-of-advertising-nationally-broken-down-by-medium/"&gt;$340,000&lt;/a&gt; for a 30-second TV commercial, or &lt;a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/blog/business-advice/the-cost-of-advertising-nationally-broken-down-by-medium/"&gt;$10,000 for an email marketing&lt;/a&gt; campaign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It can be frustrating when your budget dictates how many people your business can reach.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, there are a lot of free ways to supplement your paid advertising efforts. By incorporating free advertising tactics into your strategy, you can remove some nonessential costs and dedicate your budget to deeper, more longterm plays.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we suggest some of these methods regardless of your budget.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To help you spread the word about your business without breaking the bank, we’ve compiled 14 ways to get advertising for free.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Use Google My Business to optimize for local search.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful free ways to advertise your business is through Google My Business, which enables companies to manage their presence on Google Search and Google Maps. The tool can bolster your rankings in local search results.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ranking high in local search shows you’re a legitimate and relevant company: you wouldn’t rank #1 in Google for “pizza places near me” if you’d closed down six months ago. Plus, if you rank high in local search, more consumers will choose your business over a competitor’s. In today’s fast-paced world, convenience is key.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#FreeGoogleAds"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; or scroll to the bottom of this post to learn &lt;a href="#FreeGoogleAds"&gt;how to advertise on Google for free&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and find out more about this process.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.yext.com/"&gt;Yext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The more places your business is listed online, the better your chances of showing up in search results, and the easier it is for potential customers to find you. To ensure great local SEO, the details of your listings on every website and online directory need to match up.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if your website lists your company’s new phone number, but Yelp lists your old one, this inconsistency &lt;a href="https://moz.com/blog/why-listing-accuracy-is-important-whiteboard-friday"&gt;could hurt your SEO&lt;/a&gt;. Yext scans the web to find every place your business is listed, so you can tweak your listings to guarantee accuracy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Write guest posts for other blogs&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a few major advantages to guest posting for a well-established blog. You can benefit from connecting to that blog’s audience, and you can also start establishing yourself as a thought leader in your industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since guest posting on a popular blog allows you access to an established audience and high domain authority, this practice can sometimes be more beneficial than posting to your own blog. Plus, you can link back to your own website from your article, giving you an inbound link that boosts your domain authority and can increase your own website's ranking in search engines.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Answer Quora questions.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Writing content for Quora can expose your business to a large audience: TechCrunch &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/23/quora-launches-blogging-platform-with-mobile-text-editor-to-give-every-author-a-built-in-audience/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that some of Quora’s active contributors receive more than 30,000 monthly views.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Besides the large built-in audience, your business can answer direct questions from prospective customers. This lets you interact with high-quality potential leads and establish yourself as an expert in the subjects that matter most in your industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. Publish content on LinkedIn.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is an platform to connect with professionals, which is why it’s also a great place to share business-related content. LinkedIn’s blogging platform lets you demonstrate your expertise within your industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your connections and other LinkedIn members will engage with your posts and share them, doing the free promotion for you. With almost &lt;a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/linkedin-b2b-marketing/2017/10-surprising-stats-you-didnt-know-about-marketing-on-linkedin"&gt;half of all social media traffic&lt;/a&gt; coming to B2B company sites from LinkedIn, it’s a missed opportunity if you don’t publish and promote content on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. Offer to do interviews on other business’ podcasts.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To figure out which platforms your team should priortize, it’s important to diversify your promotion platforms to discover where your audience is already consuming content. Some of your audience might prefer listening to podcasts over reading articles. To reach those people, contact a few businesses with podcasts and pitch interview ideas.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. Promote your website on your email signature.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With all the emails you send every day, it’s a shame if you aren't taking advantage of the promotional potential of your email signature. Your email signature can also be unexpected property to promote a sale, contest, event, or even a new blog post. Add a link to your business' website on your Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram profiles, as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. Send email newsletters.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An email newsletter can be a useful vehicle to promote content, share business-related news, and build deeper relationships with both potential and existing customers. There are plenty of free tools out there that assist you in designing, sending, and optimizing your newsletter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the right time investment, an email newsletter can be the perfect place to share quality content with leads and potential consumers, establishing your brand as helpful and informative.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. Network at in-person events.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Connecting with fellow professionals at industry networking events is a great opportunity to meet potential consumers in a place where they are eager to discuss your business. The niche topics of networking events ensures you’re meeting high-qualified leads. For example, a “Best Technology Startups of 2018” event will primarily be filled with participants who are interested in technology and startups.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Particularly for small businesses looking to make their first connections, networking is a chance to get your name out there, meet potential partners, and find opportunities for growth. Plus, it’ll keep you up-to-date on trends in your industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. Speak at an event.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Similar to networking, speaking at an event about a topic related to your industry is another way to exhibit your expertise. Giving a thought-provoking and powerful speech will draw attention to you and, by association, your business, which can increase brand awareness and prove your business is qualified to tackle consumer’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To start, brainstorm different topics and volunteer at various upcoming networking events and trade association conventions. If you’re afraid of public speaking (don’t worry, a lot of us are), you could enroll in a local Toastmasters chapter to improve your game.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. Do a free product giveaway or contest&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A product giveaway or contest is an easy way to incentivize new viewers to check out and subscribe to your social media channels or website. Plus, handing out inexpensive branded products like t-shirts or mugs is a good way to spread your brand name. Word of mouth is alive and well -- and a little swag can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. Put up brochures or flyers.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Putting up brochures or flyers in local libraries, coffee shops, and businesses is a unique way to market to offline locations where people spend a good deal of their time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can create free brochures and flyers on PowerPoint. Depending on your industry, it might even help you reach an ideal clientele: if you’re a physical therapist, for example, perhaps you could hand out brochures to local gyms or nearby hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. Create YouTube videos.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;YouTube has more than &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/press/"&gt;a billion active users&lt;/a&gt;, which accounts for almost one-third of everyone on the internet. Plus, &lt;a href="http://www.insivia.com/27-video-stats-2017/"&gt;59% of executives&lt;/a&gt; -- i.e. decision makers -- go to videos before written content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Creating engaging and informative YouTube videos is one of the most efficient ways to sell your brand. If done right, your YouTube videos will entertain viewers enough to seek out your website.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;14. Take advantage of your partnerships.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Partnerships are an opportunity to offer supplementary services that you don't provide. For example, a web design company and a copywriting agency might choose to partner together, so when a client requires written content for her web pages, the web design company can offer copywriting services from their partner.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This increases consumer satisfaction, and it also provides exceptional advertising opportunities. When your partner’s consumers need your services, your partner will point them in your direction.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;15. Post on social media.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, social media is crucial to most marketing strategies. Luckily, most types of social media platforms and posts are free -- even to businesses. While many platforms will let you advertise, you can still post or tweet for no cost if you're on a budget.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pick the platforms that best suit your audience. Then, post links, photos, videos, or text posts about your company, product launches, or any other occurrence that you'd like to promote. Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are a suitable place to start for most businesses. They all offer a way to share video, text, photo, and link-based posts and have large user bases. To learn more about other forms of social media, &lt;a href="/marketing/which-social-networks-should-you-focus-on"&gt;check out this post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;16. Experiment with photo and video platforms.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="/marketing/which-social-networks-should-you-focus-on"&gt;Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; could be great platforms to start on, expanding to platforms like Instagram or Pinterest will give you more opportunities to show product shots or embrace the heavily-visual strategy of influencer marketing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Aside from spreading awareness with free images of your product or service, most social platforms, including Facebook, offer live video and story features which can allow you to create video promotion related to your products. For example, you might use Instagram Stories or Facebook Live as an outlet to publish tutorials of how to use your products.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because these videos and photos are on social, you can also boost their shareability &lt;a href="/marketing/instagram-hashtags"&gt;by hashtagging them&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;a href="/marketing/instagram-captions"&gt;interesting captions&lt;/a&gt;, and encouraging fans to react with actions&lt;a href="/marketing/comments-on-instagram"&gt; like "likes" or comments.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;17. Encourage happy customers to give online reviews.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Word of mouth is still one of the best ways to market your product. Consumers trust the opinions of other consumers, especially when there are many great testimonies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have happy customers, encourage them to write a review about their experience on popular review platforms like &lt;a href="/service/get-customer-reviews"&gt;Google, Facebook, and Yelp&lt;/a&gt;. If you want great reviews on Facebook, be sure to create a Facebook Business page if you don't have one already.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Advertise on Google for Free&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you can create a free page on Google My Business which can help you rank higher or first in search results. Here's how it works.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Create Your Google My Business Account&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First, you'll want to create a GMail account for your business. Then you'll want to register for &lt;a href="http://google.com/business"&gt;Google My Business&lt;/a&gt; with that account.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Google will first ask you to enter the name of your business. Then, you'll be asked to select a "Delivery Area." In this form, note the mileage and area where your target audience lives.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Delivery%20Area.png?width=534&amp;amp;name=Google%20Delivery%20Area.png" alt="Google My Business Delivery Area Form" width="534" style="width: 534px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Optimizing Your Business Page&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After your setup process is complete, you'll be able to fill out your profile. As you do this, you ideally want to fill out all the information Google requests &lt;a href="/marketing/google-my-business"&gt;for the best search optimization&lt;/a&gt;. A few key things you'll want to include will be:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Your address&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A phone number, email address, and other contact information.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Your website&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Hours of operation&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Photos of your business and products&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A detailed description on what your business offers&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Pricing or menu information&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The year your company opened&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Other business attributes such as "free Wi-Fi."&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The above items are things locals might search specifically for. For example, if someone searches for a "cheap Mexican restaurant open after 8 p.m.", Google will examine your business profile's details and prioritize your restaurant if it seems like a great match.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of what it looks like when a Google business fills out all their information:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Cambridgeside%20Galleria%20Google%20My%20Business%20Listing-1.png?width=455&amp;amp;name=Cambridgeside%20Galleria%20Google%20My%20Business%20Listing-1.png" alt="Cambridgeside Galleria Google My Business Listing-1" width="455" style="width: 455px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Verify and Monitor Your Business Page&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you've &lt;a href="/marketing/google-my-business"&gt;created your Google My Business profile&lt;/a&gt;, be sure to verify your listing so Google knows it's a real, legitimate business. There are a few ways to do this including email, postcard, and phone verification.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also download the GMB app to monitor how your business is doing on a smartphone. &lt;a href="/marketing/google-my-business?_ga=2.205430740.557869883.1563811340-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; walks you through the different verification processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Don't Forget About SEO&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Along with Google My Business, taking advantage of &lt;a href="/marketing/seo"&gt;free SEO strategies&lt;/a&gt; can also help your website rise higher in search results. These tactics can be simple and easy to work into &lt;a href="/marketing/blogging-for-seo"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/marketing/designing-for-humans-and-bots-too"&gt;web design&lt;/a&gt;, or other processes. &lt;a href="/marketing/seo-strategy"&gt;Here's a template&lt;/a&gt; that can help you plan your SEO strategy this year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-gifs" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pI2paNxecnUNW/giphy.gif" alt="Your Cheat Sheet for Posting GIFs on Instagram" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;GIFs are fun, digestible, and, most importantly, relatable -- which is why everybody loves them and shares them on social media so much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GIFs are fun, digestible, and, most importantly, relatable -- which is why everybody loves them and shares them on social media so much.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since Instagram is the top social media platform for visual content, your &lt;a href="/marketing/gain-instagram-followers"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; expect your brand to &lt;a href="/marketing/what-to-post-on-instagram"&gt;post more compelling content&lt;/a&gt; than just the photos of your company’s complimentary lunch each week.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Your audience want to feel something when they scroll through Instagram, and GIFs can forge that emotional connection with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Below, we’ll show you how to post a GIF on Instagram -- with a series of GIFs -- and share some of the social network’s best GIF apps.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;How to Post a GIF on Instagram&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Download the free GIPHY app.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Open GIPHY.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Search for a GIF.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Press the "share" button in between the heart and the three dots (it looks like a paper airplane).&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Press the Instagram share button.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Allow GIPHY to access your photos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Allow GIPHY to open your Instagram app.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Choose to post the GIF to your &lt;a href="/marketing/gain-instagram-followers"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/marketing/how-does-the-instagram-algorithm-work"&gt;feed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Add a filter, a caption, and share!&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a series of GIFs that will show you exactly how to post a GIF on Instagram:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;1. Download and open &lt;a href="https://giphy.com/apps"&gt;GIPHY.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;You can find &lt;a href="https://giphy.com/apps"&gt;GIPHY&lt;/a&gt; in the Apple and Google Play app stores.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gifs-step1.gif?width=278&amp;amp;name=instagram-gifs-step1.gif" alt="instagram-gifs-step1" width="278" style="width: 278px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;2. Search for a GIF and tap the one you like.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gif-searching.gif?width=278&amp;amp;name=instagram-gif-searching.gif" alt="instagram-gif-searching" width="278" style="width: 278px; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;3. Press the "share" button in between the heart and the three dots (it looks like a paper airplane).&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;It will drop down to a screen with all the platforms you can share the GIF on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gif-share-1.gif?width=278&amp;amp;name=instagram-gif-share-1.gif" alt="instagram-gif-share-1" width="278" style="width: 278px; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;4. Press the Instagram share button.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This is where GIPHY will give you one or two notifications asking if it can access your photos and open Instagram -- hit "OK" or "Allow".&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gif-step4-1.gif?width=278&amp;amp;name=instagram-gif-step4-1.gif" alt="instagram-gif-step4-1" width="278" style="width: 278px; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;5. Choose to post the GIF to your story or feed.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gif-story-feed-1.gif?width=278&amp;amp;name=instagram-gif-story-feed-1.gif" alt="instagram-gif-story-feed-1" width="278" style="width: 278px; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;6. Add a filter, a caption, and share!&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-gifs-step5.gif?width=222&amp;amp;name=instagram-gifs-step5.gif" alt="instagram-gifs-step5" width="222" style="width: 222px; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The 6 Best Instagram GIF Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free on IOS and Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.7/5.0 Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/-hubspot-becomes-one-of-the-first-marketing-software-companies-to-integrate-with-linkedin-company-pages"&gt;Giphy Cam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On Giphy Cam, you can record your own GIFs and add filters or special FX to them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free on IOS and Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.8/5.0 Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://imgplay.net/index.html"&gt;ImgPlay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; ImgPlay lets you turn your own videos, live photos, photos, and burst photos into GIFs or videos. You can also add captions and filters to your GIF, edit its frame sector and order, and control its frame speed and direction. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free on IOS and Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.7/5.0 Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GIF Maker, you can convert your photos or videos into GIFs, Boomerangs, and memes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free on IOS and Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.6/5.0 Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.momentogifs.com/"&gt;Momento&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Designing for Humans and Bots, Too: How a HubSpot Designer Approaches SEO</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/designing-for-humans-and-bots-too</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/designing-for-humans-and-bots-too" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-hubspot-design-seo.jpg" alt="how-hubspot-design-seo" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the web, design and SEO weren't really friends -- websites with good SEO often had a weak design, while websites with impressive design often weren't great for SEO. During that era, there was some crazy stuff going on involving &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-hat-seo"&gt;stuffing keywords&lt;/a&gt; into content, bad website navigation, and just plain ol' outdated design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the web, design and SEO weren't really friends -- websites with good SEO often had a weak design, while websites with impressive design often weren't great for SEO. During that era, there was some crazy stuff going on involving &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-hat-seo"&gt;stuffing keywords&lt;/a&gt; into content, bad website navigation, and just plain ol' outdated design.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;When I joined HubSpot, I partnered with our SEO team to design online experiences that could grow organic traffic to our website at scale. Knowing the reputation that SEO has amongst designers, I was skeptical about being able to produce engaging designs while delivering the traffic and lead counts for which I was accountable. However, I welcomed the challenge!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I was in for a surprise. Working with our company's SEO team over the past year has led me to realize that the goals of SEO and design don't have to be at odds with each other -- in fact, they're intertwined around anticipating and delivering value to your customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Designing with SEO in mind ultimately creates an excellent customer experience.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, I'm going to explore how you can use SEO-minded design to increase traffic while still maintaining an engaging user experience -- but first, why is it even important?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impact of SEO-Minded Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At its core, our team is looking to deliver traffic to our website, which impacts our ability to acquire leads and product sign-ups.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I see design as an integral part of being able to deliver these KPIs, because we directly influence what visitors -- and search engines -- see on a given page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, designing pages to provide a thoughtful and valuable experience for visitors affects whether our content appears in a SERP (Search Engine Results Page) or not.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if users find our navigation confusing, they might exit our page quickly -- which will indicate to the SERPs that our pages are outdated or don't match the keywords at hand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other design-related factors that could influence SEO -- take a look at our &lt;a href="/marketing/google-ranking-algorithm-infographic"&gt;Ultimate Guide to Google Ranking Factors in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Next, let's explore how your team can practice SEO-minded design.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Practice SEO-Minded Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a few concepts that tie SEO and design together that are helpful in balancing the best practices of both areas, and I want to cover four in particular today. Let's dive in.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Don't neglect the mobile experience.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Google has shifted to &lt;a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html"&gt;mobile-first indexing&lt;/a&gt;, which means that it uses the mobile version of your website for indexing and ranking.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The crazy reality is that Google may never see a desktop version of your website.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This change makes it imperative to ensure content quality isn't compromised when designing for smaller screen sizes. Hiding content on mobile but showing it on desktop is like clipping a bird's wings -- crawlers (the bots that scour the web for new content) won't be able to explore the breadth of your website and gain enough context regarding the value your content provides.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that your site navigation should be fully available to mobile users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you'll want to ensure the link structure on mobile isn't dramatically different from navigation options offered on desktop. Plus, text content and images should remain available to ensure crawlers have enough context to understand what your website is about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I'll be the first to admit that reducing content for mobile is a bad habit I developed earlier in my career, and it's really tough to break.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 To better embrace responsive design, I've shifted my mindset from trying to 
 &lt;em&gt;replicate&lt;/em&gt; the experience across all touchpoints, to delivering the 
 &lt;em&gt;best experience possible&lt;/em&gt; on each platform.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This gives you the freedom to optimize conversion flows on a per-platform basis, leveraging what you know about the needs of your users when they visit your site through different devices.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In support of mobile-first indexing practices, search engines also heavily weigh the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6352293?hl=en"&gt;mobile friendliness&lt;/a&gt; of your website. As a result, you should pay close attention to the following things when designing your site for mobile devices:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size of tappable areas&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure there's enough space for a person to tap on a link with their fingers. Tap targets of at least 48 pixels in size are considered standard by search engines like Google.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using legible font sizes&lt;/strong&gt;: Text sizes should scale to ensure legibility on each device. Using fonts that are too small will result in penalties from search engines.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image asset file sizes&lt;/strong&gt;: When exporting images and other media content, try to optimize the file size for web so it doesn't take forever to load. User attention span is short and if pages take too long to load, potential visitors will abandon your site.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We used this approach when building HubSpot's &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates"&gt;Business Templates directory&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in March 2019. The content we offer is in the form of editable document templates, which users can download and use. Since the templates are offered for Microsoft Word, Excel, and PDF -- typically desktop applications -- we realized users probably wouldn't find much value in downloading the templates to their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On mobile, I decided to prioritize the option to email a link to themselves to download the template later, enabling users to achieve their goals regardless of the platform they were on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zxZN-TmwXTEwW3u1VcrCg2ZnlyoNJd6Ls_xPVn34lHmWnu3g3aZ9FWvW3C9VjOu3ENIrh5VYjDPf348eZYrXrfYKbRdCtd0fuUQtS17npfgZfljcAPg9huYrzaD3vrhyPshjAySa" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slight modifications in the download experience between desktop and mobile create an optimized experience for each platform. These screens show how email to self is the primary option on mobile, while downloading is prioritized on desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I also made a very simple change to my workflow to ensure I'm considering responsive design at every stage of the design process. When I set up a new file in &lt;a href="https://www.sketch.com/"&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; (the main software our team uses for interface design), I always create two "artboards" next to each other -- one for desktop, and one for mobile.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As I'm designing a screen for desktop, I concurrently arrange the same content to the mobile screen size without deleting anything, then make adjustments needed based on the mobile context. It's not quite a mobile-first approach, but it's a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oVVZnlsTA_W-VcTEiqkHNsrO9DsqwkI_u9V5sTjBo0LD8wKI201OPbwZnxh-dXuv6K6Eo3Xc_aam0_M67wmogxjirFhjSPsbJF03WQ7MMg8gsXAPDnd0gzBRK7lPWLZ_oFccw_nF" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a file set up for a responsive design approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Make navigation meaningful.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The better your navigation is at surfacing the way your website is structured, the better crawlers will be able to discover content and understand what your website is about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But clear navigation isn't just for bots -- it also helps visitors navigate your website and find interesting, relevant content. Think about your own experience visiting a website for the first time. Perhaps you've found an article on Google that you enjoyed reading and want to see more articles by that author. A well-organized website makes that content readily available to you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You're probably familiar with several modules that are commonly used to organize content: "Related" feeds, "People also search for", "People also bought …" -- these features are commonly employed on ecommerce and directory websites. Although they might seem gimmicky, they can be valuable to customers for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforces content categorization.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors will learn about how you define categories on your website and the type of content that belongs in each. This empowers them to find specific content without aid.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotes discovery of relevant content.&lt;/strong&gt; This allows websites to deliver value for customers beyond their original query, encouraging customers to perceive us as knowledgeable, helpful sources for information. When they see content from us in the future, they may be more likely to trust us.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helps with decision making&lt;/strong&gt;. These components reduce the cognitive load of having to recognize versus recall data, and customers feel reassured that they are not alone. However, it's important to &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/customer-code"&gt;use this data wisely to be helpful -- and to not abuse it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Other UI components like &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/navigation-breadcrumbs"&gt;breadcrumb navigation&lt;/a&gt; and table of contents may have a bad reputation in the design world, but they're useful for leveraging complex information architectures.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8piHUHzfmskKVS6qhvlSSG9-GxUZVp3Kp99BNm0YXHocOJKGYui3xPwDHWohAOyJWZVdPr4VmkAoy6O_iApEG-mJQqqrkaHQ2LIZfBKK9p9uyVQug9c2prrH0ZddKahMbYXu-4Xs" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These components help manifest how your website is organized -- and let crawlers and visitors more easily find their way around your website.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From a user perspective, clear navigation acts like road signs, telling you more about where you are, where you've been, and where you're going. There's nothing worse than having to resort to the Back button on your browser because you don't know where else to click.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Give people what they want.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you searched Google for answers and clicked on a link that gave you different content than what you were expecting? We can probably agree that getting content that doesn't answer our question is a frustrating experience, and can result in a loss of trust.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Search engines want to serve quality content that answers the queries they receive -- which makes designing pages with relevant content one of the most important parts of enabling strong SEO. After all, when search engines don't deliver quality content, they lose customers and revenue as a result.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what will be valuable to visitors comes from &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/importance-of-user-intent-in-seo"&gt;understanding their &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/importance-of-user-intent-in-seo"&gt;intent &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/importance-of-user-intent-in-seo"&gt;behind a query&lt;/a&gt;. Being familiar with user goals lays the foundation for you to create content that will deliver value.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a few simple ways to learn more about user goals (short of being able to read their minds) that I like to practice on a regular basis:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keyword Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keyword research examines the terms that people are typing into search engines, the number of times it's being searched in a given time period (usually monthly), and a few other metrics that help you determine the value and difficulty of pursuing a search engine ranking for that term.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Examining the full queries people are searching allows you to uncover more about the user's knowledge of the keyword and intent behind their search. Matching the specificity of your content to the user's expectations is critical for ensuring you deliver value.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instance, here's an example to consider:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/laa7bowoMlL6s_lTdJ9jYpGbardTp3KU9zPRMtYfSi8Mn4dkXLMpeejTvS0PQoQdliOBDk1PZ26VXIk6lFRRaQ59cy6B_ZcnbCnmI515YyDfhI7BMBhOeW2eFNkxao07eiFJLuBP" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the first example, someone searching for "business plan proposal template &lt;em&gt;download&lt;/em&gt;" might expect a page that enables them to directly download a business plan template, and connotes a high level of specificity and intent -- this customer is likely in the consideration phase of their search, and probably already knows what a business plan proposal is and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, someone typing a query like "business plan proposal template&lt;em&gt; examples&lt;/em&gt;" might not know what goes into a good business plan, and might be interested in a high-level article that gives them more context, as well as a few different options.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keyword research also serves as a good litmus test for how well your copy resonates with customers. You can use metrics like monthly search volume (MSV) to see which keywords are commonly typed into search engines. This can help you understand how customers are referring to relevant concepts in the real world. You might consider this when weighing the cost and benefits of leveraging a commonly known term versus teaching a new one.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to understand the limitations of using keyword research when incorporating it into your process. Keyword research shows you what users are searching for, but doesn't tell you what they're &lt;em&gt;actually looking for&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;People searching for the same term might be looking for very different things, and that depends greatly on the context that prompted them to enter a query. You can use keyword research to help you form a hypothesis about user intent, but you can't draw any conclusions about causality from it. Using keyword research can be a powerful tool, but only if you take its findings at face value and use it properly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Empathy Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once I've looked at the words people are searching for, I start to analyze the possible intent behind their query. For each page or asset I'm creating, I'll create a brief list of the keywords, goals, and content a visitor might find valuable to accomplish their goals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This simple empathy exercise helps me consider the context in which people are visiting, and map out the modules that would create value to users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's a template to help you get started with your own empathy exercise:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/empathy-exercise.png" alt="empathy-exercise"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For the Business Template directory, I made a list that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/example-empathy-exercise.png" alt="example-empathy-exercise"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The context behind a user's search query can have a huge impact on their expectations for your content -- so while performing the empathy exercise, it's important to know that you might not capture every use case or scenario.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I use this empathy exercise to form a hypothesis about a user's goals, and then determine what content might be most valuable on that page. This sets a benchmark of the content that must be included, which allows me to wireframe modules that will showcase essential content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We can build off this foundation and add content that oru marketing team or stakeholders may require, as long as it doesn't prevent customers from reaping the most value.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. User Research and Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;User testing or research is another helpful tool in evaluating the assumptions you bring into a project. It's incredible how often your assumptions could be off-base from the actual values your customers hold, so it's critical to get their direct insights whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On our team, we've incorporated both moderated and unmoderated user testing into our arsenal using programs like &lt;a href="https://validately.com/"&gt;Validately&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.respondent.io/"&gt;Respondent&lt;/a&gt;, both of which allow you to recruit and screen users to test your designs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When used together, these three methods can give you a stronger understanding of the context behind people's search terms, as well as the goals they might expect your content to help them meet.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Apply accessibility best practices.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Making your content accessible for all visitors is an important but often overlooked step in the design process. There are a lot of common explanations for why accessibility hasn't been prioritized -- unfortunately, some of these might sound familiar:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Accessible design isn't as visually interesting and looks boring."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It takes extra time to make something accessible for all."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It only impacts a small subset of our customers."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that accessibility isn't that hard, and it's unacceptable to make excuses about why we can't do it. Making content accessible impacts SEO because it creates a better user experience and helps search engines understand what your content is about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If it sounds daunting, these are a few simple things you can do to improve the overall customer experience and positively impact your SEO:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Add descriptive alt text.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alt text helps people who have visual impairments understand what non-text content on your website is about. Technology like screen readers are used to help people with visual impairments interact with websites, and these tools read the alt text you provide when it encounters an image, video, or other non-text content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in cases where images aren't able to load (like slow or unstable internet connections), alt text appears in place of the image so users can still understand the content they're unable to see.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;People aren't the only ones who use alt text -- search engines do, too. Crawlers use alt text for two things:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand what an image is about.&lt;/strong&gt; Capturing the topic and purpose of your image in the alt text description helps search engines rank your image in image searches and drive additional traffic to your website.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand what your website is about.&lt;/strong&gt; This helps search engines better understand what your website is about and the value it delivers to users, which impacts what SERPs your page is seen on.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Designers, developers, and marketers can work together to ensure that descriptive alt text is implemented on all content. Collaborating and keeping each other accountable for this practice can drive traffic to your site, and help us create an inclusive experience for all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Create a clear content hierarchy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using headers to establish a consistent visual hierarchy makes content more digestible for both people and crawlers alike. It's difficult for people to read long bodies of text, so headers play an important role in providing users a way to quickly scan and find their way through long pieces of content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Headers should be visually distinguished, clear, and descriptive, and tell readers (and crawlers) exactly what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Write descriptive anchor text.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's relatively common to see buttons and CTAs that say "Read More" or "Learn More". Unfortunately, this isn't very helpful for visitors or bots in understanding what they should expect to see next.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When effectively used, CTAs and hyperlink copy should help set the visitor's expectation about what a linked page is about, allowing them to evaluate whether or not it would be valuable for them to visit the page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Anchor text is also read by screen readers for visitors with visual impairments, and using links that aren't descriptive can be especially confusing for users who don't have the visual context of where your CTA lives.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Designing with SEO in mind will help you create a stronger, better customer experience. Ultimately, the best thing you can do in any situation is &lt;strong&gt;put the customer first. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By using a collaborative, intentional approach to design and SEO, we can drive measurable impact for our businesses -- and create more inclusive experiences for all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/"&gt;91% of web content &lt;/a&gt;gets no traffic from Google? While creative marketing tactics like blogging will boost brand awareness and show that you have expertise on an industry, not writing a post properly for SEO could mean it misses out on all the great SEO traffic it could get.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/"&gt;91% of web content &lt;/a&gt;gets no traffic from Google? While creative marketing tactics like blogging will boost brand awareness and show that you have expertise on an industry, not writing a post properly for SEO could mean it misses out on all the great SEO traffic it could get.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Numbers don’t lie. If you want to climb to the top of search engine results pages (SERPs), well-written, engaging content alone won’t cut it. You also need to focus on writing SEO-driven, keyword-focused content that attracts not only website traffic, but the right kind of traffic. You might be thinking, “That sounds great, Courtney! But, how do I get started?”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’re sharing seven essential tips for creating SEO-friendly blog posts without sacrificing &lt;a href="http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/does-your-website-user-experience-ruin-or-help-your-brand"&gt;user experience&lt;/a&gt; and engagement, tips you can start using today:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Identify highly-effective keywords when looking for post ideas.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Google handles &lt;a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"&gt;over 40,000 search queries&lt;/a&gt; a second. Staggering, right? If you want to cut through search result clutter and outrank your competitors, you need to target the specific keywords and phrases your potential customers are searching. How else will they find your content and website?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To identify those hot keywords, head on over to the social platforms your target audience frequents and see what’s trending. Pay close attention to the exact phrases they use and monitor popular industry terms and topics.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/trends/"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; can also give you a feel for what keywords are popular at any given time. If you see searches are steadily declining over time for a specific keyword, you know that’s probably not the right keyword to target for your marketing and vice versa for increasing trends.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’re ever running low on keyword ideas, get inspiration from your competition. Use tools to see what keywords they’re currently ranking for — if these keywords are relevant to your business, consider using them too! &lt;a href="https://www.semrush.com/"&gt;SEMRush&lt;/a&gt; lets you enter a competitor and see the keywords they’re ranking for, their position in search results, traffic received for that keyword and other key metrics.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the most obvious keywords aren’t always the best keywords. Searchers tend to use very specific “long-tail” keywords, keyword phrases and questions when they’re looking for something.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Long-tail keywords comprise up to &lt;a href="https://www.hittail.com/blog/the-hidden-value-of-long-tail-seo"&gt;70% of all search traffic&lt;/a&gt; and can unlock the door to successful SEO. When &lt;a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/"&gt;WPBeginner&lt;/a&gt;, the largest WordPress resource site for WordPress beginners, adopted a long-tail SEO strategy, they increased their organic search traffic by &lt;a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-we-increased-our-organic-search-traffic-by-using-hittail/"&gt;20% in just two months&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because you face fierce competition for shorter, more general keywords, you often have a better chance of ranking in the top results for long-tail keywords. And, long-tail keywords allow you to zero in on higher quality website traffic that often knows what they’re looking for and may be farther along in the buyer’s journey.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done your research and built a list of what you think are the most valuable, relevant keywords, plug them into a keyword research tool like Google’s &lt;a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner"&gt;Keyword Planner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://moz.com/products/pro/keyword-explorer"&gt;Moz’s Keyword Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://keywordseverywhere.com/ubersuggest.html"&gt;Ubersuggest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://keywordtool.io/"&gt;Keyword Tool&lt;/a&gt; and so on. Many keyword research tools give you the monthly volume for any given keyword. Test out different keyword tools — marketers are drawn to different ones for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your business or industry (or budget or bandwidth for SEO efforts), it may be important to rank for high competition, short tail keywords. Still, try to also optimize for a healthy dose of long-tail keywords that are high in search volume but low in competition. You may find it’s much easier to rank for these words.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Remember that your focus keywords will evolve over time as trends shift, terminology changes or your product/service line changes. Be sure to conduct keyword research periodically to ensure you’re still focusing on the right keywords for your target audience and not missing out on vital ranking opportunities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Naturally integrate those keywords throughout your posts.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve decided on a list of target keywords, it’s time to write a blog post focused on one of these keywords. Brainstorm blog topics with your team and decide on a topic that will entice and engage your target audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keep your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx"&gt;buyer personas&lt;/a&gt;, their motivations, challenges, interests, etc. in mind throughout the brainstorming process. Choose a topic that will &lt;a href="http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/how-to-create-an-emotional-connection-with-prospects-to-turn-them-into-customers"&gt;emotionally resonate&lt;/a&gt; with your potential customers and their needs, desires or pains.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you write your blog, your keyword and natural variations should be regularly interspersed throughout the post. Your primary keyword should appear in these key places:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#BlogPostTitle"&gt;Title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Headings and subheadings&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;URL if possible&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Image alt text (search engines can’t read images)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Meta description&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Throughout the content&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you’re writing for humans, not search engines. Focus on engaging readers with a natural writing style that takes their needs and interests into account.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to avoid overusing any keyword (also known as “keyword stuffing”) at all costs. Keyword stuffing may lead to a website being penalized or banned in search engine results pages either temporarily or permanently. But even more importantly, if your keyword appears too often and feels forced, you sacrifice a reader’s experience, insult their intelligence and compromise the article’s quality. Don’t give readers any reason to hit the back button and turn to a competitor’s blog for answers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Link to influential websites.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you build out your blog post, don’t be afraid to link to other articles or blogs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Linking to applicable and reputable websites not only offers blog readers additional reading material to expand their knowledge, but it also shows Google and other search engines that you’ve done your research. And the blogger or writer may even return the favor and link to your site.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nothing strengthens a blog post like hard-to-argue-with, research-backed statistics from influential websites. Compelling stats help you build a more convincing and concrete argument that will get your readers thinking (especially when they’re from trustworthy sites they know and love).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Aim for scannable, longer posts.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In an age of short attention spans (&lt;a href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/"&gt;average of 8 seconds for humans&lt;/a&gt;), you would think shorter blog posts are the way to go. But search engines actually prefer longer, in-depth blog posts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The longer your blog post, the greater its chance of appearing in the top search engine results. &lt;a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/"&gt;SerpIQ found&lt;/a&gt; that the 10th position pages have 400 fewer words than 1st position pages. Longer posts will rank more easily for your target keyword.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: the more content on the page, the more clues search engines have to figure out what your blog is about. We recommend writing a minimum of &lt;a href="https://yoast.com/blog-post-length/"&gt;300 words per blog post&lt;/a&gt;. This length gives search engines plenty of keywords and text to crawl and helps them understand what your blog is about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The downside to longer blogs is that they may scare off your readers. We live in a world of skimmers and scanners. In a heat map analysis, CoSchedule learned that &lt;a href="http://coschedule.com/blog/read-your-content/"&gt;only 10-20% of their readers&lt;/a&gt; were making it to the bottom of their posts. So, the million dollar question is, how can longer blog posts appeal to today’s online readers?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can write &lt;a href="http://experience.stratusinteractive.com/blog/scannable-content-your-key-to-writing-successful-blogs"&gt;scannable&lt;/a&gt;, readable blog posts that hook online readers by tightening up your sentences and paragraphs. Turn a long-winded sentence into two. Keep your paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Also, take full advantage of bulleted lists and subheadings that grab reader’s attention. By following these tactics, you’ll create blogs that are easier to read (especially on a mobile device!) and less intimidating to the scanner’s eye.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. Internally link words or phrases to other posts on your site.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Linking to other pages or blog posts on your website helps search engines crawl your website and create a more accurate sitemap. It also helps your audience discover more of your content and get to know you as a trustworthy, credible source of information.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Internal links to other valuable content keep users on your site longer, reducing bounce rate and increasing your potential for a conversion (and isn’t that what it’s all about?).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When linking to any pages on your website, or even outside sources, use natural language for your anchor text. Avoid using spammy or generic text such as “top-rated cheap laptops” or “click here.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead, use descriptive keywords that give readers a sense of what they will find when they click on the hyperlink, such as a &lt;a href="http://hubs.ly/H05xGXn0"&gt;search engine optimization guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Never force feed links to your top webpages, featured products or discounted items. These types of links will only turn off readers and could lead to search engines penalizing your website.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A word of caution: don’t overdo your internal linking or any linking. We know it’s tempting to link to all of your blogs and webpages, but only choose the ones that best enhance the point or insight you’re writing about in any particular blog. Always think about whether or not these links naturally tie in with the subject matter and if they will offer significant value to your readers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. Optimize pictures for the fastest possible page speed.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href="/marketing/google-page-speed"&gt;rewards pages with faster page speed &lt;/a&gt;and places those that lag lower on its rankings. So, it's important to make sure your page-load times are as quick as possible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the leading culprits of page lag is &lt;a href="/marketing/google-page-speed"&gt;large photos&lt;/a&gt;. If the photo you uploaded is too big, it will make the page take a longer time to load -- even if the image &lt;a href="/marketing/google-page-speed"&gt;doesn't seem huge on screen&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, you can keep your posts visually interesting without sacrificing crucial speed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you pick a photo, use a free compression software, like Squoosh.app to make it as small as it can go before it loses any quality. Any removal of excess photo data will speed up loading times so readers won't have to wait.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you suspect that your SEO issues are related to low page speeds, Google offers a free tool that can score your page and give you suggestions for speed improvement. Here's &lt;a href="/marketing/google-page-speed"&gt;a guide on how to use it and boost your score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. Preform link building strategies.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Traffic from places other than Google is &lt;a href="/marketing/link-building-software"&gt;crucial to your search rankings&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Think of search results like a competition where the winners get the most votes. Each webpage that links back to you is considered a "vote" for your website, which makes your content more trustworthy in the eyes of Google. In turn, this will make you rise farther up on search results.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, it's good to write posts that other websites or publications will want to hyperlink within their own posts. You can also write posts on other business' websites that link back to your website in some way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To make your website's blogpost more linkable, include valuable assets or information, such as your own data, original thoughts, infographics, definitions, or other facts that people might not find anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of how this mindset could help you. If you write a post titled "How to Make a Video Tutorial," or "13 Stats about Video Tutorials," bigger sites that are writing about something similar might hyperlink words like "video tutorials" or "research from [Your Company Name]" to your post so they can give their reader more context without repeating your work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you've written the post, you might want to start sending it to other publications or websites that might want to discuss it or link it to their other posts. This outreach lets other publications know of the post and might also help you grow link building alliances with them in the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also consider doing promotion, such as interviews or guest posts that link to your website's blog post to further encourage link building.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These strategies can be key to your SEO success, but they can be time consuming. To help you, consider trying out &lt;a href="/marketing/link-building-software?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Daily%20Emails&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;one of these softwares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How to Title Blog Posts for SEO&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even with a great, SEO-friendly post body, a bad title could hurt you in search engines. To title your post with SEO in mind, draft a clear understandable title that both shows the reader what they're about to read and integrates the keywords you identified in the first step. As mentioned above, write something that pleases Google's ranking algorithms, but is also understandable and enticing to humans.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If you're a beauty blogger and you see that people are searching "how to wear matte lipstick," your post could be titled, "How to Wear Matte Lipstick: A 5-Step Guide."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;On the other hand, if your blog covers artificial intelligence and you see that people are searching a new AI app, you could write a blog post called "How to Use [Insert AI App Name]," or "We Tried the New [Insert App Name] App: Here's What Happened"&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If you blog about farming or sustainability and find out that "what to buy at farm stands" is a regular search, you might write a listicle titled "What to Buy at Farm Stands This Summer."&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want your blogs to rank at the top of page one (and why wouldn’t you?), your main focus should be on creating blogs that both users and search engines will love. By optimizing your blogs for both, you can earn higher rankings in SERPs, get more qualified web traffic and increase conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wasn’t that the exact reason you started blogging to begin with?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook Advertising Advice: 10 Tips From Experts at Trello, WeWork &amp; More</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-advertising-tips</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-advertising-tips" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Facebook-Advertising-Tips.jpg" alt="Facebook-Advertising-Tips" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook started as a way for college classmates to communicate, and it’s since evolved into a hub for content creation, sharing, and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Facebook started as a way for college classmates to communicate, and it’s since evolved into a hub for content creation, sharing, and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/"&gt;Over one billion &lt;/a&gt;active users engage on Facebook every day, which represents a tremendous opportunity for advertisers to leverage their content in front of potential customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The variety of targeting options available allow marketers to get the greatest value out of each ad dollar spent on this vast network, making it an ideal place to drive conversions, downloads, and lead generation. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2016/"&gt;Social Media Examiner&lt;/a&gt; found that 55% of social media marketers use Facebook as their primary platform, and &lt;a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Facebook-Gets-Strong-Majority-of-Worlds-Social-Ad-Spending/1014252"&gt;eMarketer&lt;/a&gt; learned that nearly 68% of all social media ad spending is on &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33319/10-examples-of-facebook-ads-that-actually-work-and-why.aspx#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Facebook Ads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We decided to consult with a variety of successful social media marketers to learn more about their strategies for &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;Facebook Ad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;targeting. Whether you’ve been advertising on the platform for years or are just starting out with &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing"&gt;Facebook marketing&lt;/a&gt;, check out these lessons from the pros to maximize your social media &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising-roi-calculator#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;advertising ROI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;1. Keep track of qualitative metrics.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/mattddrchs"&gt;Matt Diederichs&lt;/a&gt;, Social Marketing Lead at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://hootsuite.com"&gt;Hootsuite&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"We focused on two metrics [in our Facebook Ads campaign] -- video views and offer redemptions. These help us to understand whether it's worth our investment to pay for direct customer acquisition."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"Video views are primarily an efficiency spend, looking at the gross number of video views we can get for our investment, at the lowest possible CPV (cost per view). In the offer redemption area, we can go a bit deeper and also calculate our CPA (cost per acquisition) for each person who redeems the offer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Through all of this, we [also] look really hard at &lt;strong&gt;qualitative feedback&lt;/strong&gt;. Facebook's Reactions allow us to see not only how many people 'like' our content, but also when people 'love' or uh ... [don’t] love our content. We also aspire for our content to be shareable, so we look for post shares and for comments on Ads. To us, that's a leading indicator of content resonation.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;2. Take advantage of Facebook's precise Ad targeting.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharimedini"&gt;Shari Medini&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Host of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://pushpullsales.com"&gt;Push Pull Sales &amp;amp; Marketing Podcast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"You can target &lt;i&gt;any audience &lt;/i&gt;[using Facebook Ads]. Almost everyone is on Facebook, and we all share incredible amounts of information about ourselves. Facebook compiles and organizes all of that data for their Ads platform so that marketers can go as broad or as narrow as they’d like."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"You want to target moms of young children in a 15-mile radius from a [children’s] clothing consignment store? Facebook lets you do that. You want to get young men in the sales profession between the ages of 30 and 35 to click through to your site? Facebook lets you do that.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://andyodom.com/"&gt;Andy Odom&lt;/a&gt;, Digital Marketing Director&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://santanderconsumerusa.com"&gt;Santander Consumer USA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;"Use the Audience Insights feature in your Ads Account to research all of Facebook, fans of your Page, or people in any custom audience to gain better insights into who they are and how to target them.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"You can upload [an email list] as a custom audience and serve special ads just to them."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Haidi Zhu, Head of Performance Marketing at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://wework.com/"&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;[With Facebook Ads,] we start by &lt;strong&gt;analyzing the demographics of our current members&lt;/strong&gt; to better understand who they are based on location, interests, industry, and more. We use this data to develop audiences to identify potential members and further segment down to deliver ads that feature the WeWork offerings, locations, and services that we strongly believe will benefit them most.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyodom"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. Test different creative assets for best results.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankemanuele"&gt;Frank Emanuele&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Host of &lt;a href="http://www.marketersnextdoor.com/"&gt;The Marketers Next Door Podcast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://libertymutual.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"Always A/B test your creative [assets]."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"It's easy to think you know what will capture your audience's attention, but you'll be surprised when you actually test it. I always &lt;strong&gt;compare at least two options&lt;/strong&gt; and track their performance carefully. Then I put my spend toward the top performer to get the most bang for my buck. I often find that the creative I liked best actually isn't my top performer."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;4. Pay attention to what visitors do after they click.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliciapalmieri"&gt;Alicia Palmieri&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Social Media &amp;amp; Content Specialist at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://2u.com"&gt;2U&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"2U uses the 'Learn More' call-to-action because it performs well with the type of thought leadership [education] content we share.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Our end goal when advertising on Facebook is to get people to view longform, data-rich content."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;"Since we host most of this on our website, we work with our web analytics team to &lt;strong style="color: inherit;"&gt;track behavior of people coming from our Ads&lt;/strong&gt;. This helps us ensure that we’re targeting the right people and providing engaging content that they will enjoy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2u.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2u.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5. Don’t force new trends into your Ad strategy.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachaelsamuels"&gt;Rachael Samuels&lt;/a&gt;, Social Media Specialist at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://sproutsocial.com"&gt;Sprout Social&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"The social landscape is constantly evolving, and our social team is constantly adapting to meet the needs of our community and stay authentic in our social presence. It's great to be aware of trends, but &lt;strong&gt;you shouldn't force a trend&lt;/strong&gt; or new network if it's not the right fit for your brand."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"You have to determine a trend's genuine value offer before diving in headfirst. If something isn't resonating with your audience, there's no reason to continue chasing the hype just to be seen doing it -- your audience could see that as a major turnoff."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachaelsamuels"&gt;Aaron Moreno&lt;/a&gt;, Digital Advertising Specialist at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://sproutsocial.com"&gt;Sprout Social&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"It's important to have a clear objective for your ads, clear KPIs and a desired cost-per-conversion."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"Identifying these metrics, setting up proper tracking and &lt;strong&gt;keeping a pulse on performance&lt;/strong&gt; is key to determining ROI from social advertising."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chunersen"&gt;Chelsea Hunersen&lt;/a&gt;, Social Media Manager at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"The principles of creating a good post and grabbing attention are the same no matter what the medium."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;providing clear value and connecting about [your audience’s] real needs&lt;/strong&gt; is something I always try to do.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"I'm less concerned about using a new medium like video or canvas just to use it, but I will try it if the technology gives us a better way to reach our audience.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;6. Find inspiration from your competition.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccaleewhite"&gt;Rebecca White&lt;/a&gt;, Community Manager at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://trackmaven.com"&gt;TrackMaven&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Being able to tell &lt;strong&gt;what your competitors are promoting&lt;/strong&gt; on social is invaluable. Comparing our Facebook spend with that of our competitors gives us a level playing field on which to evaluate the impact of our content."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;7. Publish videos that are short and sweet.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericamoss"&gt;Erica Moss&lt;/a&gt;, Community Manager at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://trello.com"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Because [Facebook offers] such a small amount of real estate, it's important to &lt;strong&gt;get to the point quickly&lt;/strong&gt; with one specific call-to-action, whether it's a discount to redeem, an event to attend or a prompt to learn more about your product or service."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"Avoid lofty or flowery language.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;When considering images, faces and bright colors pop more (high-res only), and&lt;strong&gt; video can be super impactful for ads when kept to 30 seconds or less&lt;/strong&gt;. Bonus points if your video has closed captioning so that users don't need audio to consume your message.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;8. Don't fixate on vanity metrics alone.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jndutc"&gt;Jenna Dutcher&lt;/a&gt;, Content Marketing Manager at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.localist.com/"&gt;Localist.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"Facebook Ads can be a valuable tool, but only if you put effort into actually optimizing and measuring them. We’re big fans of A/B testing here at Localist, and always have at least two iterations of an ad running, sometimes 10-20 versions, where we’ll &lt;strong&gt;test things as small as capitalization, imagery, headlines, and CTAs&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"You also need to be mindful of &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; you’re measuring. Success can’t just be based on how many people click or view an ad -- what does 500 clickthroughs to a post mean to you and your company? &amp;nbsp;Be sure to tie &lt;strong&gt;superficial metrics&lt;/strong&gt; like this to an acquisition goal or metric that you actually value, like cost-per-download or cost-per-lead.&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.localist.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9. Focus on the mobile experience.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasontmyers"&gt;Jason Myers&lt;/a&gt;, Social Media Manager at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://contentfac.com"&gt;The Content Factory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Try composing, or at least &lt;strong&gt;previewing, your Ad on a mobile device&lt;/strong&gt;. Most people view Ads on a phone screen which is why those with stark, text-free images and simple messages get more engagement.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://contentfac.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;10. Experiment with video.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benkessler"&gt;Ben Kessler&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Marketing at &lt;a href="https://www.wework.com/"&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;We are always eager to &lt;strong&gt;test new products&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;and the latest betas to innovate with our marketing. This includes 360” video, renderings, and more, all developed by our in-house team."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;"Because WeWork is truly something you need to experience in person, we’ve seen a lot of success with video to convey our brand and message within Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;11. Diversify your ad format.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/author/alex-york/"&gt;Alex York&lt;/a&gt;, Senior SEO Specialist at &lt;a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-ad-sizes/"&gt;Sprout Social:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are so many different ad channels on Facebook, and choosing which ones to invest in can effectively increase your reach and brand awareness.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"Not every type of ad will work for your brand. However, one of the best techniques to follow when creating paid content is to seamlessly blend into feeds, walls and timelines."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;"It’s necessary to learn the various ad formats so you can fit in well with organic content on the network. For example, if you only used text ads, the 'pop' or 'wow factor' would be much less than a video or brightly colored image."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are messenger ads, dynamic ads, video ads, sponsored mentions, slideshow ads, collections, instant experiences, lead ads, and more. Different formats lead to different results, so &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1263626780415224"&gt;Facebook will recommend formats&lt;/a&gt; that are most conducive for your objectives.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;12. Pay attention to load time.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sandra Rand, Director of Marketing at &lt;a href="https://orionckb.com/blog/sites-long-load-time-suffocating-facebook-ad-revenue/"&gt;Tinuiti:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The longer your website takes to load, the more it adversely affects your conversion rate. Even if your CTR from Facebook Ads is pretty high, your advertising efforts and budget will be wasted if your website takes more than 7.5 seconds to load.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"For the retail e-commerce brand, the difference between 7.5 second load times and 11.5 second load times (which, if my math serves me correctly is a whopping FOUR seconds), meant a conversion rate that plummeted 60% and a revenue drop of 62%."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By connecting with your developers and eliminating unnecessary parts of your landing page, you can cut down on load time and boost your ROI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;13. Convert high-performing content into ads.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Dooley Tombras, President at &lt;a href="https://tombras.com/"&gt;Tombras Group:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dooley Tombras claims that we are in the &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/podcasts/the-growth-show?_ga=2.124683466.1506813886.1563817040-527251855.1560789477"&gt;third phase of social media advertising&lt;/a&gt;, where companies need to strike a balance between editorial and real-time content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"Pay to boost above-average performing content, let below average posts die, and when content blows up, put real advertising muscle behind it to drive sales. Only then does the post become accountable for driving sales."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Organic social is a powerful platform of mass reach and content distribution as well as a great space for content experimentation. When something really resonates with your audience, it's a positive sign to put advertising budget behind it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;"&gt;Learn From the Pros&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve learned different strategies for successful Facebook Advertising, apply them to your next campaign. A common thread among the responses we received for this article was the importance of constantly testing and evaluating results.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to change tactics midway through a campaign to drive greater value and conversions from your Ads. If you’re unsure where to begin with launching an Ads campaign, we have a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to start you off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 New Social Media Platforms Marketers Should Watch in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/new-social-media</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/new-social-media" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/new-social-media-platforms.jpg" alt="new-social-media-platforms" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;When you visit the App Store or Google Play and search "social media," there are hundreds of apps to choose from. But, as the pool of social platforms grows, will any of them really change the game for marketers this year?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you visit the App Store or Google Play and search "social media," there are hundreds of apps to choose from. But, as the pool of social platforms grows, will any of them really change the game for marketers this year?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, probably not. In fact, HubSpot's own social media experts say we should be paying attention to how older platforms evolve in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"For 2019, what I’m keeping my eye on is some of the forgotten channels. Those will be the 'new' channels for 2019," says &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/kelly-hendrickson"&gt;Kelly Hendrickson&lt;/a&gt;, HubSpot's Social Media Manager.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;She adds, "We’re seeing &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/snapchat-ads-marketing-content"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; make a play to provide more relevance to new demographics, especially with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/want-to-try-that-gender-face-swap-thing-everyones-doing-heres-how/"&gt;the gender-swap feature's popularity&lt;/a&gt;. And with Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/facebook-privacy-tools-update"&gt;push for privacy&lt;/a&gt; and connections &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/facebooks-news-feed-friends-family"&gt;with friends and family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups?vertical=groups_discover_us&amp;amp;from_ad=true&amp;amp;ref=sem"&gt;Facebook Groups&lt;/a&gt; could be seen as a new channel as the newsfeed becomes more challenging."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Aside from Facebook and Snapchat, we've also been watching platforms like &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/reddit-plans-proactive-marketer-2019/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/pitch-deck-how-pinterest-selling-ads-ahead-of-ipo/"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; aim to improve on advertising and marketing features.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But, if your role specializes in social media, audience growth, or online engagement -- or if your company targets the early-adopters in Gen-Z or millennial age groups -- you'll still want to be on the lookout for platforms that could gain momentum later on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Why? Watching the growth of young, promising social channels will help you determine which are worth joining and which aren't worth your time. And, if you do end up joining a hot new social channel early on, you may have more time to pick up on what promotional really content works there. This will put you ahead of competitors that launch their accounts later and might struggle to come up with creative post ideas.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To help you stay on the cutting edge of social media, we've compiled a list of five young social platforms that you might want to put on your radar this year. These platforms were either launched or completely rebranded in 2016 or later. They've also all gained a large user base, interest from investors, or news buzz in recent months.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For each platform, we'll walk you through how it works, its user base, why it might be promising to marketers later on, and how you should approach it today.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/"&gt;TikTok &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year Launched: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/12/10/18129126/tiktok-app-musically-meme-cringe"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; (Founded in 2016)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Users:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/tiktok-jimmy-fallon-musically-app-downloads-1203032629/"&gt;500 million+ monthly active users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the lip-syncing app, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/musically-shutdown-tiktok-bytedance-1202893205/"&gt;Musical.ly&lt;/a&gt; merged with a similar one-year-old app called TikTok. Since then, TikTok has reportedly passed &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/tiktok-jimmy-fallon-musically-app-downloads-1203032629/"&gt;500 million&lt;/a&gt; active monthly users. With &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/which-social-networks-should-you-focus-on"&gt;more than 800 million global downloads&lt;/a&gt;, TikTok is now more popular in app stores than Facebook, Instagram, and other prominent social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For those who remember Vine or Musical.ly, TikTok is like a mix of the two. The platform allows you to film short videos that play on a repetitive loop just like Vine. But, like Musical.ly or Snapchat, you can add fun effects, AR filters, text, and musical overlays to zest things up. Like similar video platforms, it has been primarily adopted by &lt;a href="https://mediakix.com/blog/top-tik-tok-statistics-demographics/"&gt;users under 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you make a video, the app also allows you to optimize it by adding hashtags that can make it easier to find via search.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One way hashtags have been embraced on TikTok is through its "Challenges" tab. This area of the platform prompts you to propose a challenge with a themed hashtag. When you post a video that responds to a challenge, you can include the corresponding hashtag so those following the challenge can see your videos.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Along with being widely discussed by publications including the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/tiktok-publishers-comedic-clips/"&gt;Digiday&lt;/a&gt;, the app has also gained notoriety from comedians like Jimmy Fallon. Here's a clip from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq7CCoCO6j4"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt; where he talks about the app and tells fans to compete in his #tumbleweed challenge:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lq7CCoCO6j4" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Aside from being fun and entertaining, the app is "leaking into brand territory," according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalwu/"&gt;Krystal Wu&lt;/a&gt;, HubSpot's Social Media Community Manager. She explained that more brands are on the platform, adding that, "The Washington Post is on TikTok and they are pretty popular too."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpost?langCountry=en"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, as she mentioned, has already gained more than 54,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you would expect a newspaper like this to post content with a more serious or investigative tone, the Post shows off a lighter, behind-the-scenes look at its newsroom. In this example, one of its journalists struggles to walk up the stairs to the sounds of MGMT's "Electric Feel":&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6706482036166626565" width="340" height="700" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Brands like &lt;a href="https://shop.guess.com/en/?mrkgcl=1166&amp;amp;mrkgadid=3224459103&amp;amp;rkg_id=0&amp;amp;cmp=knc_Merkle_G_GUESS_US_Brand_Core_Exact&amp;amp;referrer=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Merkle_G_GUESS_US_Brand_Core_Exact&amp;amp;utm_content=g_337725646531_1t1_e&amp;amp;utm_term=guess&amp;amp;adpos=1t1&amp;amp;creative=337725646531&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-JeHm4u64wIVkICfCh3hrgUoEAAYASAAEgISIvD_BwE"&gt;Guess&lt;/a&gt; have also started to experiment with TikTok. To highlight its new line of denim clothing, Guess launched the #inMyDenim challenge encouraging users to publish videos of themselves wearing Guess denim with Bebe Rexha's song, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdH7aFjDzjI"&gt;"I'm a Mess."&lt;/a&gt; playing in the background.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's a video that someone posted in response to the challenge:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6596452228129623302" width="340" height="700" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, fashion, publishing, and entertainment companies are starting to play with TikTok. As the platform grows, we might see it expand to other industries that are able to get creative and visual with their marketing tactics.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you might not want to focus all of your social media resources on TikTok just yet, it's a great time to familiarize yourself with the app and start experimenting with a few fun videos. You could also try to brainstorm a few challenges or video ideas that could align well with your brand and the platform's young audience. If you see any brands that are in a similar space as you, follow them for some added inspiration.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/31/ex-apple-designers-unveil-caffeine-social-broadcasting-platform-for-games/"&gt;2. Caffeine &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year Launched: &lt;/strong&gt;Founded in &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/caffeine#section-overview"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; and unveiled in &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/31/ex-apple-designers-unveil-caffeine-social-broadcasting-platform-for-games/"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Users: &lt;/strong&gt;Unspecified&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Caffeine.tv, a platform built by &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/31/ex-apple-designers-unveil-caffeine-social-broadcasting-platform-for-games/"&gt;ex-Apple designers&lt;/a&gt;, allows you to create live broadcasts for friends and followers. The broadcasts show up in a feed where you can give an emoji reaction or respond with comments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/N-ao4HPb4Kaoh-hXkl1yRkb0b9wYS0Z8VvPHX0O5j1wkMuX1p1EU3GR6nC8Mi0PB9idO4zet9ncmk5yk3ukxBTQNtlM9JEIr_WgD0JP-o78YOQLrdNEbzEvWWDNJ1YeODnuhqbsX" alt="Caffeine.tv's streaming app interface" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 640px;" width="640"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Along with live video broadcasts, you can also stream your computer or TV screens as you play video games. This makes Caffeine a possible competitor to the slightly older game-streaming service, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/"&gt;Twitch.tv&lt;/a&gt;. Like Twitch, which offers you money for high views or subscriptions, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/24/caffeine-social-livestreaming-platform-launches-monetization-for-broadcasters/"&gt;Caffeine has launched a monetization program&lt;/a&gt; that rewards engaging broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The company hasn't specified user numbers yet, but its Crunchbase profile reveals that is has over &lt;a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/caffeine#section-overview"&gt;$140 million in investments so far&lt;/a&gt;. Caffeine's biggest investor to date is 21st Century Fox.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Aside from investor interest, the platform is starting to make waves in the worlds of entertainment and sports. Recently, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/05/social-broadcasting-platform-caffeine-nets-100-million-from-21st-century-fox-as-the-duo-launch-a-joint-venture-for-content/"&gt;Fox launched a broadcasting initiative&lt;/a&gt; with the company. The platform was also used to broadcast the &lt;a href="https://www.sportsvideo.org/2019/01/28/caffeine-powers-social-streaming-at-x-games-aspen/"&gt;2019 X Games in Aspen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Caffeine's success so far demonstrates how live video and video platforms are gaining quick adoption from younger audiences, especially in the Gen-Z age group. If the app continues to gain interest, marketers might consider using it to show off their brand through a variety of strategies, like behind-the-scenes content, Q&amp;amp;As, or other live videos. This platform could also be useful to marketers in a wide variety of industries, including news, entertainment, gaming, and sports.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If live streaming could help your company spread awareness of a product, it might be a good time to familiarize yourself with both Caffeine and Twitch. As you learn more about the platforms, be sure to determine if your audience is actually using either of them and what they're using them for. Similarly to TikTok, you should also check out what similar brands are doing if you find any with active accounts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have an idea for a live stream that seems too out of the ordinary for Facebook or Instagram, Caffeine could be an interesting place to test it. Because the platform is new, there might not be many norms or rules associated with what content works or doesn't work just yet.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18080280/facebook-lasso-tiktok-competitor-app"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;Lasso by Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year Launched: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18080280/facebook-lasso-tiktok-competitor-app"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Downloads: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/27/tiktok-is-staying-way-ahead-of-facebooks-lasso.html"&gt;70,000+ in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lasso, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18080280/facebook-lasso-tiktok-competitor-app"&gt;quietly launched by Facebook in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, competes directly with TikTok as you can use the platform to make short videos with filters and musical overlays. Here's a quick example of a Lasso post with a musical overlay:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flassovideos%2Fvideos%2F645402375961470%2F&amp;amp;show_text=1&amp;amp;width=476" width="476" height="568" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While Lasso is just getting started, it might be a promising platform in the future because it's owned by Facebook. This could mean the app might benefit from Facebook's user base, technological resources, and financing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the user base for Lasso is still small and its demographics aren't yet specified, this might be Facebook's attempt to reach younger audiences similar to those on TikTok. If that's the case, companies targeting Gen-Z or millennials should continue watching and comparing Lasso and TikTok to see what types of content thrives on these platforms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like TikTok, this type of social platform could be of interest to people in visual or creative fields like publishing, entertainment, and fashion.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://digiday.com/uk/brands-guide-houseparty-teen-app-du-jour/"&gt;4. Houseparty &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year Launched: &lt;/strong&gt;2016&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Users: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/houseparty-video-chat-app-friends-sima-sistani-2018-7"&gt;20 million+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Houseparty is a group-video messaging app that allows video chats that can host &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/uk/brands-guide-houseparty-teen-app-du-jour/"&gt;eight users at a time&lt;/a&gt;. To make things more fun for everyone in the chat, you can use video filters, stickers and other fun effects while a live conversation is in session.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the app itself has been around for a few years, it has gone through a few evolutions and recently gained large bumps in interest and usership. The app first started as Meerkat, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/28/13081014/meerkat-houseparty-video-app"&gt;rebranded itself to Houseparty&lt;/a&gt; and revamped its features in 2016. Since then, Houseparty has climbed app store charts and risen from 1 million to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/houseparty-video-chat-app-friends-sima-sistani-2018-7"&gt;20 million users in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274592/houseparty-app-ceo-sima-sistani-ben-rubin-meerkat"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, Houseparty continued to expand by launching an in-chat gaming feature which allows you to play games with your friends. The app company reports that over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274592/houseparty-app-ceo-sima-sistani-ben-rubin-meerkat"&gt;10 million users&lt;/a&gt; have already played the trivia game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18184058/houseparty-heads-up-ellen-degeneres-gaming-revenue"&gt;Heads Up&lt;/a&gt;, on the platform.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although the app does offer ad-space, marketers of the future might use it in other creative ways. For example, a small makeup company might sponsor a "houseparty" where an influencer can answer beauty questions and show attendees how to use one of their new beauty products.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although it might sound promising, still keep in mind that this app has a number of big-name competitors, including Snapchat which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17191910/snapchat-friend-tagging-stories-group-video-chat-features"&gt;rolled out group video chats&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This app might also take added time and creativity. If you don't have time to host a houseparty or can't think of one that would effectively market your product, you might want to prioritize other platforms first..&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://steemit.com/"&gt;Steemit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year Launched:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Users: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://steemit.com/statistics/@arcange/steem-statistics-20190101-en"&gt;Nearly 1.2 million&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This platform is like Reddit with a cryptocurrency twist. While Reddit rewards "upvoted" engaging posts by pushing them to the top of feeds, Steemit also gives you "Steem" coin if your post does well. Like Reddit, you can engage with posts by sharing, commenting on, or upvoting them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's a look at the platform's "life" category feed. The site's design is simple and similar to Reddit's older website designs with a white background and basic feed style.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XclfrORi29wHhhHeAmb8zptICTMJQflce9UowccA8Q-dyvz1_PAAoSWqWZ_Ns-is-1oMkTs1pOSf6f1cPTrhWFXbsZBg9j03Dw6ejXmxFD6EsW1GnrHzcqIs-cbH1dyPB4ph36t-" alt="Steemit's &amp;quot;life&amp;quot; newsfeed" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because users might be aiming to earn, use, or sell Steem coin, the interface also includes a sidebar that shows the cryptocurrency's live value up against other prominent coinage like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6X1X1Z3wczujAldLb_5ZNuGlGOL4hJNX8pDqEuamu8BdwrgGQUsDGIUv8z9Vv9ECOrxWBNwHymC4ByLV-Y8LmP0gBjutz37aVN3p6tz8vVLAU8GmGGiJRvM_VlScwHQINqfvejGZ" alt="Steem coin compared to other coins including Bitcoin" width="238" style="width: 238px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Steemit claims to have over 1 million users and over 50,000 monthly active users. While its user base is still much smaller than other platforms, it has been buzzed about by &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/steamit-reddit-new-boss-rebuild-elizabeth-powell/"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-social-network-doling-out-millions-in-ephemeral-money/"&gt;WIRED&lt;/a&gt;, and other publications. It has also been called &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steemit-continues-lead-blockchain-based-185900763.html"&gt;a leading social platform&lt;/a&gt; in the world of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even though Steemit is still small, we've included it on this list because it's notable in cryptocurrency communities, discussed by tech journalists, and seems to be one of the first platforms of its kind. Even if the platform does not take off, it's a good example of how cryptocurrency and social media could align to create a social platform in the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, we encourage this to stay just on your watchlist for now. Although Steemit seems new and unique, marketers shouldn't heavily invest time or money into it just yet. Its biggest flaw is that it relies on a strong cryptocurrency market to succeed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The platform already took a huge hit during the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/steamit-reddit-new-boss-rebuild-elizabeth-powell/"&gt;"cryptocurrency winter"&lt;/a&gt; of 2018 when most major coinages lost serious value. While Steem began at $7 USD, the coin's value dropped to just over 40 cents. Today, the coin's value is &lt;a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/steem/"&gt;only 25 cents&lt;/a&gt; -- equal to &lt;a href="https://bitsusd.com/"&gt;2.5 Bitcoin Bits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/steamit-reddit-new-boss-rebuild-elizabeth-powell/"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;, this loss led to mass layoffs at the company. Since then. Steemit has begun to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/steamit-reddit-new-boss-rebuild-elizabeth-powell/"&gt;hire more staff and recently named a new chief officer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If this platform, or one like it, were to take off, it could be a great marketing tool for companies that sell products or services in exchange for cryptocurrency. If cryptocurrency gains more adoption and gains a greater sense of understanding from younger, more tech-savvy audiences, this could boost opportunities on other social platforms like this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;How to Navigate This Crowded Landscape&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A marketer who discovers a hot new social channel first can become an expert on posting engaging content before their competitors even sign up. But, while it's important for marketers to keep interesting platforms on their radar, the first priority should still be to focus time, effort, and resources into the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/which-social-networks-should-you-focus-on"&gt;platforms that are already thriving&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To make sure you're balancing your time between new and old channels accordingly, focus on growing and refining strategies on the successful platforms, then timebox an hour or so once a month to look into newer platforms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you find a platform like TIkTok, that's both relatively new and has a fast-growing user base, brainstorm and schedule a few experimental posts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to use experimentation time wisely and on the right platforms. While TikTok is a great place to experiment and doesn't seem like it's going anywhere soon, there's always a chance that an extremely niche platform, like Steemit, could get purchased and absolved -- or that it could shut down quickly if it fails to grow.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you're determining which platforms are worth watching or experimenting on, here are six questions your team should ask themselves:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are its active user numbers? &lt;/strong&gt;Big numbers could mean that the platform is gaining momentum and that you have even more chances to engage with a large pool of users.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are publications or thought leaders talking about it? &lt;/strong&gt;If a platform doesn't specify exact numbers, but a lot of people, prominent figures, or news publications are discussing it -- it might be promising.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do older platforms have a similar tool and a bigger user base?&lt;/strong&gt; If an older platform does the same thing, people might hesitate to adopt a newer platform. For example, marketers primarily use Stories on &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-vs-snapchat"&gt;In&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-vs-snapchat"&gt;stagram as opposed to Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/snapchat-marketing"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; pioneered the story, the Instagram interface and experience is something that a lot more people know, understand, and trust.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will my audiences understand how to use the platform?&lt;/strong&gt; It might be challenging to get a less tech-savvy person to join Snapchat or TikTok, but they might love a platform like Facebook or Twitter because the interfaces might be easier to understand. Pick platforms that your audience can easily use and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will audiences even be interested in the platform?&lt;/strong&gt; While a tech novice might not enjoy TikTok, a teenager might get bored on a platform like Facebook. In fact, younger people prefer &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/which-social-networks-should-you-focus-on"&gt;visual apps like TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and Instagram. While you want to pay attention to the level of adaptability, you also should pay attention to how your audience wants to consume media.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What type of content or post could we use to promote our brand on the platform?&lt;/strong&gt; You should always make a plan of action when considering or launching a social platform. If you can't come up with any interesting ways to market your specific product on a really niche platform, you might want to hold off on making an account. On the other hand, experimenting with different posting strategies could allow your brand to look creative and cool to the platform's audience.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you ultimately decide that you aren't ready to jump on to a new platform right now, and just want to focus on the bigger platforms, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/which-social-networks-should-you-focus-on"&gt;here's a guide to the different types of social media&lt;/a&gt; and how you can use them for your next marketing campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Deal With a Toxic Work Environment, According to Science [Infographic]</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-deal-with-toxic-work-environment</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-deal-with-toxic-work-environment" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/deal-toxic-work-environment-1.jpg" alt="deal-toxic-work-environment-1" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;A toxic work environment can&lt;a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-stress-affects-your-body-sharon-horesh-bergquist#review"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-stress-affects-your-body-sharon-horesh-bergquist#review"&gt;impact your physical health&lt;/a&gt;, mental health, and overall level of happiness at work. As a result, it can compromise the quality of work you produce -- which can negatively impact both your team, and your career.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A toxic work environment can&lt;a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-stress-affects-your-body-sharon-horesh-bergquist#review"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-stress-affects-your-body-sharon-horesh-bergquist#review"&gt;impact your physical health&lt;/a&gt;, mental health, and overall level of happiness at work. As a result, it can compromise the quality of work you produce -- which can negatively impact both your team, and your career.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Negativity in the workplace can manifest in a variety of forms -- including bullying, mismanagement, aggressiveness, and distrust among team members. If it makes you dread going to work each day, it's an issue that needs to be solved.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, if you're suffering in a toxic workplace, it's not your responsibility to fix it. The causes are typically partly systemic, and partly cultural -- alternatively, perhaps it's the behaviors of your colleagues or boss that leads to such negativity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to deal with it, you need to work on protecting yourself. Self-care, personal development, and certain choices around the workplace can help you form a protective barrier against the onslaught of negativity, while preparing yourself to find a better job. Being positive and supportive to colleagues who are similarly affected by this toxicity can help create a sense of collective resilience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the people at&lt;a href="https://resume.io/how-to-deal-with-a-toxic-work-environment"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://resume.io/how-to-deal-with-a-toxic-work-environment"&gt;resume.io&lt;/a&gt; have figured out some precise steps you can take to make these things happen -- and they've created a new visual guide to cope with a toxic work environment. Have a look through it, and start protecting yourself against negativity today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Digital Media is Killing TV Advertising</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-digital-media-is-killing-tv-advertising</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-digital-media-is-killing-tv-advertising" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/tv-advertising-digital-2.jpg" alt="tv-advertising-digital-2" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, research conducted by the Leichtman Research Group found that &lt;a href="https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/78-of-tv-households-subscribe-to-a-pay-tv-service/"&gt;78% of households still watch traditional satellite or cable TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2018, research conducted by the Leichtman Research Group found that &lt;a href="https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/78-of-tv-households-subscribe-to-a-pay-tv-service/"&gt;78% of households still watch traditional satellite or cable TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Looking at that statistic, you wouldn't think that TV viewing is on the decline -- but it is, and with it, TV ad spend.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instance, considering research from the same group in 2018, you'll see &lt;a href="https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/69-of-u-s-households-have-an-svod-service/"&gt;69% of homes in 2018 were subscribed to a video streaming service&lt;/a&gt; -- which is up from 52%, just two years prior.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, internet usage itself has risen to over four billion users since last year. That number encompasses over half of the global population, with China, India and the United States ranking ahead of all other countries in terms of internet users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/B-kc6_K67r8jblEH6huH_8NXrw_wg_Z7yXCZ1W9epcLvhF6QbE4fiyVyfhUXr2HklmwfVqNuda4trFZ4gjEqdoTzyc_-FaHHRcm8lbDtLwJR-buNv51I4bB5OykCy8100bjbzQ_r" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailywireless.org/internet/usage-statistics/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Traditional TV viewing has &lt;a href="https://www.marketingcharts.com/featured-24817"&gt;dropped dramatically since 2012&lt;/a&gt;, particularly among 18-24 year olds. In the next few years, we're going to continue to see a decline of TV viewing -- and with it, a steep drop-off of traditional TV advertising in favor of using digital media as the preferred advertising platform.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, I'm going to explain why.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Decline of TV Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;TV advertising spend actually &lt;a href="https://ark-invest.com/research/tv-ad-spending"&gt;climbed 16% from 2010 to 2017&lt;/a&gt;, according to analysis by ARK Investment Management. And yet, conversely, TV viewing &lt;a href="https://ark-invest.com/research/tv-ad-spending"&gt;decreased in that time by 20%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In years past, TV was the only form of media you could use to reach a massive market during prime hours -- but now, people aren't watching as much.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The way we see it, there are a few components to this shift.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First, a &lt;a href="https://www.hearts-science.com/reaching-the-unreachables/"&gt;study by Omnicom Media Group's Hearts &amp;amp; Science agency found&lt;/a&gt; that nearly half of Millennials and Gen Xers are no longer viewing video content on traditional TV.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they are choosing to view content on newer streaming platforms -- Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and YouTube TV, which have been taking over the viewing space.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, on average, they're &lt;a href="https://www.hearts-science.com/reaching-the-unreachables/"&gt;consuming 30 hours of video content&lt;/a&gt; on streaming platforms per week. This makes these generations "unreachable" through traditional advertising methods, particularly since most streaming platforms, like Netflix, don't &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-not-selling-advertising-streaming-1203270773/"&gt;allow brands to advertise&lt;/a&gt; on the site.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when these audiences &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; watch regular TV, they aren't solely engaged in the show -- for instance, on commercial breaks they're likely to pull out their phones or other devices, so they might not remember or watch TV commercials at all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If these losses continue as projected, by 2023 viewing hours could be less than half what they were in 2010, and cut in half again by the year 2028.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;a href="https://ark-invest.com/research/tv-ad-spending"&gt;ARK’s research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that if marketers begin to take these dropping viewing hours into account and continue to shift their budgets toward digital methods, the United States' TV ad revenue could plummet to less than half its current levels over the next 10 years.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Digital Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, online streaming platforms have been experiencing massive growth. For example, YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-tops-1-billion-hours-of-video-a-day-on-pace-to-eclipse-tv-1488220851"&gt;increased its viewership by more than 10X between 2010 and 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even social networks like &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/5/1/15509026/twitter-live-video-tv-shows"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; are creating their own versions of video streaming.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In addition, in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/us-digital-ad-spending-will-surpass-traditional-in-2019/"&gt;digital ad spending will surpass TV ad spend, and traditional ad spend, for the first time ever&lt;/a&gt;. It's also projected that by 2023, digital will exceed two-thirds of total media spending.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; exactly is this happening? Why the shift? Let's dive into that further. Here, I'll outline five reasons digital ad spending is surpassing traditional.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Digital media is cheaper.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The cost difference between TV advertising and &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/digital-marketing?_ga=2.170975776.1881249955.1561555949-2135633804.1548183013"&gt;digital marketing&lt;/a&gt; methods is tremendous. A 30-second TV ad -- which may or may not reach your ideal audience -- will cost you over one-third of a million dollars ... plus setup costs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, while you need to hire employees to conduct SEO and potentially invest in SEO products, SEO itself is free, and can help you organically reach your target audience over the long-term. PPC and email marketing have cheap set-ups, and could cost anywhere from a few cents per click to a few dollars.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, that sort of disparity -- while it makes sense logistically -- is fairly ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Digital marketing allows for better segmentation.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Traditional TV advertising lets you broadcast to anyone who turns on the channel. To reach a specific audience to whom your product will appeal, you need to guess what sort of TV programming could appeal to your ideal demographic -- it's difficult to apply or collect any audience-specific analytics.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With TV advertising, the closest you can get to understanding a TV channel's audience is through ratings like Nielsen ratings or the Gross Ratings Point. These ratings are used to estimate the percentage of the desired demographic on a particular channel through statistically relevant sampling.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The downside to TV ratings like Nielsen is that, 1) these are estimates, not exact numbers; and 2) as an advertiser, you still need to pay to broadcast to anyone who views that channel, not just your intended demographic. It's a wide-net strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Digital media methods, however, are able to mine personal data on a more individual level, allowing for dramatically greater personalization. You're searching for a "green Columbia jacket?" Well, my company has that jacket, and we've applied the right filter to catch your search term on Google instantly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you don't buy the jacket today, that's okay -- we can use retargeting to show you an ad on your social networks about our green Columbia jacket, and remind you of your interest in the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Plus, we can create different ads for different segments -- hikers looking for sturdy Columbia jackets in the summertime, versus skiers who need athletic cold-weather jackets.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;TV can't say the same -- it's estimates and wide-nets all around.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Digital marketing is more agile.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Leading off the last point, digital media advertising methods allow you to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-marketing-analytics"&gt;track, measure, and make adjustments&lt;/a&gt; necessary to optimize your ads -- in real time. Everything from adjusting a few words, a color, or a filter can be done quickly, and cheaply.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Every change you make to your digital marketing campaigns or content can be made quantifiable by tracking CTRs and conversion rates to identify exactly where something needs to be tweaked, and how -- and, again, you'll see quickly if you made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;TV ads, in contrast, need time to see if they'll pan out, and they can't be adjusted easily ... or affordably. You can make multiple versions upfront of the same advertisement to air in different regions, but beyond that, it's clumsy and expensive to make tweaks and adjustments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Video ads are online now, too.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;TV used to be the king of storytelling -- in a short span of time, you'd get a scene, a protagonist, a problem, and a solution. Internet initially just used banner ads, which, while annoying, were effective -- but only in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, digital advertisers had to figure something else out. Slowly, they started to determine more versatile methods -- images, images in slide decks, and video.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Users are already increasingly shifting toward the internet and internet content as their preferred method of entertainment. Online video ads are a powerful threat to TV because it's ultimately a familiar type of storytelling, and on the platform preferred by consumers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. Advertising follows attention.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, viewing has shifted from traditional media to digital. And ultimately, where attention shifts, advertising should follow. In 2019, brands will need to consider digital methods if they want to reach their target audience, many of whom are using online streaming services more than they're using their cable box.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why TV Is Still Around&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to play contrarian for a moment, here.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Digital media seems to be killing TV advertising, but maybe it's not -- or, at least not &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/research_proves_the_power_of_tv_advertising/40329"&gt;Research by WARC suggests that consumers actually pay more attention&lt;/a&gt; to ads on TV than they do on YouTube or Facebook. In fact, TV held more than twice the active viewing than YouTube, and 15 times more than Facebook.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, TV still works for advertising. It's often effective to diversify the channels on which you promote your products or services -- and TV is one of those channels. So, while digital media may be killing TV advertising's spot as the #1 channel, it likely won't go entirely by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, we're going to say it again -- where attention shifts, advertising follows. Despite research suggesting things aren't as dire for TV ads as you might think, the numbers are still pretty clear on at least one front: more consumers are shifting toward viewing content online.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This means, as marketers, you need to be devoting more of your budget to where your audience is. TV doesn't have to be cut entirely -- and probably shouldn't be -- but finding the right mix of digital and TV is critical for finding success in this new age of online-first viewing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ultimate Guide to Instagram Hashtags for 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-hashtags</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-hashtags" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/instagram-hashtags.jpg" alt="instagram-hashtags" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Did you know an Instagram post with at least one hashtag averages &lt;a href="http://get.simplymeasured.com/rs/simplymeasured2/images/InstagramStudy2014Q3.pdf"&gt;12.6% more engagement&lt;/a&gt; than a post with no hashtags?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Did you know an Instagram post with at least one hashtag averages &lt;a href="http://get.simplymeasured.com/rs/simplymeasured2/images/InstagramStudy2014Q3.pdf"&gt;12.6% more engagement&lt;/a&gt; than a post with no hashtags?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Hashtags are powerful. They can help your posts reach a target audience, attract followers in your niche, increase engagement, and develop a more positive and recognizable brand image.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing, though: with great power comes great responsibility (#spiderman).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hashtags can skyrocket your business to new heights, but if used too frequently or without a clear strategy in mind, they become pointless and inefficient, e.g.: #happy #superhappy #ecstatic #jumpingforjoy #whatsanothersynonym.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We want your business's Instagram posts to receive optimal engagement, so we've put together an ultimate guide for using Instagram hashtags in 2018. With this guide, you won't just attract followers -- you'll attract the &lt;em&gt;right &lt;/em&gt;followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Why are hashtags important?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hashtags are essentially Instagram's sorting process. With &lt;a href="https://www.socialpilot.co/blog/social-media-statistics"&gt;around 95 million photos&lt;/a&gt; posted on Instagram every day, it's difficult for Instagram to efficiently deliver the right content to the right people. Hashtags help your post get discovered by viewers most interested in seeing it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Krystal Gillespie, HubSpot's Social Media Community Manager, explains the importance of hashtags this way: "Hashtags are like a funnel. For instance, #marketing is incredibly broad and attracts all types of posts. We've found #digitalmarketing or #marketingmotivation gives us a more specific, targeted reach. The audience searching for these hashtags are also trying to narrow their search to what we offer related to Marketing, so we're actually reaching more of the right people."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, hashtags are a better way to categorize your posts. They help you reach a target audience, and more importantly, they help your target audience find you. These users are more likely to engage with your post because your post is exactly what they wanted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;Top Instagram Hashtags 2018&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#love&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#instagood&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#style&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#dogstagram&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#me&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#fashion&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#cute&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#tbt&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#foodporn&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#photooftheday&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#instamood&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#follow&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#iphonesia&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#food&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#motivation&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;#Instagramhub&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Adding one of the most popular Instagram hashtags to your post doesn't necessarily mean you'll see more interaction. Since the hashtags above are so popular, they are being used by millions of people, so your post will most likely be obscured by the competition. Narrowing your hashtag topic is important, but we'll get to that next.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the top Instagram hashtags of 2018.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. #love&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instagram users build their photo galleries on good feelings. For this reason, the #love hashtag is ever present next to the pics of friends, family, vacations, and beautiful scenery.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. #instagood&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Occurrences of this hashtag are inspired by the @instagood Instagram account, which scours the Instagram community for excellent photos and videos that are just too #instagood not to share. Add this hashtag to your content for a chance to be reposted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. #style&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This hashtag has more than &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/style/?hl=en"&gt;400 million posts associated with it&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the top tags in 2019. It's used for beautifully edited photos of outfits, vacations, luxury products, and anything aesthetically stunning. Tag #style on a gorgeous outfit inspiration or new product, and Instagram users looking to add a little glamour to their lives will find you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. #dogstagram&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We all know that the internet loves cute puppies, so it shouldn't be surprising when a hashtag for our beloved doggos trends on Instagram. It's always a good idea to include man's best friend in an Instagram post -- your followers will love it and you're almost guaranteed dozens of heart emojis in your comments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Hashtag%20%23dogstagram.png?width=759&amp;amp;name=Instagram%20Hashtag%20%23dogstagram.png" alt="Instagram Hashtag #dogstagram" width="759" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/dogstagram/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. #me&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is the quintessential selfie hashtag, indicating to the Instagram community that the photo it's captioning is a picture of you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. #fashion&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;People often turn to Instagram to see what styles are "in", looking at posts ranging from fashion week to everyday outfit inspirations. This means that a significant portion of the content on Instagram revolves around fashion -- in fact, there are more than &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fashion/?hl=en"&gt;700 million #fashion posts on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; today. You will find celebrities, luxury brands, clothes, makeup, and other aspirational images tagged with #fashion.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-instagram"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://instagram.com/p/B0OfdykBv80/embed/" width="425" height="505"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. #cute&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;#Cute puts your content in a pool of Instagram photos and videos that elicit "awes" from all over the Instaverse. If you think your puppy is the cutest puppy that ever lived, it deserves a photo with this esteemed hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. #tbt&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;#Tbt stands for "Throwback Thursday," and encourages Instagram users to post an old photo of themselves or an event they're reminiscing over. Everyone likes content from the good old days -- here's your hashtag for enjoying the nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. #foodporn&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I hope you're hungry! The #foodporn tag is brimming with mouthwatering posts of desserts, pizza, recipe videos, and so much more. This hashtag is for the best of the best when it comes to delectable treats on Instagram -- find the most original, delicious, and tantalizing food pictures on the internet under this hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-instagram"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://instagram.com/p/B0OXDjWgizB/embed/" width="425" height="505"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. #photooftheday&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Managing a business account? This hashtag is a surefire way to attract more followers and repeat visitors. If you plan to post daily content, all around a common theme, add the #photooftheday hashtag to increase your exposure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. #instamood&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;#Instamood is all about the vibe or emotion a photo or video elicits. Pretty scenery, a day at the beach, or a night out with good people were all prominent under the #instamood hashtag in 2018. Landscapes are a popular starting point when figuring out what to post on Instagram, according to &lt;a href="https://jumpermedia.co/27-cool-things-to-post-on-instagram-ideas-from-top-brands/"&gt;Jumper Media&lt;/a&gt;, and they fit into this hashtag perfectly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. #follow&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This hashtag -- currently tagged on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/follow/?hl=en"&gt;half a billion posts&lt;/a&gt; -- is a tactic used by public accounts looking to gain more followers. It's a ubiquitous tag, non-specific to any one type of content creator, so you'll see #follow on fashion accounts, travel blogs, makeup tutorials, celebrity fan pages, and much more. The idea is that if a user comes across content that they like on your explore page, they might be motivated to follow the account for more of that content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. #iphonesia&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;#Iphonesia is dedicated to the burgeoning community of Instagrammers in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;14. #food&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Meal pics are the bread and butter (no pun intended) of a people-oriented Instagram account -- and 2018 was no exception. Use the #food hashtag to caption your next delicious Instagram photo.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;15. #motivation&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, #MondayMotivation encourages inspiring quotes and messages to help people start the week off on the right foot. On Instagram, the #motivation hashtag has come to caption anything from a photo of a user after a big gym session, to a computer screen right before he or she gets to work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The above 10 hashtags might have helped define Instagram over the last year, but there are still plenty more that end up trending &lt;i&gt;every y&lt;/i&gt;ear. The following hashtags can help inspire photos and videos that Instagram users always seem to find captivating -- and are sure to in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;16. #Instagramhub&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This hashtag isn't specific to one type of post -- #instagramhub is a place for active Instagram users to demonstrate their presence on the platform and reach larger audiences. By including this popular hashtag, influencers on Instagram are able to connect with as many users as possible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Hashtag%20%23beautiful.png?width=762&amp;amp;name=Instagram%20Hashtag%20%23beautiful.png" alt="Instagram Hashtag #beautiful" width="762" style="width: 762px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/beautiful/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. #travel&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Away for the weekend? Show your followers where you are, using this hashtag to indicate you're traveling somewhere new.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. #fitness&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Get in on a trending community of workout warriors with photos and videos from your best exercise sessions, using the #fitness hashtag to share the moment.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. #happy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best part of feeling good is sharing that sunshine with others. The #happy group of posts is full of radiant people and lighthearted content that brings us joy. Tag a photo of a cute kitten or one of yourself after getting a promotion with #happy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. #repost&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-repost-on-instagram?_ga=2.105802755.1868657728.1540846407-814765080.1538488659"&gt;Reposting&lt;/a&gt; is a common function on Instagram that allows you to share content from other users, with credit back to the original user. Use the hashtag, #repost, to tell others on Instagram that you were inspired by this photo or video.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. #igers&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;#Igers is short for "Instagram users." If you've got a photo or video that encompasses the Instagram community, show your solidarity with this colloquial hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. #photography&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Instagram is a photo sharing media, so it makes sense that there are some stunning and artistic images shared in #photography. Instagram is unique in that a user could be scrolling through the #photography posts and see National Geographic and professional photos next to amateur photographers.&lt;span style="color: #33475b;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-instagram"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://instagram.com/p/B0OdNt_AZsu/embed/" width="425" height="505"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. #instadaily&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This hashtag is similar to #photooftheday -- one of the most popular hashtags of 2018 above this list -- and is perfect for Instagrammers who post every day.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. #bestoftheday&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The #bestoftheday tag offers a glimpse into the massive amount of varied content that is posted to Instagram every day. Here, you'll find some of the most noteworthy images on the platform -- images of beautiful spots around the world, award-winning photos, yummy recipes, adorable animals, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. #followforfollow&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Interested in building a fast list of followers on Instagram? #Followforfollow tells everyone who browses this hashtag that you'll follow users who choose to follow you. This hashtag is always trending highly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. #likeforlike&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;#Likeforlike is similar to the #followforfollow hashtag explained above. Use this hashtag if you want to increase engagement on your Instagram account, telling users that you'll like their photo or video if they like yours.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. #tweegram&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of multi-platform sharing across social media sites, and in #tweegram, you'll find images taken from Twitter, Pinterest, and more. #Tweegram is best known for quotes, screenshots of Tweets, and memes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;14. #summer&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The summertime is the best season to enjoy fun vacations, fruity drinks, and time by the pool. This tag is full of Instagram users enjoying the long summertime hours on the beach or showing off the breezy outfits keeping them cool under the hot #summer sun.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-instagram"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://instagram.com/p/B0Osoc1AGcE/embed/" width="425" height="505"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;15. #nofilter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instagram offers so many different filters to help enhance photos, it's practically assumed that any picture on Instagram has been edited. But if you're posting a pic that was beautiful all by itself, let the world know that this gem didn't need a filter to look so nice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;16. #ootd&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;#Ootd stands for "Outfit of the Day," a hashtag dedicated to Instagram users who love showing off new clothing and styles on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;17. #instafood&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This popular tag is different from other food hashtags because it accompanies food pictures that are gorgeous, creative, and, most importantly, worthy of Instagram. Instagram posts are&amp;nbsp; known for being aesthetically appealing, and #instafood is no different. Use this tag if you're posting a photo of a colorful, unique, and sumptuous dish!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;18. #fun&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If it's not fun, it's not Instagram-worthy. Make it known to millions of Instagram users that you had a blast in your latest photo or video with this popular hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;How to Use Hashtags on Instagram for Business&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Keep your hashtags organized.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Figure out your magic number.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Narrow your hashtags.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Research what other people are hashtagging.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Test out related hashtags.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Follow your own hashtag.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Create a brand campaign hashtag.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Keep your hashtags organized.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To create an efficient hashtag system, you can use Excel or an Instagram analytics tool. If you choose an excel sheet, you'll need to manually keep track of which hashtags you use, how often, and which ones correlate to your most popular posts. Over time, you'll see relationships between certain hashtags and your most popular posts, and this can help you decide which hashtags work best for your brand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have a more advanced social media team, you might want to consider a tool like &lt;a href="https://pro.iconosquare.com/"&gt;Iconosquare&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically stores top hashtags and provides reports on which hashtags reach the most people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For smaller businesses with limited budgets, Krystal Gillespie says that, "an excel sheet is the best way to start. Once you get more advanced I would highly recommend using a tool to track the data. A manual system can get overwhelming when you're posting three times a day and using about 20 hashtags per post."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Figure out your magic number.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Most top brands -- &lt;a href="http://get.simplymeasured.com/rs/simplymeasured2/images/InstagramStudy2014Q3.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRolua%252FAZKXonjHpfsX57%252BwtX6a2lMI%252F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4CTsViI%252BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFQrDEMal41bgNWRM%253D"&gt;91% of them&lt;/a&gt;, to be exact -- use seven or fewer hashtags per post, so it's easy to assume that's the magic number for everyone … right? Krystal explains that this isn't always the case: She told me HubSpot has been more successful with hashtags ranging in the low 20s.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The point is, you can't know how many hashtags work best for you until you test it. For HubSpot, it took the team several months to find a number that worked best, and during our trial period, we ranged from seven to 30. Give yourself the same flexibility for trial and error.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Narrow your hashtags.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are two big reasons more specific, smaller-volume hashtags are better for your brand: first, you can compete in a smaller pool. HubSpot, for example, doesn't typically use the hashtag #marketing because it's too broad. If you search #marketing, you'll find pictures of restaurants, inspirational quotes, before-and-after hair style pictures, and memes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The randomness of #marketing leads me to the second reason specific hashtags are a good idea: as a user, I'm more likely to find what I need if I search for something specific, and when your business comes up for my specific search request, I'm more likely to be happy with what I found.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Krystal explains: "Keeping a hashtag close to the interests of your brand really helps. We try to use hashtags tailored for a specific topic and then narrow it down further -- for instance, we'd use #SEOTips if our marketing post was mostly about SEO."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: #dogs is more popular, but it has a wide demographic. If I search #goldenretrieverpuppies and I find your post, I'm more likely to engage with it because it's exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Research what other people are hashtagging.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An easy way to generate hashtag ideas is to make a list of your followers or competitors and research what they're hashtagging on their own photos. It can also be particularly helpful to research what influencers in your industry are hashtagging -- by definition, influencers are people with a large social media following, so they must be doing something right.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. Test out related hashtags.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you type a hashtag into Instagram's search bar, Instagram shows you related hashtags in the scroll-down menu. Instagram also delivers related hashtags on the next page after you click on a hashtag. This is a simple way to create a longer list of hashtags to try out.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. Follow your own hashtag.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another way to use Instagram hashtags for your marketing purposes is to follow your own hashtag. Krystal explains, "On Instagram I actually follow the hashtag #hubspot so I can find anyone who talks about us and connect with them. As long as your account isn't private, people will be able to find you via the hashtag."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Following your own hashtag is an effective way to engage with other people talking about your brand and develop better relationships with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. Create a brand campaign hashtag.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is the trickiest item on the list, but if done successfully, it can pay off big time. Some businesses have successfully attracted followers by creating their own campaign hashtag. A campaign hashtag needs to be funny, clever, or at least memorable in order to work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Campaign hashtags are particularly useful for promoting a new product or upcoming event, or even just inspiring people. Red Bull, for example, encouraged followers to post Red Bull pictures with a &lt;a href="http://shortyawards.com/7th/putacanonit"&gt;#putacanonit hashtag&lt;/a&gt; (see what I mean about clever?). LuLuLemon, rather than running a more traditional ad campaign, developed a positive connotation for their brand by asking followers to post real, active pictures of themselves with a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/908352068/lululemon-athletica/"&gt;#sweatlife hashtag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've covered the importance of using Instagram hashtags for your business, you might be wondering how to search for Instagram hashtags within the app, or how to use the search function to find related ideas. If you're unsure of the technical process for hashtag searching, here's how:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;How to Search Hashtags on Instagram&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To search hashtags on Instagram, tap the magnifying glass at the bottom of your screen, then tap the search bar at the top. Selecting the "Tags" option will enable you to search hashtags and related hashtags based on the popularity of each one.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Open Instagram and tap the search icon.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instagram &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; you to use hashtags, and has made it extremely easy to find the perfect ones for your post. To start, open the Instagram app on your mobile device and tap the magnifying glass at the bottom of your screen.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/search-instagram.png?width=350&amp;amp;name=search-instagram.png" width="350" style="width: 350px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Instagram home screen with magnifying glass icon and search bar highlighted in red"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Tap the search bar at the top of your screen.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The search screen on your Instagram might first send you to a newsfeed-style page with suggested content based on topics you've demonstrated an interest in on social media. To switch to a hashtag search, tap the search bar at the top of this page, as shown in the screenshot above.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Tap "Tags."&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you've tapped the search bar at the top of your screen, Instagram will give you four options with which to filter your search. Instagram refers to hashtags as simply "Tags," as shown in the screenshot below. Tap this "Tags" option, then tap the search bar above it, and begin searching topics for which you want to find a trending hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to include the pound sign (#) in your search -- your results will be the same with or without it -- but you will need to use this pound sign in the caption of your photo once you choose a hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/search-hashtags-instagram.png?width=350&amp;amp;name=search-hashtags-instagram.png" width="350" style="width: 350px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Search page where you can search hashtags on Instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Browse hashtags based on post count and current content.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Voila! You should see multiple options for hashtags based on your search. Browse around at each related hashtag that Instagram suggests for you -- you might find that a hashtag with slightly fewer posts includes photos or videos that are more in line with the content you're posting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Happy hashtagging!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;a class="close"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;img src="https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Finstagram-hashtags&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" style="min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; "&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;If you're not a total Instagram addict like me, you might go a day or two without checking your app. And when you check your feed, you might notice that some posts from friends were shared mere minutes ago, while others might be a few days old.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, what gives? Why isn't your Instagram feed chronological anymore?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you're not a total Instagram addict like me, you might go a day or two without checking your app. And when you check your feed, you might notice that some posts from friends were shared mere minutes ago, while others might be a few days old.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, what gives? Why isn't your Instagram feed chronological anymore?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;Like many other social networks, Instagram's algorithm changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;In this post, we'll give you a quick rundown of what's new with the algorithm, along with tips on how to create the most engaging posts possible to get more comments on Instagram -- which help you jump higher in the feed and get discovered by new users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Guide to the Instagram Feed Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In June 2016, &lt;a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/145322772067/160602-news"&gt;Instagram announced&lt;/a&gt; it was changing its algorithm to show users content they cared about first -- no matter when it was posted. This could make it tougher for social media marketers to get organic Instagram posts seen because most users were missing &lt;a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/145322772067/160602-news"&gt;70% of the content&lt;/a&gt; on their feeds.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Facebook began to prioritize posts of users' friends and family in 2018, &lt;a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/03/22/changes-to-improve-your-instagram-feed/"&gt;Instagram followed suit.&lt;/a&gt; Its algorithms began prioritizing brands and advertisements less heavily.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But brand posts with natural engagement can sometimes defeat these algorithms. There are a few factors that influence a post's ranking on the Instagram feed, and the number of likes and comments a post achieves is one of them. &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-will-go-into-instagrams-algorithm-2016-3"&gt;Here's what matters&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to ranking on an Instagram user's feed:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The number of Likes and comments a post has&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If that user has interacted with your content in the past&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;How recently you posted&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your organic Instagram posts get engagement from your followers, it creates a positive feedback loop: the more people like and comment on a post, the greater likelihood it will appear on the &lt;a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/get-brand-instagrams-explore-page/"&gt;Explore tab&lt;/a&gt;, where users who don't already follow you can check out your popular content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Before we jump into strategies for attracting more comments, there are a few things you need to do:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Make your account public.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Make sure new followers can find your content by opening your account. Navigate to your profile, tap the Settings gear icon in the upper right-hand corner, and toggle the Private Account button to the Off position.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-public-account.png?width=320&amp;amp;name=instagram-public-account.png" alt="How to use Instagram Options o make your private account public" width="320" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 320px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Enable push notifications.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Turn on push notifications so you can quickly reply to or like your followers' comments. Remember, the more users interact with your account, the higher on their feeds your content will appear.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to your profile, tap the Settings gear icon in the upper right-hand corner, tap Push Notification Settings, and choose which Instagram actions you want to be notified for.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-notifications-1.png?width=410&amp;amp;name=instagram-notifications-1.png" width="410" style="width: 410px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Instagram Options page with Push Notification Settings highlighted"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instgram-notifications-2.png?width=315&amp;amp;name=instgram-notifications-2.png" alt="How to adjust your Instagram notification settings" width="315" style="width: 315px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Curate engaging content.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;People aren't going to comment on uninteresting content, so enlist one team member to manage the scheduling and editing of Instagram content, but open it up to a larger team to source different photos, videos, and ideas to keep your Instagram feed fresh and interesting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Develop an Instagram editorial calendar.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Figure out an Instagram publishing cadence that works for you -- and we recommend posting no more than once per day. Remember, timing is a factor in the algorithm, so you don't want posts from earlier in the day to get lost in the shuffle. Download our &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar"&gt;social media content calendar&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of what you're posting across other social platforms so you're not repetitive and you're covering all of your bases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that we're all on the same page, let's dive into strategies for getting more comments (and likes) on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;13 Ways to Get More Comments on Instagram&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Host a giveaway or contest.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A fun and easy way to get followers to comment on your Instagram posts is by hosting an Instagram contest or giveaway. You could post on Instagram promoting the contest, then ask users to enter by commenting on your post. You could make your contest a weeklong campaign, where users have to comment each day. You could even incorporate user-generated content (UGC) and ask followers to post their own photos and to tag/mention your brand in the post.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of an Instagram contest we ran for our attendees at &lt;a href="https://www.inbound.com/"&gt;INBOUND 2016&lt;/a&gt;, HubSpot's annual marketing and sales event:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMo3lPpjNZ_/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7&amp;amp;wp=658#%7B%22ci%22%3A3%2C%22os%22%3A13226.735%7D" width="300" height="641" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;Social Media Examiner has a great guide for running Instagram contests -- &lt;a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/run-successful-instagram-contest/"&gt;check it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Host an Instagram takeover.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instagram takeovers are a fun way to get fresh content on your Instagram and to work with colleagues and influencers. They're a smart way to generate more Instagram engagement, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Takeovers involve one Instagram user taking over another's feed, usually for a day, and posting from their point of view. Takeovers are often done from the perspective of:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A colleague&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;An influencer&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Another organization in your industry&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These takeovers help generate more Instagram comments whether it takes place on your account or you're taking over another account. Here's an example of a takeover we hosted with our friends over at WeWork. WeWork was able to share brand and member stories to a whole new audience of HubSpot's engaged followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQfnT35jz_P/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7&amp;amp;wp=658#%7B%22ci%22%3A4%2C%22os%22%3A13231.555000000002%7D" width="300" height="576" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;WeWork closed the takeover with a call-to-action (CTA) to follow its Instagram account -- where new followers will start liking and commenting on new posts. And over at HubSpot, we enjoyed comments from WeWork fans and others interested in the takeover.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQg2F63j1fU/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7&amp;amp;wp=658#%7B%22ci%22%3A5%2C%22os%22%3A13237.965%7D" width="300" height="576" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;Takeovers are a win-win for hosts and guests. Learn how to host one with &lt;a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/instagram-takeover"&gt;help from Buffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Ask users to engage in the comments.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A simple way to get more Instagram comments is to ask for them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Post content on Instagram that lends itself to sharing, and ask users to answer a question or tag their friends and coworkers in the comments. It's a fun and easy way to interact with your audience, and it helps you garner more comments, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of an Instagram post we shared in which we asked our followers a question. You can caption posts with simple questions like "Agree or disagree?" or "What's your advice?" to prompt responses and earn more comments.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt; 
 &lt;div style="padding: 16px;"&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRsrYCCDFKa/" style="background: #FFFFFF; line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;"&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; 
    &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;
     &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="padding: 19% 0;"&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="padding-top: 8px;"&gt; 
    &lt;div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;"&gt;
     View this post on Instagram
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;"&gt; 
    &lt;div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div style="margin-left: 8px;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;4. Post something funny, surprising, or provocative.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In a study of what makes content go viral, research revealed some of the most viral internet moments also provoked &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2013/10/research-the-emotions-that-make-marketing-campaigns-go-viral"&gt;high-arousal emotions&lt;/a&gt;. Among the most common were posts that created anticipation, surprised the viewer, and provoked curiosity and uncertainty. Emotions that incited feelings of joy were also among the most common, so think about content you could share on Instagram that makes people feel an emotion so strongly that they're compelled to comment on it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Is there content you could post about a surprising fact, a happy moment, or an intriguing industry trend? It doesn't need to be specifically about your brand, either -- content that's enjoyable for a broad audience will likely attract more comments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It can be silly, too -- here's our teaser video for our April Fool's Day prank about "gorilla" marketing that attracted a lot of attention -- while building anticipation and a sense of surprise.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;

  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hubspot/" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;"&gt; HubSpot&lt;/a&gt; (@hubspot) on Mar 31, 2017 at 1:11pm PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;5. Post videos.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Time spent viewing videos on Instagram &lt;a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/141905496242/160329-video"&gt;increased 40%&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and now, users can post videos up to one minute in length. Post this engaging content to get followers to stop scrolling through their busy Instagram feeds and watch your video -- and make sure it's intriguing. Your audience wants &lt;a href="https://research.hubspot.com/reports/the-future-of-content-marketing"&gt;more video content&lt;/a&gt; -- especially on social media -- so if you share something compelling and ask viewers to comment on it in the caption, they'll most likely do it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. Use relevant hashtags.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you post your content with relevant, popular Instagram hashtags, your posts appear in searches for those hashtags and the Explore tab. In fact, posts with at least one hashtag typically attain more than &lt;a href="http://get.simplymeasured.com/rs/simplymeasured2/images/InstagramStudy2014Q3.pdf"&gt;12% more engagement&lt;/a&gt;. Influencers and interested users might organically comment when they see you talking about topics they're also interested in, or you could combine some of the strategies above to generate engagement.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ask followers how they celebrated &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sundayfunday/"&gt;#SundayFunday&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledge a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/throwbackthursday/"&gt;#ThrowbackThursday&lt;/a&gt;, or use one of the hundreds of hashtags relevant to your industry or your content to get new audience members involved in the conversation. We did this with Earth Day hashtags in the example below:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BTMP0DMDoHO/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7&amp;amp;wp=447#%7B%22ci%22%3A3%2C%22os%22%3A13115.155%7D" width="300" height="693" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;Here's a guide to &lt;a href="https://later.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-using-instagram-hashtags/"&gt;finding and using Instagram hashtags&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a massive list of the &lt;a href="https://www.shortstack.com/158-most-popular-hashtags-for-instagram-marketing-and-more-2017/"&gt;most popular hashtags&lt;/a&gt; you can use.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. Publish at the right time of day.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="https://coschedule.com/blog/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/"&gt;a lot of debate&lt;/a&gt; over the best time of day to post on social media, and that's because the answer varies depending on your industry, your followers, and what type of content you're posting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our best advice is to test out your engagement rates on Instagram when you post at different times throughout the week, and determine your publishing schedule based on the results.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's bright and early on Monday morning or later in the afternoon, try to figure out the time when your followers are more willing to stop and leave a comment to maximize the engagement of your posts each day. Use a &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar"&gt;social media content calendar&lt;/a&gt; to track scheduling and results.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. Post photos of people's faces.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let's face it -- selfies are fun. And as it turns out, they're good for your Instagram strategy, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of &lt;a href="http://www.news.gatech.edu/2014/03/20/face-it-instagram-pictures-faces-are-more-popular"&gt;more than 1 million Instagram posts&lt;/a&gt; by Georgia Institute of Technology and Yahoo Labs found that posts with human faces are 32% more likely to attract comments -- and 38% more likely to garner likes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a ton of insight into &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this is, but the researchers suspected that it's partly because faces are effective sources of nonverbal communication that people respond to -- even as infants.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Post Instagram content featuring selfies, group shots, and candid photos, and see if your audience likes the human side of your brand, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of how HubSpot incorporated Ellen Degeneres' face into an inspirational quote post:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt; 
 &lt;div style="padding: 16px;"&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwegCrwgPE6/" style="background: #FFFFFF; line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;"&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; 
    &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;
     &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="padding: 19% 0;"&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="padding-top: 8px;"&gt; 
    &lt;div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;"&gt;

    &lt;div style="margin-left: 8px;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);"&gt;

      &amp;nbsp;

     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);"&gt;

      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwegCrwgPE6/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;Collect data.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;9. Post photos of animals.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a lot of research to back this one up, but you know as well as I do that animals on social media are powerful. Animals have been &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/from-cuteoverload-to-social-petworks-adorable-animals-are-taking-over-the-web/"&gt;popular on the web&lt;/a&gt; for a long time, and &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3060615/the-weird-and-wonderful-world-of-instagram-pet-influencers"&gt;animal influencers&lt;/a&gt; can earn just as much money as human influencers on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether you have animals in your office or a cute picture of a coworker's pet, try posting lighter, fun content on Instagram accompanied by a furry friend to see if your audience likes commenting on animals, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's a great example where an Instagram user tells people to tag someone that loves puppies:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;

   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; 
    &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;
     &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="padding: 19% 0;"&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"&gt;

      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div style="margin-left: 8px;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div style="margin-left: auto;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8SDCnlO41/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;Look at this donut &#x1f60d; Tag someone who needs to see this cutie &#x1f497; Follow @rarepups for more! &#x1f4f8; @balinesepug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/rarepups/" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;"&gt; Cutest Puppies &#x1f415;&lt;/a&gt; (@rarepups) on Jul 15, 2019 at 8:09am PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;10. Respond to the comments you get.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Just like other forms of social media, responding to comments can give your audience &lt;a href="/marketing/community-management-expert-advice"&gt;a sense of community&lt;/a&gt; and make you look like you're actually interested in what they have to say. When users get a comment in response, they might continue the comment thread.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when others see that your account is responding to comments, they might comment on the post as well to join in on the discussion or ask a question about your post.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. Use relevant emojis to make captions eye-catching.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While hashtags work to pull your post into searches, emojis will gravitate people's eyes to your captions. More eyes on your captions might mean more engagement, comments, and likes for the overall post.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When using emojis, be sure they make sense for what you are posting and seem appropriate for your company. Two to three emojis can be colorful and interesting, but don't go overboard with too many of them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example where HubSpot accompanied an infographic with a caption that had an emoji in it:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt; 
 &lt;div style="padding: 16px;"&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ByiArfxl_us/" style="background: #FFFFFF; line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;"&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; 
    &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;
     &amp;nbsp;
    &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="padding: 19% 0;"&gt;
    &amp;nbsp;
   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;"&gt;

      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);"&gt;

    &lt;div style="margin-left: 8px;"&gt;

     &lt;div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);"&gt;

      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
     &lt;div style="width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);"&gt;
      &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;/div&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt; 
   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
  &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ByiArfxl_us/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;The estimated data that's created in ONE MINUTE on the Internet &#x1f92f; Every minute, your customers could be singing your praises.

  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hubspot/" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;"&gt; HubSpot&lt;/a&gt; (@hubspot) on Jun 10, 2019 at 6:46am PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;12. Post more frequently.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like many other social media platforms, posting more frequently will make your account look active and up-to-date. If you only post once in a while, your posts might get drowned out by others in the Instagram feed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you post regularly and &lt;a href="/marketing/best-times-post-pin-tweet-social-media-infographic"&gt;at optimized times of the day&lt;/a&gt;, more people will see your posts. This could result in more people following you and ultimately commenting or reacting to your regular posts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. Promote a future Q&amp;amp;A and ask fans to comment with their questions.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have features like Instagram Stories and IGTV, we can host and promote live Q&amp;amp;A's which might be published with these tools. If you're planning to interview someone over a live feed, publish a few standard posts to promote the event.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For each promotional post, ask users to comment with a question that they'd like to ask the person who's being interviewed. Depending on the interview subject, you might see a flood of question comments from users. Along with more comments, this strategy will also allow your followers to feel like they're directly engaging with and contributing to your content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Engagement Is Key&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Likes, comments, and video views are valuable on Instagram because they influence where your posts sit in the feed. Additionally, your content will be discoverable on the Explore tab if a lot of users interact with your posts -- so test out these methods for attracting more responses on Instagram.

      <title>How HubSpot's Paid Team Leverages Their CRM</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/paid-ads-crm</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/paid-ads-crm" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/paid-ads-crm-1.jpg" alt="paid-ads-crm-1" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, advertisers have an endless list of tools at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, advertisers have an endless list of tools at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we might build our ads directly within Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google. Perhaps we have a budgeting tool that helps us properly allocate our ad spend. Additionally, maybe we use a tool like SEMRush to do keyword research.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There's a number of interesting reporting options out there. And I'm willing to bet when you're working on your ads strategy, you're leveraging much more than just the tools within the social media networks to find success.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We're no different here at HubSpot. Everything from keyword research tools to Microsoft Excel and &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/ads/get-started-with-ads"&gt;HubSpot's own ads tool&lt;/a&gt; is booted up to aid us in reaching you with the perfect ad at exactly the right moment in your buyer's journey.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But when people ask me, "What tool has the biggest impact on your ads strategy?" -- without a doubt, it’s our CRM. Here, I'm going to explain why.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Advertisers Should Leverage Their CRM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When I take a look at my most successful ad campaigns, they have a few things in common.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First, they're highly targeted. I'm not just blasting an ad out to any random group. Instead, I'm taking a look at our CRM data, and using it to create very specific segments of leads that will go into my audiences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Second, my ad and the offer behind it is tailored to the audience I'm targeting. I don't ask every single lead to buy our software, and I don't target people who are ready to speak to our sales team with HubSpot Academy Lessons or introductory blog posts. Knowing where a lead is in their buyer's journey, what content they've already interacted with, and what touchpoints they've already had with our brand is critical for success.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Third -- and maybe most importantly -- my most successful ads have clear next steps outlined for each lead that converts. You don't see ROI on your ad spend if you don't continue to work with the leads that come in through your ads. Whether you'll pass them off to the sales team for direct outreach, or enter them into a nurturing flow, next steps need to be outlined from the start when devising an ad campaign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These three components are hallmarks of any sound &lt;a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/journey-based-advertising"&gt;journey-based advertising strategy&lt;/a&gt;. If I feel confident about those three components of my ad campaign -- my targeting, my offer, and my lead nurturing -- then we push forward.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is where a CRM comes into play. A CRM is vital for helping ensure each of those three components are working in sync.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your CRM gives you a full overview of your customer's experience with your brand. No tool is better for gathering deep insights on your leads. With these insights, you can start to create ad campaigns that feel personalized to each person who interacts with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can use your CRM to create better alignment between your marketing and sales teams to ensure everyone has complete insights into which campaigns your customers are interacting with.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Every interaction, both online and offline, will start to feel like a natural next step along the buyer's journey. In short, the CRM is an advertiser's dream.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But how do you properly use it to work seamlessly with you ad strategy?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Your CRM in Your Ad Targeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your ad has no chance of being successful if you don't get your targeting right. Your ad content could be incredibly high-quality and engaging, but if you're targeting the wrong group of people, it's all for nothing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your targeting options are extensive. At the highest level, you can target your ads using either third-party data or &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/first-party-data"&gt;first-party data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, third-party data is aggregated data on large groups of people made available on advertising platforms. First-party data, on the other hand, is information that you've collected directly from your customers. Maybe it’s information they've submitted on a lead ad form, or the specific blog posts that they're visiting on your site. Because this data comes directly from your customers, it's extremely powerful when leveraged in your audiences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your CRM aggregates all this first-party data together into one place. Essentially, it's a one-stop shop for everything you need to create highly targeted audiences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When I'm &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/ads/create-ads-audiences-in-hubspot"&gt;creating audiences for HubSpot's ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, I'm constantly leveraging data within our CRM. I do this to ensure the ads you see are contextual, and relevant -- not just promoting HubSpot for the sake of doing so. It's a better experience for you, and it ensures we're spending our ad dollars wisely.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, we have two groups of leads -- those who download a piece of content on HubSpot.com or subscribe to our blog, and those who sign up for our free tools. From these two "base groups", we can start layering on additional information.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For the leads who subscribed to our blog, we might look at what content they're regularly consuming, or information we know about the company they work for, in order to ensure the ads they see reflect the topics around which they've demonstrated interest.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if we know we have a group of blog subscribers who frequently read our Sales blog -- &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; run a Sales team at mid-sized software companies -- chances are they could be interested in a Sales Hub case study about a current customer who looks just like them. We could even go a step further and see who has visited our Sales Hub product page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In just a few simple steps, we're able to take a group of leads who are interested in our content, and use the data in our CRM to create a highly targeted audience for an upcoming ad campaign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For free users of our software, CRM data is just as valuable for ads targeting. For this group, information on their job roles and the content they're consuming is just as valuable, but we can also start to explore how they're using our product. Just like we track website activity within our CRM, we also track product usage.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone signed up for our free CRM, I'll look at how often they use the tool. If they're actively using the tool and seeing value, we might decide not to target ads at them. If we think they'd find value in our paid product based on their product usage, we might target them with ads that are specific to which tools they use the most.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, If they aren't using the CRM at all, we might explore how we can help them find value in the tool. To do this, we'll mine our CRM for information on what led to them to signing up for the free tools in the first place. Were they looking for a way to manage their deals pipeline, or were they interested in exploring our free email marketing tool? Knowing this, we can start to recommend educational content through HubSpot Academy, which can help them find success within the tool.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, let's not forget about the power of &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/product-updates/now-live-lookalike-audiences-available-within-ads"&gt;lookalike audiences&lt;/a&gt; or exclusionary audiences. A lookalike audience is an audience type provided by the networks -- essentially, a network like Facebook will take one of your existing audiences and go out and serve your ad to similar individuals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lookalikes are powerful, and they automatically expand your advertising reach. Best of all, they become more powerful when paired with highly targeted audiences built off CRM data.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's also critical you're strategic with how you use exclusion audiences. These can be used in a number of different ways. For example, almost every ad I run excludes our current paying customers. There are also key events that a lead could take, where I'll hold off on targeting them for a few weeks at a time to ensure we're not negatively impacting their buyer's journey. By doing this, I'm making sure I'm spending my ads budget wisely and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Remember, lookalikes can also be used for audience exclusion. For example, we've created lookalikes in the past off of lists of leads that weren't performing well, and excluded them from our ads targeting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The targeting strategies above are only possible through leveraging the data we've collected within our CRM. In practice, we'll start with broad groups of leads, and continue to layer on audience conditions, filters, and lookalikes until we've reached a group of leads in our CRM that we believe will be highly interested in the ads we have to offer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging Your CRM in Your Follow-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Too many people I speak with about ads talk about an ad campaign as an isolated marketing action -- something that occurs independently from your email marketing, your content marketing, or even your sales process. This couldn't be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Few things can hamper your success with digital ads like ignoring the context under which someone will see your ad.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, consider this -- what if in the same day, one of your leads has an ad targeted at them, a marketing email sent to them, and a sales rep call them? Chances are that lead is sick of hearing from you. What's even worse is if the ad, email, and sales call all speak to different offers. Not creating alignment across each interaction your leads and customers have with your brand is a quick way to drive potential business away.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, your CRM gives you everything you need to create ads that fit perfectly into every stage of your buyer's journey. By leveraging your CRM, you can see how each lead interacts with your content across all channels, ensuring you don't miss obvious opportunities or overwhelm your leads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your CRM is useful when crafting your ads strategy to align with other marketing efforts, but it becomes essential when determining how you'll follow-up with and nurture the leads that convert on your ads. Each lead's experience will be unique, and the follow up that they receive after converting on your ad should reflect their experience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if they're downloading an e-book through your ad, ensuring that they receive that content offer is step one. But what if that's the third e-book they've downloaded this month? The nurturing flow that someone enters should look a lot different for a first time e-book downloader compared to someone who regularly interacts with your content, and shows high-buying intent.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HubSpot customer &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies/airstream"&gt;Airstream&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of leveraging their CRM data to ensure their customers receive follow-up that is relevant and actionable for them. Once a lead converts on one of their ads, they use CRM data to send an automated follow-up email -- delivering not only the content offer promised within the ad, but the location of their nearest Airstream dealer. Without leveraging their CRM, Airstream's follow-up wouldn't be as contextualized to each person who converts on their ads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We use lead scoring within our CRM to ensure leads that convert on our ads receive a follow-up message tailored to their experience with our brand. Based on their score, they might enter into a nurturing campaign, or get passed to our sales team. The experience will be different for each lead, but by leveraging the CRM, we're able to ensure that our teams are aligned, and everyone who interacts with that lead has full insight into what their experience with our brand has been so far.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Your CRM to Determine ROI &amp;amp; Ad Spend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the CRM is essential for helping us calculate the ROI of our ad spend. One of the great things about running your marketing and sales efforts out of the same tool, is that ROI calculations are simple.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Attributing an ad campaign to a closed deal can be done without having to hop between multiple systems, helping you avoid mistakes when measuring the success of your ad spend.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when I'm calculating ROI, I often exclude the three most recent months of leads that converted on my ads. Why? Because those leads just entered the system. They're still being nurtured into SQLs, and they haven't had enough time to close. Figure out how long your sales process usually takes, and consider excluding the leads, and the ad spend that brought them into your CRM, from your ROI calculation until later on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another piece of data within your CRM that is invaluable to advertisers is conversion data. I use this to help me strategically plan my ads budget. When determining ad spend, it's important to keep the ROI of your ad spend in mind. The problem is that far too often, you might not have enough purchase data to determine what your ads budget should be. If this is the case, take a look at a combination of your sales and marketing data captured in your CRM.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instance, let's say you know your sales team can convert one out of every 10 leads that convert on a form, and you know that about 20% of your website visitors will convert on a form.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Doing some simple math, you can determine that you'll need 50 clicks on your ads to generate one new customer. If you also leverage your CRM to understand what that one customer is worth to you, or their lifetime value, you can start to make smarter, more accurate decisions on what your ad spend should be.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ads are one of the most powerful tools for a marketer, but only when executed properly. Using your CRM, you can provide your customers with targeted, contextual ads that help them make educated buying decisions, and move them through their buyer's journey.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paid Media, Explained in 400 Words or Less</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/earned-owned-paid-media-lead-generation</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/earned-owned-paid-media-lead-generation" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Paid-Media-Examples-Strategy.jpg" alt="Paid-Media-Examples-Strategy" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;An effective content strategy doesn’t rely on only one tactic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;An effective content strategy doesn’t rely on only one tactic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Generating qualified leads requires you to regularly publish&amp;nbsp;compelling, valuable content, explore guest blogging opportunities, identify&amp;nbsp;co-marketing campaigns,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; devise a strategy for promoting said content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, by sponsoring content, you're able to reach audiences that might not have come across you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While content is a fairly general term, it's important to note that there are different types of media that can be leveraged in the process. Knowing the differences between paid and other forms of media -- earned and owned -- is critical to the success of your lead generation efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To help you effectively execute on sponsored content, we'll walk you through different types of media, examples of paid media, and some strategies on how to best leverage them for your company.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Difference Between Earned,&amp;nbsp;Owned, and Paid Media&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Combining earned, owned, and paid media will help you attract, nurture, and close leads, but what do those terms &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; mean? And when it comes to your company's content strategy, how do they fit into the equation?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While all three&amp;nbsp;media efforts are important to your overall goals and should converge in your strategy, there are still distinct differences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Earned Media&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, earned media refers to&amp;nbsp;media exposure you’ve earned through word-of-mouth.&amp;nbsp;Whether it was the&amp;nbsp;fantastic content you've distributed, the influence of your SEO efforts, the customer experience you've delivered, or a combination of all three, earned media refers to the recognition&amp;nbsp;you receive as a result.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can earn media by getting press mentions, positive reviews, reposts, recommendations, etc. You can also facilitate&amp;nbsp;earned media by helping journalists and content writers author their articles, or contributing your own thought leadership content to industry publications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the rise in popularity of social media platforms like Twitter and Quora, it has become easier for content writers&amp;nbsp;and journalists to reach out to your business for quotes and insights to mention in their articles. This&amp;nbsp;type of&amp;nbsp;accreditation&amp;nbsp;helps build trust around your expertise.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At Influence &amp;amp; Co., we earn most of our media through press mentions with our partners and our own guest-contributed content. For example, our co-founder, John Hall, has a regular column on Forbes, where his contributed&amp;nbsp;content helps to drive both traffic and leads for our company.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So whether you're earning mentions on external sites or you've earned an opportunity to contribute to them regularly, this type of media helps to fuel the top of your funnel and introduce you to new leads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Owned Media&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Owned media is content you’re in full control of. Think of content for your company website, your blog, and your social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While owned media content can take on a variety of forms -- blog posts, case studies, whitepapers, etc. -- the primary goal of this content is to continue providing value to leads&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;as they move down the funnel. These assets&amp;nbsp;offer a more controlled -- but not overly promotional -- message about your company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So if&amp;nbsp;you're looking to warm up leads that you've generated with earned media or win over some more, it's important that you're focusing on producing these educational, valuable resources. At the end of the day, this content can help leads&amp;nbsp;determine whether or not working with you&amp;nbsp;is the right choice for them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Paid Media&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While today’s media influx may make it difficult to get your company’s message heard organically, it also brings with it an influx of methods to promote it. Paid media serves as a method for promoting content and driving exposure. And there are&amp;nbsp;variety of paid techniques you can use to amplify your owned media and help you win more earned media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Pinterest offer advertising options that can be leveraged to boost your exposure.&amp;nbsp;We’ve found that LinkedIn and Twitter are the most effective promotion platform for our audience of B2B marketers, but you can utilize a similar strategy on Facebook&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;Pinterest. It all depends on where your target audience is the most active and engaged with your brand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Paid Media Strategy&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I mentioned before, combining these elements can prove to be really powerful in terms of generating and engaging leads. To help illustrate this, let's dive into&amp;nbsp;two examples of content promotion tactics that my company has&amp;nbsp;successfully utilized to amplify our owned media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sponsored Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;LinkedIn: Sponsored Updates&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our marketing team utilizes sponsored updates on LinkedIn to promote our gated content. We set a budget for each campaign; target users based on interest, industry, and job title; and deliver a link to a landing page with a relevant piece of gated content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our reasoning behind promoting gated content via sponsored updates verses our blog content goes back to the idea of delivering the right content to your audience, through the right medium, at the right time. We’ve found that when our audience is on LinkedIn, it’s the perfect time to serve up a piece of gated content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, when looking at the performance of our sponsored posts, we found that the offers that linked straight to a landing page converted at a 500% higher visitors-to-leads conversion rate than sponsored posts that link to blog content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/LinkedIn_Post_Influence_and_Co.png" alt="LinkedIn_Post_Influence_and_Co.png" title="LinkedIn_Post_Influence_and_Co.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Promoted Media&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twitter: Promoted Tweets&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also recently seen success with promoting tweets that have the most engagement. For instance, we promoted&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/InfluenceandCo/status/662282823504674816"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;about our “&lt;a href="https://blog.influenceandco.com/5-unexpected-content-marketing-trends-from-cmis-2016-report"&gt;5 Unexpected Content Marketing Trends from CMI’s 2016 Report&lt;/a&gt;” blog post after we saw that it was garnering a lot of initial engagement. It generated an additional 111 clicks to the post with only $50 in ad spend.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Promoted_Tweets_Influence_and_Co.png" alt="Promoted_Tweets_Influence_and_Co.png" title="Promoted_Tweets_Influence_and_Co.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Promoting tweets is a great way to boost the reach of your most engaging tweets and get them in front of a new audience. To determine whether a tweet is worthy of promotion, we ask ourselves two questions:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did it perform well?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;When a post is performing well organically, it will automatically perform better than your other posts when you sponsor them.&amp;nbsp;Our rule of thumb is to only promote the top 1-3% of tweets that have gotten the most engagement recently.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the content you’re promoting converting well?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;If we’re considering promoting a tweet, we look at the piece of content it references to determine the conversion rate of that piece. If it didn't perform well, we try to pick a new tweet that links to a high-performing piece of content or look at how we can optimize the blog post for better conversion before putting dollars behind promoting it on social media.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Paid Media Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of paid media avenues on Facebook. First, you can experiment with paid targeted advertising that shows up on users' news feeds. These are often single space ads. Alternatively, you can buy carousel ads: these are a swipeable series of images in a single ad space, allowing advertisers to tell a better story and showcase more products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook%20Ad%20Example.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;name=Facebook%20Ad%20Example.jpg" alt="Facebook Ad Example" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image Courtesy of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/714656935225188"&gt;Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Besides the homepage, there are many &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/407108559393196#"&gt;different options for ad placements&lt;/a&gt;, like Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Suggested Video, Facebook Right Column, and Messenger Inbox.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Facebook ads are often incredibly tailored to your marketing goals: you start by setting your objective, choosing your ideal audience, deciding where to place your ads, and setting a budget, and so on to increase the likelihood of attracting your target market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Much like Facebook, LinkedIn offers sponsored content &lt;a href="#LinkedIn-Sponsored-Updates"&gt;or updates&lt;/a&gt; in and around users' feeds across devices. They also offer &lt;a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ads"&gt;Sponsored InMail&lt;/a&gt;, where advertisers can deliver content to target audiences through their Messaging feature. The sponsored messages only deliver when the user is live on LinkedIn, meaning that the paid message will pop up in her chat box at the bottom of the screen, drawing her attention to the offering and increasing your chances of being noticed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Twitter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple &lt;a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/solutions/twitter-ads.html"&gt;Twitter ad campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, each designed to solve a specific problem: increasing brand awareness or engagement, growing your follower count, incentivizing website clicks, increasing app installs, or quickly promoting a new offer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After setting your ads objective, advertisers then choose the audiences to target, bid on the cost per interaction, and select which tweets to sponsor. Promoted Tweets are paid, placed ads on users' Twitter feeds, search results page, promoted trends, or through official Twitter advertising partners. (We walked through this strategy in greater depth &lt;a href="#Promoted-Tweets"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;YouTube&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Youtube is a versatile platform when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/features/youtube-playbook/topic/paid-promotion/"&gt;its paid media&lt;/a&gt; -- it can be anything from bumper ads (six second ads), Google Preferred (non-skippable, mid-length ads), TrueView InStream (skippable, long format ads), or TrueView Action (video format with a CTA). Alternatively, you might consider partnering with content creators on YouTube to promote your brand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/YouTube%20Ad%20Example.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=YouTube%20Ad%20Example.png" alt="YouTube Ad Example" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image Courtesy of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/ads/how-it-works/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;PPC&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pay-Per-Click -- or &lt;a href="/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.34345507.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;PPC&lt;/a&gt; -- is a paid search results strategy that charges advertisers for each click a promoted result receives. These paid search ads are the first few hits on a keyword's search results page and are marked with a green "Ad" label. Since most search engine users don't tend to look beyond the first few hits -- let alone beyond the first results page -- they can be an effective way to boost awareness and drive traffic to your site.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PPC%20Example.png?width=528&amp;amp;name=PPC%20Example.png" alt="PPC Example" width="528" style="width: 528px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Display Ads&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This type of paid media is likely the most recognized, as pop-ups, wallpaper ads, banners, and video ads can be found on almost every web page on the internet. They are usually pretty affordable on a cost-per-click basis and are an excellent way to increase brand awareness and recognition. The problem with display ads is that because they are so prolific, users tend to ignore them or even block them entirely.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;img src="https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fearned-owned-paid-media-lead-generation&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" style="min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; "&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Ultimate Guide to Integrations and Why Your Business Needs Them</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/integrations</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/integrations" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/integrations-2.jpg" alt="integrations-2" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself working on a project in which you had to toggle between multiple software and applications? Perhaps you had to plug data from one system into another or rewrite the same content over and over again to ensure it was in multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although few people have the time or patience for this type of tedious work, it’s highly common and often critical to your business’s success — these mundane tasks need to get done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself working on a project in which you had to toggle between multiple software and applications? Perhaps you had to plug data from one system into another or rewrite the same content over and over again to ensure it was in multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although few people have the time or patience for this type of tedious work, it’s highly common and often critical to your business’s success — these mundane tasks need to get done.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What if there was a way to connect your software to the applications you use in a way that successfully brings them together? This would mean all of your information and data would live in a central location with no manual entry required, even if those applications don’t actually come with the software itself … sound nice?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Well, good news! This type of solution exists … it’s called an &lt;strong&gt;integration&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Integrations are a complex topic to understand. So, let’s simplify the concept with the help of an analogy we can reference throughout this guide. Let’s pretend you want to plug your MacBook laptop into your TV using a connector cable so you can watch reruns of Friends on Netflix on the big screen. And integration kind of works like this — I’ll explain more as we go.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://docs.google.com/a/hubspot.com/drawings/d/svOKAAijuEee1UcTkqY-knQ/image?parent=1xU9AVbjLRDDV78t5W6AdknVJodSYBCEmypuNSfrElCk&amp;amp;rev=68&amp;amp;h=110&amp;amp;w=616&amp;amp;ac=1" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="application-integrations-example"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Back to our analogy: If your &lt;strong&gt;software&lt;/strong&gt; is your laptop, you’ll use a connector cable, or &lt;strong&gt;integration&lt;/strong&gt;, to then watch Friends on the TV, or &lt;strong&gt;application&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://docs.google.com/a/hubspot.com/drawings/d/srHPCIh1I_ca6aV951yxUfQ/image?parent=1xU9AVbjLRDDV78t5W6AdknVJodSYBCEmypuNSfrElCk&amp;amp;rev=132&amp;amp;h=125&amp;amp;w=624&amp;amp;ac=1" alt="example-of-integration" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s run through some commonly asked questions about integrations to help you get a better grasp on what they are, how they work, and why your company needs them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Why use integrations?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Integrations solve and simplify your need for new software as your business grows and evolves. They allow you to keep the system you’re currently using by simply adding connections to third-party applications to enhance system functionality and provide additional features you may need but aren’t able to build within your software. You can keep your current laptop and TV, and simply use the connector cable to watch Friends on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging integration connections across your systems, you can power your business to achieve a much wider range of tasks on your software as you enhance its functionality. This is especially helpful as your business expands since your needs are bound to change.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although your software may have the functionality you need when you start your business, you’re likely going to want additional applications to provide the features you end up needing later on, as you grow.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of integrations, each of which have specific functions to help meet different needs. The easiest way to think about the various types of integrations is by category. Some integrations have several functions, meaning they could technically fit into many categories because they serve more than one main purpose. Other integrations have one specific function.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Who needs integrations?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Integrations are helpful tools for virtually every business, no matter the size or industry. There are integrations suited for every type of company (startups, SMBs, and enterprise companies) with any purpose (advertising, analytics, or content).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you sell software, as &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.197914799.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;we do at HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find yourself not only using connections for your internal software but also for your customers to use along with your software. This is because your software may not have every feature and function your customers need to run their business. So, by adding an integration, they’ll get that added feature or function while continuing to use your software.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Referring back to our analogy, without the integration, or connector cable, your laptop wouldn’t be able to communicate with your TV to allow you to watch Friends on the big screen. You need that integration, or cable, to allow for added functionality and watch the show on TV — without it, this wouldn’t be possible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How do you get integrations?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Integrations are almost always located in some type of marketplace, where customers can review and browse all of their options. The &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations"&gt;Hu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations?_ga=2.197914799.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;bSpot Integrations &amp;amp; Application Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; is an example of this. Our marketplace allows visitors to search and learn more about the various integrations and their functions, and then connect HubSpot to their integration of choice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(No, you can’t go to Best Buy to pick up your integration as you would with your connector cable to watch Friends on your TV… you’re right, the example doesn’t quite work here.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How do integrations work with APIs?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;API stands for &lt;a href="/blog/tabid/6307/bid/8341/a-marketer-s-guide-to-apis.aspx?_ga=2.197914799.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;application programming interface&lt;/a&gt;. An API is an interface that software uses to receive information (whether that’s data, servers, applications, etc.).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All of the integrations we’re going to discuss below are built on APIs. By building integrations on APIs, you can connect your integrations to your software and use them in tandem with one another. The integration allows for the flow of information to and from apps and devices in real time — APIs allow them to talk to one another.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about this in terms of our analogy from above: The application is the TV, the programming allows your laptop to communicate with the TV, and the interface is how you (the user) are able to interact with the application (by watching Friends on your TV). In this example, the API is the port on the side of your laptop in which you actually insert your integration (the cable) to then connect your laptop to your TV.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Integration vs. iPaaS Solution&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard of integrations before, chances are you’ve also heard about &lt;a href="/marketing/ipaas-guide?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;iPaaS, or Integration Platform as a Service&lt;/a&gt;. The difference between the two is an important distinction to make when determining which one you need for your business. While an integration is a one-to-one, direct connection solution, an iPaaS solution is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead, iPaaS is a cloud-based platform that connects your applications and systems — whether that’s in the cloud or on-premise — between an organization and third-party software &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the use of middleware.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, if you look for an integration solution on your software’s marketplace and don’t find the connection you’re looking for, then you’d turn to an iPaaS solution to solve your need for that connection. There are a few integrations available today (called “connector integrations”, which we’ll cover an example of below) that can help you build custom integrations..&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, which integrations should you actually use? Let’s look at a list of some of the most popular integrations available.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Popular Integrations&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following integrations are categorized by business need to help you browse through your options. (Almost all of these integrations fit into multiple categories, as they have functions that allow them to do multiple things. Below, we placed them in the category they’re best suited for.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note these are just &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of today’s popular integrations — there are hundreds of more integrations to learn about and choose from as your business grows. The list we’ve compiled below is of integrations that connect with &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t to say these &lt;a href="/marketing/hubspot-platform-update-q1-2019"&gt;HubSpot integrations&lt;/a&gt; don’t also work with other software. In fact, most of these integrations &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; compatible with dozens of programs in addition to HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Advertising Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Advertising integrations help you market to and reach your target audience. Data about the success of your ads and/ or the leads obtained from them is automatically added to your &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;HubSpot CRM&lt;/a&gt; so you can learn more about the people who interact with your ads and nurture them into customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/facebookads?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Facebook Ads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook Ads integration allows you to connect your &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads"&gt;Facebook Ads account&lt;/a&gt; to HubSpot. This integration gives you the ability to attribute your ads directly to the contacts who interact with them. It also allows you to review real data about which ads impact your bottom line. This simplifies the reporting process for all of your Facebook Ad efforts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/adroll?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;AdRoll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Different businesses and products have various buyer personas. The AdRoll integration gives you the opportunity to create personalized retargeting ads for different lead segments in your HubSpot contacts. You can personalize several parts of the ads, such as content and formatting, that will best relate to your prospect. This allows you to focus on your audience’s attributes so you can effectively reach your prospects — you can gather intricate details about your prospects from your CRM via the integration so you’re able to successfully retarget them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/instapage?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Instapag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/instapage"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a developer, creating your website’s landing page might sound like an overwhelming task. The Instapage integration provides a straightforward option for anyone who wants to create and personalize their landing page and then send lead information straight to HubSpot. These details are automatically placed under the associated contact in HubSpot for you— meaning, there’s no need to perform this transfer manually.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ABM Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ABM stands for account-based marketing. These integrations help you leverage your account and audience data so you can tailor your messaging, CTAs, and marketing strategies to close deals and attract customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/orgcharthub?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;OrgChartHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The OrgChartHub integration allows you to efficiently build customer organization charts without ever leaving HubSpot. You can create customer organization charts while in HubSpot so you’re able to easily identify unknown contacts, visualize key stakeholders, and customize your sales personas without manually sending any of this information back and forth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/calibermind?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;CaliberMind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the CaliberMind integration, you’ll be able to look at your cross-channel account engagement and create alerts for your reps about which deals they should focus on closing to meet quota. The integration takes your contacts directly from HubSpot and automatically matches them to their associated accounts so you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/metadata?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Metadata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Metadata integration provides account-based advertising services. You can automatically identify specific target accounts and contacts from HubSpot to create personalized advertisements at scale to help you close more deals and reach your target audience more effectively.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Analytics and Data Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These integrations help you measure your success across a number of analytics platforms. You can look at your data in different ways and ensure all of this information is well-organized in HubSpot so your team can review it at any time. These integrations help you learn more about which of your efforts are working and which ones need to be modified.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/databox?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Databox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the increase of remote employees across businesses and the number of people who access their work while on-the-go, having the ability to review and manage your key performance indicators (KPIs) from anywhere can be quite helpful. The Databox integration provides you with access to all of your analytics data in HubSpot from a wide variety of sources including Google Analytics, SEMRush, mobile, desktop, Facebook, and more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/hotjar?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Hotjar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In a world where many website visitors are uninterested in completing forms and providing their personal information, Hotjar is a great way to learn about who your visitors are and what they’re looking for on your site. The Hotjar integration gives you insight into who your website and mobile visitors are and what their needs consist of directly from HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/klipfolio?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Klipfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Klipfolio integration shows you your most important metrics in real-time and creates easy-to-read dashboards in HubSpot so you can track and analyze performance across all of your platforms from one location. This allows you to improve your data transparency and reach your targets faster.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Calling Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a meeting with fellow employees or your prospective and current customers, calling integrations will make all phone and video call interactions simple. Your contact’s information and details about the call will be recorded in HubSpot for easy access. This also provides sales reps and support team members with the necessary background information to assist the prospect or customer appropriately.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/uberconference?_ga=2.203029905.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;UberConference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With UberConference, it takes just seconds to schedule your meetings with colleagues and prospective customers so you can focus on tasks that require more attention. The integration allows you to schedule meetings quickly and easily without ever having to leave your HubSpot portal.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/aircall?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Aircall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Phone calls remain one of the most effective ways to interact with your prospective and current customers.

&lt;h3&gt;Connector Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Connector integrations provide you with access to dozens of applications which sync to HubSpot to save you time and add functionality. Some connector integrations offer a wide range of applications and some have more specific types of applications. Additionally, some connector integrations can assist in creating a custom integration to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/automateio?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Automate.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Automate.io integration connects to HubSpot to give you access to over 80 applications.

&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/zapier?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Zapier integration allows you to automatically connect your software to over 1,000 applications. It links your apps to HubSpot for you in just a few clicks to save you time. There’s no coding required and your apps will be able to begin sharing data in an easy-to-read workflow format in your HubSpot portal.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/piesync?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;PieSync&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The PieSync integration provides real-time, two-way contact sync. This means every time you add a contact to HubSpot, it automatically syncs to an application (such as Google Contacts or Outlook), and vice versa — you don’t need to worry about any importing or exporting, expediting and simplifying your contact syncs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Content Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Content integrations help you create, design, and share custom content for your website. They also help you learn about &lt;em&gt;who’s&lt;/em&gt; interacting with the content and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they’re interacting with it. That information is then synced to HubSpot so you can organize it and add it to specific contacts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/beacon?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your website has a collection of blog posts, the Beacon integration might be a good option for you. The integration ensures your content looks professional and allows you to drive more leads by getting more value out of your existing content — it connects to HubSpot to automatically convert your blog posts into downloadable content such as eBooks.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/brix?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;briX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The briX integration connects to HubSpot so you can design and personalize web pages for your site. You don’t need a background in web design or coding to create beautiful pages — the drag-and-drop template and 100+ customizable features make it easy to organize your content in any way you choose.

&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/belchio?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Belch.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Customized landing pages, web pages, and emails provide a professional look and feel for your visitors, leads, and customers while interacting with your business online. The Belch.io integration connects to HubSpot so you can personalize and brand all of these things in just minutes. It’s a great option for anyone without a background in coding or web development who wants to design and customize their site pages and emails to complement their brand all from HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Customer Success Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Customer success integrations connect to HubSpot to make your internal and external interactions with employees (cross-team) and customers straightforward. They simplify communication and help you share information and/or data when you need to.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/slack?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Slack integration is a digital workspace and communication tool that allows you to connect and talk with your team members. The integration is ideal for team collaboration and coordination from anywhere. By connecting the integration to your software, you can use Slack’s and HubSpot’s features in either the application &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the software so you don’t have to waste time toggling back and forth — the same information will be found in both locations in real time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/zendesk?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Zendesk offers a ticketing system to keep track of customer inquiries and allows you to keep details about all of your customer interactions in one place. It helps you provide consistent customer experiences among your fellow employees and customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By connecting HubSpot to the Zendesk integration, you’ll be able to bring the work of your sales, marketing, and support teams together in a central location. It also allows these departments to communicate with each other while in HubSpot as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/livechat?_ga=2.227161245.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;LiveChat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The LiveChat integration allows you to communicate with potential customers in real-time when they need assistance or guidance while on your website from HubSpot. Whether it’s a question about your product or the need for help in the checkout process, LiveChat allows you to walk them through the information they need to help you boost conversions and build strong relationships with prospects and customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Ecommerce Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have an online store, ecommerce integrations are a great way to learn about what your customers and visitors are doing while they’re on your website. By connecting these integrations to HubSpot, you’ll know when your visitors are most frequently abandoning your site or their carts so you can create re-engagement content to regain their interest.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/shopify?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Shopify integration allows you to easily incorporate all of your ecommerce data and customer data within HubSpot. It automatically syncs customer, product, and deal information in HubSpot under the associated customer’s profile, so your entire team can view all of these details in one location. You can also create cart abandonment nurturing tactics, re-engagement ads for your website from HubSpot once you connect the integration to the software.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/typeform?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Typeform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Typeform integration helps you create and design web and mobile forms for your leads. You can create contact forms, sign up forms, quizzes, and more, and all of your responses will automatically be sent directly to HubSpot so you can easily review your results and responses and compile them under the associated contact in HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/magento-by-eyemagine?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Magento&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Magento integration helps you create and send upsell, cross-sell, and reorder emails as well as develop abandoned cart nurturing tactics to boost your conversions. It automatically sends all of your customers’ ecommerce-related data, as well as emails between you and your customers, straight to their respective HubSpot contact record.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Email Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Email integrations help you track a prospect’s interactions with sales reps, personalize your email automation with certain contacts, and measure the success of your email campaigns among your target audience — all from HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/mailchimp?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The MailChimp integration allows you to sync HubSpot with your email service provider. You can build email campaigns and rest easy knowing the Intelligent Error Handling feature will continue engaging your contacts even if a syncing error occurs between the software and application. By connecting MailChimp to HubSpot, you’ll have the ability to automatically add contacts from HubSpot into your application’s email lists and vice versa so you never have to do it manually.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/privy?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Privy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

The integration uses targeted pop-up ads, banners, bars, and more to help you boost conversions and decrease page abandonment. It also automatically syncs all of your new leads from your website to HubSpot so the software can help you nurture them and convert them into customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/front?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Front&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Front integration is a collaborative inbox, meaning all members of your team can see and access your contacts, review deals, and see all activity history while working in HubSpot. All of these details are automatically synced in Front &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your CRM. This helps you improve your customer experience and ensure it remains consistent no matter which employees your customers work with.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Event and Webinar Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s an in-person event, a webinar, an online meeting, or a video conference, the following integrations simplify every aspect of hosting an event. They allow your contacts to book meetings with you and you can update all information related to your contacts post-event or meeting in HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/eventbrite?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter the type of event you’re hosting, the GoToWebinar integration automatically syncs all of your registrant and participant information in HubSpot under the associated contact. You’ll never have to worry about manually importing data about your webinar contacts again — instead, you’ll have more time to focus on the event itself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/setmore?_ga=2.227679389.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Setmore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/wordpress?_ga=2.260324493.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once connected to HubSpot, you’ll automatically be notified of any action a prospect takes on any document you send them with the HelloSign integration. Examples of the actions you’ll be notified about include when a prospect or customer receives, opens, or signs the document. Then, this activity data is sent to the contact it belongs to in HubSpot so reps know where the prospect or customer is in the buyer’s journey and how they should go about following up with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/salesforce?_ga=2.261306765.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

This allows you to work with reps to get strong lead intelligence and revenue reporting. You can mesh your marketing and sales work, content, and information so you and your team can access any information from either system at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/pandadoc"&gt;PandaDoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sales work, there are many tasks involved that don’t necessarily include the process of actually closing a deal. The PandaDoc integration automatically organizes and reviews information from HubSpot about your prospect to help you with non-selling tasks like creating and sending quotes, proposals, and contracts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Understanding your &lt;a href="/marketing/social-media-marketing?_ga=2.261306765.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;social media following is a huge part of successful marketing&lt;/a&gt;. Social media integrations help you learn about your followers, understand the type of content they interact with and share, and automate specific parts of your social media strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/facebook?_ga=2.261306765.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/linkedin?_ga=2.261306765.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Video Integrations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of video and &lt;a href="/marketing/video-marketing?_ga=2.261306765.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;video marketing&lt;/a&gt; in business today, integrations that help you incorporate this media on your website have become quite useful. They allow you to create and implement videos on your site pages and forms as well as measure the success of your video marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/wistia?_ga=2.261306765.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;Wistia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Wistia integration provides you with the ability to integrate videos on your website, and then incorporate HubSpot forms with those videos to improve video engagement (and hopefully, conversion) rates. If any lead converts on a video, their information is automatically sent to HubSpot so you’ll have their video-viewing data paired with their contact details.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/youtube?_ga=2.30498111.1611654906.1563289844-1493293515.1553017609"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The YouTube integration connects your YouTube channel to HubSpot. This way, you can easily report on your video and channel success and compare this data to that of your other social platforms using HubSpot’s analytics and social media tools and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Promo integration, you can choose from over three million clips, templates, and music options to use to create a video for your site directly from HubSpot. You can easily throw in custom messaging, branding, or logos to personalize the video for your business based on a specific prospect’s needs and interests, found under their specific contact in HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEO vs. PPC: When to Optimize and When to Pay for Traffic</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tabid/6307/bid/1514/paid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tabid/6307/bid/1514/paid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/seo-vs-ppc.jpg" alt="seo-vs-ppc" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have an amazing new product -- you've created a software that recommends the perfect pizza toppings for your personality, and you're excited to share your business with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have an amazing new product -- you've created a software that recommends the perfect pizza toppings for your personality, and you're excited to share your business with the world.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you have no idea how to share this revolutionary product with as many of your target users as possible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many small businesses are faced with a similar problem of getting found by the right audience -- it doesn't matter how accurate your pizza bot is in determining whether or not you like pineapple on your pizza if users can't find you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are two popular search strategies by which organizations solve this problem -- Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Pay-Per-Click (PPC). But which method is right for you and your pizza software company? Is it better to pursue an organic-first approach and find consumers through search engine rankings, or is it better to invest in an advertisement at the top of a keyword results page?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, we've explored what each of these two acquisition strategies do and provided some descriptive statistics to help you decide whether you're business is best suited for SEO or PPC -- or both.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;What is SEO?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Just as you turn to your favorite search engine to look up a new marketing acronym or where to get good pizza, so do your consumers. By investing in SEO, or &lt;a href="/marketing/seo?_ga=2.101314819.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;search engine optimization&lt;/a&gt;, you're increasing the likelihood of your target audience finding you when they search for things related to your product or service.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's important to build a Google presence if you want your organization to succeed, and by increasing your rank among search results you're improving your online visibility and domain authority. In other words, by building up the content on your site, optimizing for keywords on which to rank, publishing your NAP (name, address, and phone number), and more, Google is &lt;a href="/marketing/seo?_ga=2.141628786.1559363486.1561986372-527251855.1560789477"&gt;more likely to think your site is relevant&lt;/a&gt; and push your link higher up on a keyword's search results page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SEO%20example.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=SEO%20example.png" alt="SEO example" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;What is PPC?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PPC, or &lt;a href="/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.101314819.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;pay-per-click&lt;/a&gt;, is a form of search engine marketing (SEM) where an advertiser pays a publisher (such as Google or Facebook) every time the ad is clicked. This model allows advertisers to only pay when consumers interact with their listing -- meaning you attract people who are interested in your offer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This method is mostly associated with search engines as advertisers bid on search keywords relevant to their target markets. You may have noticed that the top search results are tagged with an "Ad" marker. The higher the keyword search volume, the more advertisers need to pay.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If an organization does not have the domain authority to get their website ranking on search engines organically, PPC can help businesses stay competitive in a crowded market and quickly get in front of their target consumers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PPC%20example%20.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=PPC%20example%20.png" alt="PPC example " width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;SEO vs PPC Statistics&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;PPC&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The top 3 paid advertising spots get &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powertraffick.com/ppc-trends-and-statistics"&gt;46% of the clicks on the page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;According to Power Traffick, the top three links on a search engine results page (SERP) capture almost half of all traffic for that keyword. This data supports the PPC method as it involves buying ad space at the top of the SERP.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Businesses make, on average, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powertraffick.com/ppc-trends-and-statistics"&gt;$3 in revenue for every $1.60 they spend &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on AdWords. &lt;/strong&gt;PPC is a relatively inexpensive way to experiment, and there is a solid average ROI for investing in paid search ads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. More than &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2017/adblockreport/"&gt;615 million devices use Adblock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;As a consumer, Adblock is amazing: it stops all those eerily targeted ads from popping up on your Facebook feed. However, as a marketer, it can be frustrating to invest in PPC if huge numbers of your target consumers will never see your ad. Additionally, this number is growing quickly: ad blocking has &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.133438988.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;grown 15-30%&lt;/a&gt; in the last four years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. PPC Ads can &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cleverclicks.com.au/blog/best-ppc-stats-trends-2018/"&gt;boost awareness by 80%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; In spite of ad blockers, PPC is still effective in increasing your brand's reach and awareness.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Google's algorithm updates don't affect PPC.&lt;/strong&gt; While not a stat per se, a big benefit of PPC is that it's immune to Google's changing SERP ranking algorithm. In 2018, Google reported that they had updated their algorithm &lt;a href="https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change"&gt;3,234 times&lt;/a&gt;! If you're using the SEO method, you have to adjust your content optimization to rank better according to the updated algorithm requirements.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.133438988.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;63% of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; reported that they would click on a Google ad. &lt;/strong&gt;A high CTR is the goal driving both PPC and SEO, and if the majority of surveyed consumers report that they would click into a paid search ad, it is a compelling statistic for investing in PPC.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://clutch.co/seo-firms/resources/search-engine-marketing-why-people-click-paid-search-ads"&gt;75% say it's easier to find &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what they're looking for from paid ads. &lt;/strong&gt;The reason the first page of search results -- especially the few few hits -- get the vast majority of clicks is due to the combination of ease of use and finding what the searcher is looking for. Bidding on target keywords through PPC accomplishes both of these needs: the paid ads are easy to find at the top of the SERP and they answer the question of the searcher.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;SEO&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Nearly &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.133438988.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;80% of users ignore paid ads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in search results. &lt;/strong&gt;People tend to prefer organic links more than paid ones, and of the links search users click, about &lt;a href="https://www.imforza.com/blog/8-seo-stats-that-are-hard-to-ignore/"&gt;70% are organic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Search is the #1 driver of traffic to content sites, beating social media &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imforza.com/blog/8-seo-stats-that-are-hard-to-ignore/"&gt;by more than 300%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Organic search is one of the most effective marketing channels, often being a consumer's first point of contact with an organization.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. SEO drives &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/richardachavez/segmenting-the-customer-journey-via-search"&gt;30% of traffic, and 20% of revenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;SEO ROI accumulates over time as content creators establish authority and visibility. Prospects often visit a website more than once before filling out a form or making a purchase, so ranking higher for more keywords increases the likelihood of conversions over time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0026/80828/2016-adults-media-use-and-attitudes.pdf"&gt;36.2% of consumers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;recognize links that are paid advertisements, but don't click on them. &lt;/strong&gt;Many search users aren't able to differentiate between paid ads and organic links -- in fact, only half of searchers correctly identify ads. In spite of this, consumers are still preferring the organic links over the PPC ones.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/local-seo-stats?_ga=2.133438988.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;88% of searches&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;for local businesses on a mobile device either call or visit the business within 24 hours. &lt;/strong&gt;Local SEO has excellent SEO -- the number of local searches are increasing by 900% in two years, and by optimizing content and web pages for nearby audiences, organizations can see remarkable growth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.265035277.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;One in ten blog posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; are compounding.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that organic search increases their traffic over time, and as the number of visitors aggregates, so does the number of conversions. Historical content is a critical part of both SEO and customer acquisition strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Organic SEO is about&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.265035277.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;5.66 times better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;than paid search ads. &lt;/strong&gt;HubSpot's co-founder, Brian Halligan, ardently believes in an organic-first strategy for its longevity and strong conversion performance. According to HubSpot's&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing?_ga=2.265035277.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt; inbound marketing philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, paid outbound marketing interrupts audiences with outreach they don't want, whereas organic optimization draws in consumers with content they love.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, whichever strategy you choose will depend on your business's needs, budget, and mission. Oftentimes, organizations will invest in both to see which strategy will help them grow better.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 of the Best SEO Link Building Software Solutions in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-software" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/link-building-software.jpg" alt="link-building-software" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;All search engine algorithms are driven at least in part by links, which makes &lt;a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/link-building-tutorial?_ga=2.74976210.1184505237.1563200671-1451183703.1557949920"&gt;link building an essential aspect of SEO&lt;/a&gt;.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;All search engine algorithms are driven at least in part by links, which makes &lt;a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/link-building-tutorial?_ga=2.74976210.1184505237.1563200671-1451183703.1557949920"&gt;link building an essential aspect of SEO&lt;/a&gt;. It's also a cost-effective marketing principle that, when done right, allows you to essentially advertise on other reputable websites for free, while gaining high-quality referral traffic.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The term "link building" refers to the process of creating links on other websites to increase search engine rankings and drive referral traffic back to your site. You can embed links to your site within various forms of content -- including, but not limited to, blog posts, infographics, articles, press releases, and images.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Link building is one of the most important SEO practices today, and using the best link building software is essential to getting it right.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, we're going to explore six of the best SEO link building software solutions. But first, let's dive into the importance of link building.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Important Role Links Play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're a marketer, you want to increase your business's online presence, but that's nearly impossible to do without a fair number of quality inbound links pointing to your site. Online, links are the infrastructure that people rely on to reach you. Ignoring them is like building a brick-and-mortar store without any roads leading to it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In a 2017 survey of online marketers, nearly three-quarters of respondents said they believe that &lt;a href="https://www.link-assistant.com/news/link-building-survey-2017.html"&gt;link building is a critical SEO factor&lt;/a&gt;. It helps establish you as an authority in your area of expertise by connecting your website to highly reputable and credible sites in the same niche.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you build your brand with quality backlinks from credible sites, Google will trust your content more and, eventually, you'll see your website's organic rankings increase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, links enable you to build brand recognition, and increase trust among your clients. By link building with high-quality sites, you also generate higher-quality leads that are more likely to follow the path to becoming loyal clients.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, not all link building is created equal. I preach white hat link building, and we transparently &lt;a href="https://www.teknicks.com/services/seo/link-building/"&gt;showcase our link building process&lt;/a&gt; on our site. We believe that if you create useful content, websites will gladly link to you -- and our methodology supports that.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The success of your link building campaign will naturally boost your brand's relationship with other brands and their websites. Customers can more easily connect with other great products and services, and your network of links will boost your website's value in the eyes of the search engines that crawl, index, and rank it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link Building Best Practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The bare-bones definition of link building is strategically acquiring links pointing back to your website to increase organic rankings and potentially drive referral traffic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;successful&lt;/em&gt; link building is more than that -- it also means carefully considering where you place your links, the type and format of the links, the links' anchor text, and how diversified the backlink portfolio is.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I've found these best practices to be effective parts of an overall link building strategy:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create awesome content:&lt;/strong&gt; While there are several best practices you should follow, it all starts with surrounding your links with stellar content. High-quality content is the most important part of the value you can bring to online users. The more valuable and engaging your content is, the more likely you can earn coveted spots on popular websites. That includes making your content easy to read but full of valuable information like stats, quotes, and other trustworthy data.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep links relevant:&lt;/strong&gt; The links should also lead back to high-quality and relevant information on your site. Search engines emphasize relevance, which is another reason it's important to target websites within your industry. For example, if your site offers professional cleaning services, linking to a site offering cleaning equipment would be more relevant than linking to a sports equipment company.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less is more:&lt;/strong&gt; As you aim for quality, you'll realize that placing a few links on high-quality sites is much more effective than placing a larger number of links on suspicious or spammy sites. For instance, with the right social media management tools, you can make the most of your link building software on &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;the most visible online platforms&lt;/a&gt;. It's all about quality over quantity. I also recommend diversifying your link portfolio to have a mix of different kinds of links.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; Popular blogs are quickly becoming the place we go for reliable, relevant news for just about any industry. Take advantage of the existing audiences on blogs in your industry by commenting on posts or even guest blogging if you can. Blog comment links won't pass any clout, but it will grab the author's attention. If you are adding value, that will make it easier to partner up on content opportunities. Similarly, developing strong ties with industry influencers and reputable authors can help you add to your arsenal of well-placed links.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for resource pages:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the more proven link building strategies is to get links included on a popular resource page. Websites often list helpful links and resources for specific topics, such as a recipe page on a food blog centered on a particular restaurant. If you have a recipe or related content to share, you can reach out to the website's author to ask if he or she could include your links on the page. If it's a good fit for the page and your brand, it can turn into a home run.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEO Link Building Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While there are many different ways to execute a successful link building strategy, one constant is the need for the right software for SEO link building to accomplish your goals. There are several to choose from, though -- so how do you know which one is best?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry. Here, we've compiled some of the best SEO link building software programs in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>500+ Journalists Agree: These Are the Worst PR Tactics in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/worst-pr-tactics</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/worst-pr-tactics" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/journalist-pr-tactics.jpg" alt="journalist-pr-tactics" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Spend any amount of time searching the hashtag #PRFail on Twitter and you won't struggle to find journalists lamenting about all of the bad PR pitches they received this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spend any amount of time searching the hashtag #PRFail on Twitter and you won't struggle to find journalists lamenting about all of the bad PR pitches they received this week.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between journalists and PR professionals is complicated. While PR professionals need the media in order for their job to function, it's also true that to some degree, journalists rely on PR professionals to deliver newsworthy story ideas directly to their inboxes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even though there are some #PRFail horror stories with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicole/status/1108835195833049088"&gt;shockingly bad&lt;/a&gt; tactics, these instances are still the minority.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;PR pros usually teeter on a fine line between professionally offering content of value to a journalist -- and rubbing them the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since PR professionals rely so heavily on their relationships with media contacts, it's important to be &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/public-relations"&gt;professional in communication efforts&lt;/a&gt; and not bite the hand that feeds you, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My team at Fractl has been earning top-tier coverage in the media for our clients for over six years, and we have always been interested in learning how to establish real, trusting relationships with media contacts to better serve our clients.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to uncover what methods of communication really irks journalists, &lt;a href="https://www.frac.tl/work/marketing-research/pitching-pet-peeves/"&gt;we surveyed 500+ journalists, editors, and freelance contributors&lt;/a&gt; to learn the most offensive email pitch pet peeves in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into those, now.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalists' Top Ten Email Pitch Pet Peeves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KDj4cJCkG6y3fA_WMFB2ojmfd8IdvPCycco6n7KSpCYSEi1tFymWpo_34g0KZcQjL-ih-qvK0ajW7raiJXTFQNbWtWUEfTm2vUjMCJUBNAdh5cNILs4Y1j86YznfzT-UF5Xq7VkCnGR6vJbnkg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Receiving an irrelevant pitch.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The most offensive PR practice as reported by over 500 journalists -- by far -- is receiving a pitch that is irrelevant to the writers' beat.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A message to all PR practitioners:&lt;em&gt; stop doing this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Receiving an irrelevant pitch is easily the number one complaint from journalists. If a writer covers sustainable beauty, don't pitch them about your sustainable fashion clients. There's a better writer you could target.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a writer covers personal finance, don't pitch them your bitcoin related content unless their author archives suggest it's highly relevant to something they've expressed interest in before.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do your research, and then do it again. You might be certain that content you're offering is relevant to a certain publication, but check to make sure. For example, Bustle.com covers all sorts of women's interest topics. At first glance, you might think it's a good fit to pitch a piece of content detailing female millennials favorite trendy diets. But you'd be wrong. This publisher is adamant about &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; covering anything related to diets or body shaming.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Research pays off.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WghyW3xHNUeMysahJplCeT8ZLWSQggxhtMNsF5ABFfWDTwEJeiUlFCoonekl6ivr_SyYUVbju2HsRQed75pBMrPvn6t-rzKxLc6mnpgHjYbGfdmpurj-uoSSsZJVRoAL-kK8XdY1xbzG59OoYA" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaitlinKellyNYC/status/1138432165618900995"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Receiving too many follow-ups.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How many follow-ups becomes too many follow-ups? When is it okay to send a follow-up email? What should you &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/sales/sales-follow-up-email"&gt;include in a follow-up email&lt;/a&gt;? We asked journalists these questions and we found that online writers, editors, and freelance contributors prefer zero or one follow-up emails -- and want to receive it an average of three to seven days after you've sent your initial pitch.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CfBwCGIhypr4zdxqoO0ZX0RQbiVA_d-6i1oB86R2By635z9Psqm43jsYKlYc4KeM9L6W2UtnyymSLzTuth-mHqKGcSeOuQzQCX16HD8ipgR7NFrbsrh7V_Na9SIN2MhrT9VlhywsZrBOESX2gQ" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LGQmP6Om0Pj9MHbC2buwrTk_-Nbme4olp6zszN6pHJYP0XYcN__jb2YXqGENEgfGJTDfV2JIH_cOgttntLSAuaF7hsJ4e8R7ieimCPqc3Urp8LGPneZdtrduq68eSJtf-kIn5jbgAi8hOBW1bA" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshsternberg/status/1131920061806108673"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Receiving a pitch that is too self promotional without a real story.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, one bad PR practice to avoid is pitching a journalist a "story" when in reality you're just hoping they'll cover your client without offering anything to them that could be considered newsworthy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, journalists aren't interested in quoting someone in your organization without any context -- nor do they want to write about new products or company updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's important to make sure you're offering something of value to writers and editors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Create compelling, newsworthy content that would appeal to their readership, and tie it back to your client's goal or mission. Then, once you have a relevant pitch, reach out.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One popular content marketing format is using data to tell a story. Delve into an existing data set, run a survey (like we did in this article), or analyze trends in order to speak out about a common issue within your niche. Bring something truly interesting to the table and journalists will be that much more likely to cover your content (and your client).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice from Top Tier Journalists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We asked hundreds of journalists from top online publishers like TIME, CNN, The New York Times, Bustle and more the following question: &lt;em&gt;“If you could give 1-3 points of feedback to the people pitching you, what would you say?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Read their industry advice and feedback in the flipbook, below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style="max-width: 800; display: table; margin: 0px auto;" src="https://fractlstaging.com/clients/fractl-marketing/fractl-survey-of-500-journalists/?initialWidth=501&amp;amp;childId=asset&amp;amp;parentTitle=500%20Journalists%20Share%20Their%20Pitching%20Pet%20Peeves%20%7C%20Fractl&amp;amp;parentUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frac.tl%2Fwork%2Fmarketing-research%2Fpitching-pet-peeves%2F" width="100%" height="513px" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Top Ten Worst PR Tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To summarize our findings in their entirety, these are the top ten worst pet peeves regarding PR pitches with which journalists struggle:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Hasn’t researched your work / Irrelevant to your beat&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Hasn’t researched the publication you write for&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Too many follow-ups&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Self-promotional without a real story&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Cold calling&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Mass email blasts&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Generic angle to a common story&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Lack of cooperation or transparency (i.e. broken embargoes)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Not personalized&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Copy of a press release&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Remember -- even if you avoid the ten bad practices above, it's still not guaranteed that your pitch will be well-received.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The first step to earning press mentions for your client is to create a survey, study, or interactive so compelling, newsworthy, or surprising that a writer can't resist covering it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The second step is to build an outreach list full of online writers and editors that often cover the niche your content falls into to ensure the content is relevant to their audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The third step is to neatly and succinctly pack the most interesting data into an email pitch that communicates the gist of your content without being too self-promotional or generic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps, and you'll be well on your way to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-guest-post-pitch-example"&gt;building positive&lt;/a&gt;, mutually beneficial relationships with the media.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/a-simple-guide-to-marketing-ROI.jpg" alt="a-simple-guide-to-marketing-ROI" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you launch a new marketing campaign, you should test whether the cost of the project is helping or hurting your company. To determine something's profitability, many marketers look at ROI -- or return on investment. At the most basic level, ROI compares the amount of money you spend on a project with the amount of revenue you gain from it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you launch a new marketing campaign, you should test whether the cost of the project is helping or hurting your company. To determine something's profitability, many marketers look at ROI -- or return on investment. At the most basic level, ROI compares the amount of money you spend on a project with the amount of revenue you gain from it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder why we never saw a third sequel to the &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"&gt;Jim Carrey&lt;/a&gt; classic, &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315327/"&gt;Bruce Almighty&lt;/a&gt;? One major reason could be the disastrous ROI of 2007's &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"&gt;Evan Almighty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A few years after 2003's Bruce Almighty &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brucealmighty.htm"&gt;grossed over $484 million&lt;/a&gt;, a sequel was made that starred &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"&gt;The Office&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136797/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"&gt;Steve Carell&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 2007's &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1"&gt;Evan Almighty&lt;/a&gt;, God, played by Morgan Freeman, commands Carell to build an arc like the biblical figure, Noah. The movie's marketing, award-winning cast, and special effects might have seemed promising at the time. But its production costs led to it having the biggest budget of any comedy film at &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-evanvsbruce6jul6-story.html"&gt;$250 million&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;After the studio, cast, and crew spent huge amounts of time and money on the film, it only made a dismal &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-evanvsbruce6jul6-story.html"&gt;$67 million&lt;/a&gt; in its first two weeks of release.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Bruce Almighty, which had a budget &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brucealmighty.htm"&gt;slightly over $80 million&lt;/a&gt;, made nearly the same amount in its opening weekend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While this example looks at ROI on an incredibly large scale, the strategy of measuring your returns can be incredibly helpful to marketers or small businesses as they learn which tactics are and aren't worth repeating.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Determining one overall marketing ROI benchmark is challenging because all marketing tactics are different.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with an online ad strategy like PPC, where ROI data is usually tracked automatically, you might be able to easily see how your ad's return compares to others that are similar. Platforms like Google Ads also have years of extensive data to back up their reported &lt;a href="/marketing/ppc-tools?_ga=2.73479377.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;800% ROI&lt;/a&gt; benchmark.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're dealing with other strategies, like content marketing, it might be hard to tell if your blog posts, podcasts, or videos are leading directly to a purchase -- especially when the content isn't on or linked directly to a landing page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the &lt;a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2019/05/real-roi-content/"&gt;Content Marketing Institute&lt;/a&gt; says that determining ROI has felt like a mystery to marketers for decades. Although the invention of tracking URLs and other technology has helped to determine the success of content, CMI still suggests looking at ROI from a long-term perspective and factoring in non-financial gains including audience growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For most businesses, one good way to set a "good ROI" benchmark for each marketing strategy is to look at the return from similar tactics you've tried in the past, as well as your current sales numbers. That information should help you create ROI benchmarks and goals that are realistic for your company.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to calculating marketing ROI, here's a simple formula you can follow:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To use the marketing ROI formula, you'll need to identify the following things:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of leads: &lt;/strong&gt;How many people &lt;a href="/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht?_ga=2.175636321.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;converted to a lead&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead-to-customer rate: &lt;/strong&gt;What percentage of leads became a customer? If 12 out of 100 leads become a customer, your lead to customer rate would be 12% or 0.12.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average sales price: &lt;/strong&gt;The average price of your product. An average can be helpful if you occasionally apply discounts or alter pricing in other ways.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost or ad spend:&lt;/strong&gt; How much did you spend on creating and promoting the marketing campaign? Here, you can factor in costs including &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/smartphone-ecommerce-digital-ad-spend"&gt;ad spend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-track-content-roi?_ga=2.175636321.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;hourly wages of people who put time into the project&lt;/a&gt;, or costs related to producing content.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're terrible at math, don't worry. HubSpot customers can &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/ads/configure-the-calculation-of-roi-for-paid-ad-campaigns?_ga=2.175636321.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;access an ROI calculator&lt;/a&gt; programmed with the same formula in our CRM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Aside from looking at hard revenue, you might also want to consider other non-financial elements when determining if a marketing strategy is successful. These could include follows or likes on social media, unexpected traffic to your website, or even a sense of increased trust from your customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While these things don't offer an immediate financial return, they might indirectly boost purchases or customer relationships later on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we'll give you a few tips on how to determine financial ROI for six common marketing strategies. We'll also describe a few fictional small-business marketing scenarios to show you how to use the ROI formula.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Marketing ROI Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Written Content&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In our 2018 State of Inbound Report, we saw that &lt;a href="http://www.stateofinbound.com/"&gt;82% of marketers who blog&lt;/a&gt; see positive ROI in their Inbound Marketing strategy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although it might cost less to produce a blog post than a video, written content can still cost you time and money. If blogging is part of your marketing strategy, you'll want to calculate time-related costs, production costs, and promotional costs into your total spend. To translate time into a dollar amount, &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-track-content-roi?_ga=2.175636321.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;track the number of hours that an employee spent on the project&lt;/a&gt;, then multiply that number by their hourly wage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a blogger is paid $20 an hour and takes four hours to write a promotional post, your total cost will be $80 in labor plus any costs related to promoting the post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your blog links to a landing page, you'll want to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht"&gt;use a tracking URL&lt;/a&gt; instead of a basic page URL so you can see how many visitors are coming to the page directly from the blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Through tracking visits, leads, and customer conversions related to a blog post or article, you can see how efficient your strategy is. If you're creating content that generates ROI, but realize that writing time is taking too long, you might want to look for ways to streamline that process. If you're not getting ROI, you might want to make other adjustments to your plan or pivot to a new marketing strategy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A law firm that focuses on housing-related cases wants to gain more clients. They write five blog posts about tenant rights. Each post includes a tracking URL that links to a landing page where prospects can request a free legal consultation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The firm spent $900 paying employees to draft five blog posts and $100 to promote it. The posts result in eight leads -- four of which become clients. The firm made an average of $2,000 per client.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's how their ROI would be calculated:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[((8 x 0.5 x $2,000) - $1,000) ÷ $1,000] x 100 = $700&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If this rate of return works for the firm, they might want to continue the strategy as is. If they like the strategy but want to increase the ROI, they might try creating a video to see if it's more effective or try to churn out posts at a higher frequency.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Email Marketing&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While some might think email is outdated, it's actually still a key marketing tool. In fact, a business can &lt;a href="/marketing/email-marketing-stats?_ga=2.267990733.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;make $38 dollars for every dollar they spend&lt;/a&gt; on an email. Although the ROI may depend on how big a mailing list is, the type of ad in the email, or the audience the email targets, this marketing strategy still might be worth a company's time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you might not need to track production time for a linked ad or CTA in an email, you'll still want to be tracking the traffic it drives to your site. Like the written content example above, we suggest &lt;a href="/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht?_ga=2.267990733.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;using a tracking URL&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of how a company might measure ROI of email marketing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A local dog daycare offers a weekly e-newsletter to customers and those who sign up on their website. An organic dog food company pays them $100 to place an ad that links to a purchasing page for their newest product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because the ad is linked with a tracking URL, the dog food company can see that it drove 50 visitors to their product page. Of those visitors, 20 placed the dog food in their cart and 17 purchased it. That ROI formula would look like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[((20 x .85 x $20) - $100) ÷ $100] x 100 = $240&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After seeing how much money they gained from the newsletter, the dog food company might continue to place ads in that weekly email. They might also want to branch out to other dog-related emails.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Video Marketing&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A whopping &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data"&gt;83% of marketers&lt;/a&gt; say video gives them strong ROI. But like any type of content marketing, you'll need to spend time and money on producing videos. You might even need to buy or rent film equipment or editing software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you script and produce a marketing video, &lt;a href="/marketing/make-a-marketing-video?_ga=2.267990733.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;use these tips to film it affordably&lt;/a&gt;. You'll also want to keep track of the total cost of labor, equipment, and promotion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You should be sure to identify ways that you'll measure your video's effectiveness. For example, if you upload a video to social media platforms, you should &lt;a href="/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht?_ga=2.267073485.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;include a tracking URL&lt;/a&gt; in the post caption that leads to the product's landing page. This way, you can see how many visitors were driven to the page because of the video post.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A sales AI software company is launching a new product that automates many menial tasks within the sales process. The company has a landing page for demo signups, but they haven't generated many leads. They think it's because the average sales person isn't understanding what this AI technology can do to help them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The team decides to make a demo video to show sales reps how the software works and how it can help them cut down on time-consuming tasks. The video is shared on LinkedIn along with a tracking link to the demo signup landing page. The video is also placed on the landing page itself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It cost the company $300 to buy video supplies and $200 in labor to produce the video. After it was circulated, it resulted in five demo signups which lead to three purchases of the $2,000 product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's their formula:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[((5 x 0.6 x $2,000) - $500) ÷ $500] x 100 = $1,100&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since they made $1,100, the software company might continue making demo videos. Now that they've already made a one-time purchase of supplies, they also wouldn't need to calculate that cost into ROI of future projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sponsored Content&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When a brand doesn't have time or bandwidth to produce their own branded media, they might pay another person, publisher, or company to &lt;a href="/marketing/sponsored-content-that-doesnt-suck"&gt;create sponsored content&lt;/a&gt;. While staffing someone outside of your office will cost your company money, you might want to think of the extra hours your team will have to do other productive projects if they don't have to create content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you don't need to track labor costs of your own employees, you will want to use the ROI formula to see how the payment for the sponsored content compares to the amount of money you gained from the campaign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A boutique wants to promote their new line of summer dresses, but they don't have time or equipment to make a video. They connect with a local fashion influencer and pay her $300 to do an Instagram video titled, "The Best Summer Dresses for 2019."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They tell the influencer to place a tracking URL to the online store in her bio. She also directs viewers to the bio in the video's caption. Through the tracking link, the boutique can see that they've gotten 50 visits. Of those visits, 30 people put an item in their cart. Ten purchased one of the $50 dresses.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They use this formula to calculate their ROI:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[((10 x 0.33 x $50) - $300) ÷ $300] x 100 = -$45&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because they lost money on this, the boutique might want to move away from influencer marketing and invest on in-house strategies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If they realized they gained more of a social media following, or more traffic than usual, they might still want to continue with the influencer. But to see if they can improve ROI, they might have her post the same video and link on more social platforms to see if gains more traction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;PPC Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With pay-per-click, &lt;a href="/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.267073485.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;you're paying for every click your ad gets&lt;/a&gt;, even if it doesn't lead to a sale. While Google says its advertisers &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc-tools"&gt;get a strong ROI&lt;/a&gt;, small businesses still waste &lt;a href="/marketing/ppc-tools?_ga=2.267073485.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;25% of their budget&lt;/a&gt; on poorly managed PPC campaigns. After your ad is launched, you'll want to closely monitor ROI and wasted spend to learn from and avoid major losses on an ad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="/marketing/ppc-tools?_ga=2.267073485.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;a number of tools&lt;/a&gt; that can help you monitor and manage live PPC campaigns. You can also use our ROI formula to look at your ad's performance. Here's an example that shows you how:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An online gardening store wants to use a PPC ad to spread awareness of a new line of luxury lawn mowers -- which cost $1,000 each.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On their first campaign, where the price isn't shown, they spent $1,000. Of the visitors they received, three placed the item in their cart and one made a purchase. In the next campaign, they included the price. They spent a total of $500. Of their web visitors, 12 placed the lawnmower in a cart and seven purchased it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To see how the PPC ad's script change impacted ROI, the garden store could use the formula for both campaigns. They could count users who carted the product as a lead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First Campaign: &lt;i&gt;[((3 x .33 x $1,000) - $1,000) ÷ $1,000] x 100 = -$1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Second Campaign: &lt;i&gt;[((12 x .583 x $1,000) - $500) ÷ $500] x 100. = $129.92&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From this comparison, the company is able to see how price transparency can cause more qualified leads to click on the ad. They also might realize that price transparency helps them avoid paying for the clicks of people who can't afford the lawn mower.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Paid Social Media Promotion&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If a company has an audience that regularly uses social media, like &lt;a href="/marketing/boost-social-media-posts?_ga=2.65270637.297321415.1563196412-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, they might want to consider boosting one of their posts so it's promoted on newsfeeds of target audiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With most social promotions, you'll be able to set a goal or audience target, a time limit, and a budget. Tracking your ROI can help you determine if the social boost strategy is working, as well as the types of posts that lead to the best return.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A lifestyle publication is trying to gain web subscriptions, which cost $10 a month. They decide to offer a one-month free trial to pull in leads. They create a post about the trial for Twitter which includes a tracking URL that leads to the free-trial landing page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They boost the post for four days with a budget of $25 per day. In the timespan of the posted boost, they'd received 100 visitors and 20 signed up for a free trial. Of the 20, four become paid subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's the calculation:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[((20 x .2 x $10) - $100) ÷ $100] x 100 = -$60&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because the publication lost $60 and still has to honor the free subscriptions they gave out, they might decide to avoid boosting posts on this platform. If they haven't given up on a boosting strategy just yet, they might try paid promotion on another social platform next time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Best Practices of Measuring Marketing ROI&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to marketing, determining ROI can seem tricky. While more traditional PPC and social media ads can provide more specific rates of return, it can still be challenging to link hard revenue numbers to marketing content like videos and blogs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which marketing strategy you're using, monitoring the following factors can help you determine if your campaigns are really successful:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time: &lt;/strong&gt;How much time did it take to create the marketing materials?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production Costs: &lt;/strong&gt;Track the total cost of supplies, services, and software needed to create the campaign.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotional Costs: &lt;/strong&gt;Did you spend anything for promotion? If so, add that to your total costs.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page Analytics:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht"&gt;tracking URL&lt;/a&gt; to determine if your content is driving traffic to your product's landing page.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Financial Returns:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you gain any social media engagement, unexpected traffic boosts, or other bonuses from your campaign? If so, this could still be helping your level of brand awareness.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>19 of the Best Landing Page Design Examples You Need to See in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/landing-page-design-examples.jpg" alt="landing-page-design-examples" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;How do you convince your visitors to take the plunge on your website?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are so many elements that a top-notch landing page needs, and making those elements the "best" they can be often depends on what your landing page goals are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How do you convince your visitors to take the plunge on your website?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are so many elements that a top-notch landing page needs, and making those elements the "best" they can be often depends on what your landing page goals are.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Take form length, for example. It's just one of the many components you need to optimize, but best practices will tell you that both short and long forms perform well -- it all depends on whether you want to generate a lot of (potentially) lower-quality form submissions, or a smaller number of higher-quality submissions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So if you're looking to &lt;a href="http://pearl.stylemixthemes.com/landing/"&gt;up your landing page game&lt;/a&gt;, it's helpful to know what goes into a great landing page and see a few examples of these nuanced elements in action.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click one of the links below to jump to that section of the article:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#Landing-Page-Examples"&gt;Landing Page Design Examples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#Landing-Page-Ideas"&gt;Landing Page Ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, when I started doing research into landing page examples, I realized there are hardly any sites out there with modern, impressive landing page designs that are more than just a sign-up form on a homepage. So, we decided to compile a list of landing pages we love ourselves.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One big caveat here:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't have access to the stats for these pages, so I can't tell you how well they convert visitors, leads, and customers. Still, these examples -- even those that are no longer active on the business's website -- have some of the best combinations of those nuanced landing page elements I've ever seen.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if you feel inspired to try any of these tactics on your own site, the only way to know whether they'll work for you for sure is by testing them out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Landing Page Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Shopify&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Muzzle&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;TransferWise&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Airbnb&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Teambit&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Wistia&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Webflow&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Nauto&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Industrial Strength Marketing&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Inbound Emotion&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Velaro Live Chat&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;IMPACT Branding &amp;amp; Design&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Unbounce&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Bills.com&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Trulia&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Landbot&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Webprofits&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;H.BLOOM&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Conversion Lab&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sign-Up Landing Pages&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.shopify.com/free-trial"&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like many of the other landing pages in this post, Shopify's trial landing page keeps it simple. The user-oriented headline is just a few words, for example, and the page relies on simple bullets, not paragraphs, to communicate the trial's details and benefits. There are only a few fields you need to fill out before you get started. All of this makes it easier for you to get to the point: selling online with their tool.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/shopify-blog-1.png" alt="Shopify sign-up landing page" class="alignCenter shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://muzzleapp.com/"&gt;Muzzle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Landing pages help users decide whether or not your product or service is actually worth their precious time and energy. What better way to clearly and straightforwardly communicate your value proposition than by confronting visitors with the very problem your app solves?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Muzzle, a mac app that silences on-screen notifications, fully embraces this &lt;em&gt;show don't tell&lt;/em&gt; mentality on their otherwise minimal landing page. Visitors to the page are greeted with a rapid-fire onslaught of embarrassing notifications in the upper left of the screen. Not only is the animation hilarious, it also manages to compellingly convey the app's usefulness without lengthly descriptions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/muzzle-1.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=muzzle-1.gif" class="alignCenter shadow" alt="Muzzle sign-up landing page with yellow download button" width="669" title="muzzle-1.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://transferwise.com/us/"&gt;TransferWise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;TransferWise allows you to send and receive money in different currencies, and its landing page, shown below, separates each individual action so you're not distracted by options that don't apply to you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to send money, the transfer form is right there on the right for you to fill out. To receive money, simply click to the middle tab, and to sign up for TransferWise using your debit card, click to the far-right tab.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each tab on this landing page produces a different call-to-action based on what you're signing up for -- each of them in a vibrant green box to highlight your next step after your three possible starting points.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/transferwise-landing-page-1.png" alt="TransferWise sign-up landing page with CTAs for sending money, receiving money, and TransferWise debit card"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com/host/homes?from_nav=1"&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To help convert visitors into hosts, Airbnb offers some enticing personalization: an estimated weekly average earnings projection based on your location. You can enter additional information about your potential accommodations into the fields to get an even more customized estimation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you visit the page already convinced, the clear call-to-action at the top of the page makes it easy to convert on the spot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/airbnb-5.png" alt="Airbnb sign-up landing page" class="alignCenter shadow" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://teambit.io"&gt;Teambit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whimsical&lt;/em&gt; isn't usually the first word that comes to mind when you think of HR software, but Teambit's illustration-heavy landing page is exactly that. A simple, one-field form is accompanied by a delightful office full of animal characters -- all of whom are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleased with Teambit, in case you were wondering. An animal cartoon appears beside each informational section of the landing page, keeping visitors scrolling down to learn more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Teambit's landing page is perfect proof that you don't need to have a conventionally "fun" product or service offering to create a fun landing page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/teambit-1.png" alt="Teambit landing page with CTA to sign up with Google" class="alignCenter shadow" style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://teambit.io"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see the whole landing page.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;6. &lt;a href="http://wistia.com/free/new/"&gt;Wistia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First up is Wistia's landing page for their Free Wistia Account. Right off the bat, you notice the one-field form to create your account -- the blue, minimally patterned background contrasts nicely with the bright white form field.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The length of the form field combined with the prominent placement eliminates nearly all friction to create an account ... but if you're having doubts, you can always scroll below to read answers to top FAQs. By separating these two sections with stark color contrast, Wistia makes it much easier for you focus on converting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/wisita-landing-page-example.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;name=wisita-landing-page-example.png" alt="wisita-landing-page-example.png" width="660" style="width: 660px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://webflow.com/"&gt;Webflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Webflow, a design tool for web developers, packs a lot of information into just a GIF and three form fields. Having the entire sign-up form on a single line is a nice touch here -- not only does it make the page shorter, but filling out each box from left to right shows users how close they are to clicking the fourth blue button and getting started for free.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The animated GIF below the form is visible in the same frame on the website, so users can see how the product works &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sign up without scrolling or clicking over to a new page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/webflow-landing-page.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Sign-up landing page by Webflow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Ebook Landing Pages&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.nauto.com/roadmap-for-a-safer-and-smarter-fleet-ebook"&gt;Nauto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nauto, a data platform for self-driving cars, helps make autonomous driving safer for companies who manage fleets of self-driving vehicles. Naturally, its customers would need all kinds of information to sell them on this platform. Nauto has it, packaged into a super-simple ebook whose landing page gives you both a brief contact form and some preview statistics to prove why this resource is so important.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nauto-ebook-landing-page.png?width=690&amp;amp;name=nauto-ebook-landing-page.png" width="690" style="width: 690px;" alt="Nauto ebook landing page with green Download button"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the page, shown above, a warm photo of a car's interior hugs the &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms"&gt;lead-capturing form&lt;/a&gt;. The green "Download Now" button might've even been on purpose (on the road, green means go, after all).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Scroll down, and you'll see another "Get the eBook" CTA to remind users what's waiting for them. You'll also see three jarring statistics about car accidents to entice users to learn more. Check it out below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nauto-ebook-landing-page-CTA-1.png?width=690&amp;amp;name=nauto-ebook-landing-page-CTA-1.png" alt="nauto-ebook-landing-page-CTA-1" width="690" style="width: 690px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;9. &lt;a href="http://marketstrong.com/responsive-site-guide/"&gt;Industrial Strength Marketing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, this landing page pulls me in with a compelling, punchy header: "Don't Make Me Zoom." It directly speaks to a common experience most of us have had when we're browsing on our phones or tablets -- and it's a little sassy, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the only thing keeping me interested in this landing page. Notice how the color red is strategically placed: It's right at the top and bottom of the form, drawing you even closer to the conversion event.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/industrial-strength-marketing-landing-page-example.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=738&amp;amp;name=industrial-strength-marketing-landing-page-example.png" alt="industrial-strength-marketing-landing-page-example.png" width="660" height="738"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Plus, this design is meta to boot: It looks and works great on mobile, too. Keep in mind that a lot of visitors will be accessing your landing pages on their smartphones or tablets, and if the design of your website doesn't work well for them, they might give up and leave your page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The folks at Industrial Strength Marketing made the fonts and form field big enough so that visitors don't have to pinch-to-zoom to read and interact with the content, for example.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/industrial-strength-marketing-mobile-landing-page-1.jpg?width=450&amp;amp;name=industrial-strength-marketing-mobile-landing-page-1.jpg" alt="industrial-strength-marketing-mobile-landing-page-1.jpg" width="450" style="width: 450px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/industrial-strength-marketing-mobile-landing-page-2.jpg?width=450&amp;amp;name=industrial-strength-marketing-mobile-landing-page-2.jpg" alt="industrial-strength-marketing-mobile-landing-page-2.jpg" width="450" style="width: 450px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.inboundemotion.com/es/diccionario-inbound-marketing"&gt;Inbound Emotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't speak Spanish, you can still appreciate the conversion capabilities of this HubSpot partner site. My two favorite features of the page? The form stays in a fixed, prominent position as you scroll through the site. I also love the hands that serve as directional cues toward filling out the form and sharing the page with others.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2340359448-gif/00-Blog-Related_Images/inbound-emotion-1.gif?width=580&amp;amp;height=364&amp;amp;name=inbound-emotion-1.gif" alt="inbound-emotion-1" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" width="580" height="364"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;11. &lt;a href="http://www.velaro.com/resources/proactive-chat-whitepaper/"&gt;Velaro Live Chat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the smallest details make the biggest difference. They're what make Velaro Live Chat's landing page awesome, for example.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That small PDF symbol over the feature image helps set expectations for what format the download will be in. The arrow in front of the subheadline helps further direct your attention to important copy they want visitors to read. Like IMPACT, they also have an auto-checked box to subscribe to their newsletter on their form -- which, if turned into an opt-in check box, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/double-blogging-email-subscribers-ht"&gt;is a great way to increase subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. All of these small, seemingly insignificant details help bring together a solid, admirable landing page design.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/velaro-landing-page-example-1.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=1032&amp;amp;name=velaro-landing-page-example-1.png" alt="velaro-landing-page-example-1.png" width="1032" style="width: 1032px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://offers.impactbnd.com/the-beginners-guide-to-inbound-marketing"&gt;IMPACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.impactbnd.com/generate-more-leads-from-blog"&gt; Branding &amp;amp; Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: IMPACT is a HubSpot partner -- but that's not why they're included here. IMPACT's landing pages have long been a source of design inspiration. I love the simple layout of the page, from the large headline copy and detailed featured image, to the outline that surrounds the form, to the colors and fonts that are very pleasing to the eye.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The free guide IMPACT is offering for download here also doesn't emphasize the download itself in the blue button that allows you to submit your filled-out form. Rather, IMPACT is inviting you to "generate more conversions" -- putting the focus on what you stand to gain as a result of reading the guide.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/impact-landing-page-example-2.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;name=impact-landing-page-example-2.png" alt="impact-landing-page-example-2.png" width="660" style="width: 660px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Landing Pages to Learn More&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;13. &lt;a href="http://do.thelandingpagecourse.com/"&gt;Unbounce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise Unbounce is near the top of this list -- they've actually &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/conversion-centered-design"&gt;written the book on creating high-converting landing pages&lt;/a&gt;. Although there are lots of amazing things about this landing page, the two that I absolutely love are: &lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; The use of a chat window instead of a classic form, and &lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; the detailed -- but well packaged -- information below the form.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The first helps direct attention to the goal of the page -- for you to fill out the form -- in a way that's unobtrusive and feels less like a chore. The second gives this page an SEO boost (search engines will have more content to crawl) and assuages any worry from folks who need to know more about a piece of content before handing over their information, all while not distracting people from the chat window.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-20%20at%2011.21.12%20AM.png?width=630&amp;amp;height=1310&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-20%20at%2011.21.12%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-20 at 11.21.12 AM.png" width="630" height="1310"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://debt.bills.com/save"&gt;Bills.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Often, people think landing pages are static pages on your website. But with the right tools, you can make them interactive and personalized.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take the example below from Bills.com. To see if you'd benefit from their consultation, you answer three questions before you are shown a form. It starts with this one:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bills-dot-com-landing-page-example.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;name=bills-dot-com-landing-page-example.png" alt="bills-dot-com-landing-page-example.png" width="660" style="width: 660px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Then, you answer two more questions, like the one below:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bills-dot-com-landing-page-2.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=216&amp;amp;name=bills-dot-com-landing-page-2.png" alt="bills-dot-com-landing-page-2.png" width="660" height="216"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;And here's the final landing page form where you fill out your information:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bills-dot-com-landing-page-3.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=472&amp;amp;name=bills-dot-com-landing-page-3.png" alt="bills-dot-com-landing-page-3.png" width="660" height="472"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how the algorithm works (or if there's one at all), but while I was filling it out, I had some anxiety about &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; qualifying. Once I found out I did, I was excited to fill out the form, which I'm sure most people who are in debt and using this tool are. By making this offer seem more exclusive before the form appeared on the landing page, I'd bet that Bills.com increased conversions pretty significantly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;15. &lt;a href="http://www.trulia.com/sell"&gt;Trulia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Trulia did something very similar to Bills.com with their landing page. It starts with a simple form asking for "an address" (which sounds less creepy than "your address," although that's what they mean). Below this simple form field is a bright orange button that contrasts well with the hero image behind the form, and emphasizes that the estimate will be personalized to your home.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/trulia-landing-page-example.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=463&amp;amp;name=trulia-landing-page-example.png" alt="trulia-landing-page-example.png" width="660" height="463"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the address itself won't be enough to estimate the value of a home. It just denotes the home's neighborhood. That's why the next page follows with more questions about the property itself, like number of beds and baths. Below, you see the copy "Tell us where to send the report" -- with a disclaimer that, by entering this information, you're agreeing to connect with a real estate agent. This is a great example of a company giving value to their visitors from the get-go, while setting visitors' expectations about what will happen as a result.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/trulia-landing-page-2.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=951&amp;amp;name=trulia-landing-page-2.png" alt="trulia-landing-page-2.png" width="660" height="951"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;16. &lt;a href="https://landbot.io/ph/index.html"&gt;Landbot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Landbot, a service that creates chatbot-based landing pages, puts their own product front and center on their chat-fueled landing page. Visitors are greeted by a friendly bot -- complete with emojis and GIFs -- who encourages them to provide information in a conversational format, instead of via a traditional form.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/landbot.gif" alt="landbot.gif" class="alignCenter shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;17. &lt;a href="https://www.webprofits.com.au/backlinks/"&gt;Webprofits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For a little contrast ... what about long landing pages? With just a few tricks, you can make even the longest landing page feel short. Webprofits' landing page below shows us how.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Right at the top, there's a prominent CTA button to learn more -- with a nice contrast against the background so it stands out, and a downward arrow to encourage scrolling. By not putting a form field up front, they help reduce friction and create an opportunity for visitors to learn more before being presented with a conversion option.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They also make it easy for you to figure out what Webprofits actually &lt;em&gt;does. &lt;/em&gt;The rest of the page offers detailed information about what you'll get when you give over your information. Plus, it includes strategic CTAs throughout to take you back to the top to fill out the form, like "Let's Talk."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-20%20at%201.36.52%20PM-1.png" alt="Screen Shot 2017-07-20 at 1.36.52 PM-1.png" class="alignCenter shadow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;18. &lt;a href="http://www.hbloom.com/ResidentialSubscriptions/"&gt;H.BLOOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you've just got to stop and admire a landing page for being beautiful. Using high-resolution photography and lots of white space, H.BLOOM's landing page is a pleasure to look at.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Aside from its beauty, the page has some great conversions elements: an above-the-fold form, clear and concise description of what'll happen when you fill out the form, and even the bright orange "Submit" button. The only thing we'd change up? The copy on the "Submit" button -- that could be more specific to the offer at hand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2346232040-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/hbloom-1.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=580&amp;amp;height=738&amp;amp;name=hbloom-1.png" alt="hbloom-1" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;" width="580" height="738"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;19. &lt;a href="http://conversionlab.no/"&gt;Conversion Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While I wouldn't typically include an example of a homepage with a form on it in a post about landing pages, this website is special. The homepage is the entire website -- the navigation links just take you to the information below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you click "Get Help With Landing Pages," the entire site moves over to make room for the form. Here's what it looks like before you click:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/conversion-lab-landing-page-1.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=472&amp;amp;name=conversion-lab-landing-page-1.png" alt="conversion-lab-landing-page-1.png" width="660" height="472"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And, when you click that CTA, check out how the form appears:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/conversion-lab-landing-page-2.png?noresize&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=463&amp;amp;name=conversion-lab-landing-page-2.png" alt="conversion-lab-landing-page-2.png" width="660" height="463"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I love how you don't have to leave the page to fill out the form, yet the form won't feel intrusive to casual website visitors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Landing Page Ideas&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A well-optimized landing page can transform prospects into leads by gathering information that can help you better understand, market to, and delight visitors. Since landing pages are crucial for conversions, it's important to make sure they're well &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-optimize-landing-pages-for-conversion?_ga=2.264429069.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;planned, designed, and executed&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things to keep in mind when creating landing pages:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appealing aesthetics: &lt;/strong&gt;Giving your landing page color and a clean UI can only help. Visitors will want to learn more about your products and see evidence of the value you're offering. Take a look at #10 on our list -- Inbound Emotion -- for a great example of a stunning web page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less is more: &lt;/strong&gt;Let the offer or images do most of the talking, but be sure to include any and all descriptive headlines and supporting text to make your landing page clear and compelling. This goes for just about all the components on the page: try white space, simple copy, and shorter forms.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep visitors on the page: &lt;/strong&gt;By &lt;a href="/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33927/11-simple-but-critical-tips-for-creating-better-landing-pages.aspx?_ga=2.58905903.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;removing the main navigation&lt;/a&gt; or any distracting backlinks, it's less likely there will be any &lt;a href="/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29396/Master-Online-Lead-Generation-by-Reducing-Friction.aspx?_ga=2.58905903.367580586.1563374290-527251855.1560789477"&gt;lead generation friction&lt;/a&gt; that could cause visitors to abandon your page.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Sharing: &lt;/strong&gt;A simple way of getting visitors to engage with your landing page is including social media sharing buttons so that they can spread your content to their social followings. After all, customers are the center of your &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel"&gt;marketing flywheel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A/B testing: &lt;/strong&gt;Landing pages are important to get right, and since consumer psychology can sometimes be surprising, it's always better to experiment with different versions of your pages to see which has the highest conversion rate (CVR). Test the positioning of the offer, kinds of CTAs, or even the color scheme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call-To-Action: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/call-to-action-templates?_ga=2.61774636.1056808278.1563196748-527251855.1560789477"&gt;CTA&lt;/a&gt; is where the meat of the landing page is, or the tipping point where prospects become contacts. CTAs could ask visitors to subscribe, download, fill out a form, share on social media, and more -- but, overall, CTAs are necessary for getting your audiences more engaged with your offering. To generate leads, CTAs should be bold and eye-catching, but most importantly, they need to effectively communicate value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example of a creative CTA is Landbot -- seen here at #16 -- who has a chat box landing where their CTA is responding in the chat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;a class="close"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;span class="hs-cta-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="hs-cta-node hs-cta-0f11da36-e309-45fe-bf55-8004ef10cf96"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/0f11da36-e309-45fe-bf55-8004ef10cf96"&gt;&lt;img class="hs-cta-img" style="border-width: 0px;" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0f11da36-e309-45fe-bf55-8004ef10cf96.png" alt="Free Guide Optimize Landing Pages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Seven Strategies Women Can Use to Navigate the Glass Cliff [Infographic]</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-glass-cliff-infographic</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-glass-cliff-infographic" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/glass-cliff-strategies.jpg" alt="glass-cliff-strategies" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Women have been talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/glass-ceiling-effect-its-impact-on-women/"&gt;glass ceiling for years&lt;/a&gt; ... but have you heard about the glass cliff?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Women have been talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/glass-ceiling-effect-its-impact-on-women/"&gt;glass ceiling for years&lt;/a&gt; ... but have you heard about the glass cliff?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon describes how women who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; finally shatter the proverbial glass ceiling are promoted or appointed during times of company strife -- when risk of failure is greatest.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Women have been working hard to close the gender gap in business. Women now earn more graduate degrees than men, &lt;a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/small-business-loans-for-women"&gt;secure business loans&lt;/a&gt; to launch their own startups, and dedicate their careers to climbing the corporate ladder at some of the world's top companies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And yet, despite these strides, only &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/2018s-fortune-500-companies-have-just-24-female-ceos.html"&gt;4.8 percent of the world's top companies&lt;/a&gt; are led by women -- and this number is actually lower than it was 15 years ago, when the glass cliff was first discovered.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, psychologists Michelle Ryan and Alex Haslam first &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20159315?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"&gt;labelled the phenomenon known as the glass cliff&lt;/a&gt; after an article in the U.K. &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; stated that companies with women on boards of the London Stock Exchange performed poorly compared to companies led completely by men.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After reading the article, Ryan and Haslam decided to take a closer look at the numbers and discovered that women were only offered positions on boards of companies that were already underperforming.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since their initial findings, other studies have backed up their research and uncovered that not only are women more likely to be appointed during times of turmoil, but they're also &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3264494"&gt;45% more likely to be removed as CEO&lt;/a&gt; compared to their male counterparts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One high profile example of the glass cliff is Carly Fiorina, who was appointed CEO at Hewlett-Packard as a transformational leader who would take the company in a new direction after low performance. After pursuing a controversial merger she became embroiled with board member Walter Hewlett and was subsequently fired. After her removal, the Hewlett-Packard board &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/alexis-grenell-dangling-carly-fiorina-cliff-article-1.2344916"&gt;acknowledged that her merger would have been the right decision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although the glass cliff is a tough pill for women in the workplace to swallow, the best way to avoid becoming another statistic is to prepare. Check out our &lt;a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-is-the-glass-cliff"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; from Fundera, below, to discover seven actionable ways to avoid falling off the glass cliff.&lt;a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-is-the-glass-cliff"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets-blog.fundera.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/06110949/glass-cliff-animation.1a-min.gif" alt="What is the Glass Cliff?" width="750"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ultimate Guide for Finding &amp; Reaching Out to Bloggers</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogger-outreach-tools</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogger-outreach-tools" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Finding-and-reaching-out-to-bloggers-2.jpg" alt="Finding-and-reaching-out-to-bloggers-2" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;The blogosphere has been a major online marketing medium for years now. Bloggers are trusted voices who can bring in customers and help you build your community. They're capable of exposing others to your message and getting the buzz started -- but only if you approach the task diligently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Reaching out to potential bloggers is a more intricate process nowadays than it was even five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;The blogosphere has been a major online marketing medium for years now. Bloggers are trusted voices who can bring in customers and help you build your community. They're capable of exposing others to your message and getting the buzz started -- but only if you approach the task diligently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Reaching out to potential bloggers is a more intricate process nowadays than it was even five years ago. Great bloggers are constantly getting pitched by marketers, making it all the more important for you to stand out from the crowd if you want them to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Trust me, though: It's well worth it to invest time in building connections with high quality bloggers and turn them into a brand advocates who will be willing to help you out over and over again.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Want to achieve worthwhile results from your blogger outreach efforts? In this post, I'll go over a few tips for reaching out to bloggers effectively. Then, I'll talk about seven great blogger outreach tools that will help you connect with bloggers in your niche.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Blogger Search&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Before you start reaching out to bloggers, you'll need to figure out who you'll reach out to by doing some quick research. As you're searching for bloggers, look for people who are in your industry or in an industry that somewhat relates to your product. This way, their audience will be similar to yours and may trust the blogger more when they talk about your product or write a sponsored post about you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You'll also want to look at their following. The larger their audience is, the better the posts will be for your brand awareness. While you might not be able to see traffic or follower numbers directly on their blog page, looking at their social media channels might be a good way to distinguish how many fans they have and how engaged their audience is with their content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Blogger Outreach&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many bloggers don't mind helping your brand grow -- in fact, some of them may like what you offer. All in all, many of them will appreciate additional sources of income.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But there's always a chance one of those power bloggers will be insulted by the means or message you use to reach out to them. If you're really unlucky, they might voice their irritation in public, thereby tarnishing your reputation. So how do you reach out to the bloggers without running into a risk of ruining your brand name? As someone who's been on both sides many times, here are three tips.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are four guidelines for blogger outreach:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Tip #1: Send a straightforward email or message&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I love emails that get to the point right away. The more straightforward you are, the more time I save. But there's a fine line between being straightforward and being just plain careless.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a careless blogging -- the very one that inspired me to write this article in the first place:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2635886921-png/blogger-outreach-fiasco.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=blogger-outreach-fiasco.png" alt="blogger-outreach-fiasco" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't want your emails to end up in the bin? Take time going through active blogs in your industry (using some of the tools I talk about later), reading media kits, searching for reviews they do, and so on. Do your homework before inviting bloggers to partner.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Tip #2: Tailor your email to each blogger so it feels personal.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All bloggers are different. Some of them might be really insulted by your paid review offer, for example. This doesn't mean the same blogger may become your brand ambassador if you invite him or her to be your webinar or podcast featured guest.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead, tailor your offer based on what each of your bloggers seems to enjoy doing online. Which &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-blog-post-simple-formula-ht"&gt;types of blog posts&lt;/a&gt; do they gravitate toward? Do some research to identify the types of content each blogger is currently doing to earn his/her living so you can approach them with an attractive offer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Tip #3: Don't rely on interns to do the outreach.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I've seen far too many emails from company managers apologizing for an unprofessional email their intern sent. Don't get me wrong, interns are wonderful -- but they likely don't have much of a feel for your industry and how to navigate the politics of reaching out to other professionals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's best to entrust your company's reputation with someone more experienced with professional outreach.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Tip #4: Send a follow-up -- but don't go overboard with emails.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like any business prospect, sending a second follow-up email a few days later could show the blogger that you're interested in working with them. It might also be helpful if the first email they received got lost in the shuffle or was forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, if they seem like they are genuinely not interested or responsive, you may want to move on so you don't seem desperate or annoying. Leave them with a good impression of your company and brand, even if they don't wish to work with you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Blogger Outreach Software&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/pricing/sales?edition=starter&amp;amp;term=monthly"&gt;HubSpot Sales Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Sales Hub includes a number of features that allow you to streamline and track your outreach process. These tools include email tracking, calling and live chat capabilities, a meeting scheduler, deal tracking tools, and email or contract templates.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The software's Starter plan, which still includes a wide range of features, is $50 per month, while you can pay more for more advanced features with the Professional and Enterprise subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Below is a quick look at what you'll see when you look at prospects on the HubSpot Sales Hub. For a full demo, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/sales/demo"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HubSpot%20Sales%20Hub%20prospect%20page.jpg?width=1199&amp;amp;name=HubSpot%20Sales%20Hub%20prospect%20page.jpg" alt="HubSpot Sales Hub prospect page" width="1199" style="width: 1199px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.birdsonganalytics.com/twitter-analytics/"&gt;BirdSong Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The newest tool in my arsenal, BirdSong Analytics allows you to export anyone's Twitter follower list into an Excel file. The export includes each Twitter user's real name, bio, URL, "Verified" status, and latest tweet.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can imagine how many opportunities this feature offers: For example, you can download the list of all Twitter accounts &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:f@NYTimes"&gt;@NYTimes &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/following"&gt;is following&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and, by playing with Excel sorting and filtering features, identify those journalists who cover your niche. It's lots of fun!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2653058944-png/birdsong-analytics-tool.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=birdsong-analytics-tool.png" alt="birdsong-analytics-tool" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://buzzsumo.com/"&gt;BuzzSumo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;BuzzSumo is a search and reputation management platform, and it's always one of the first tools I use to find bloggers to reach out to.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I love the tool for many reasons, but I felt in love with it in the first place because of the ability to filter results by the time frame. This way you can see who covered your topic most recently and what kind of spread it got in social media. (The top results are your best targets.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2660485713-png/buzzsumo-tool.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=buzzsumo-tool.png" alt="buzzsumo-tool-features" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://twtrland.com/"&gt;TwtrLand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;TwtrLand is another search tool &lt;a href="http://viralcontentbuzz.com/index.php/twitter-marketing-twitter-chat-with-ronsela-vcbuzz/"&gt;I was introduced to recently&lt;/a&gt; that helps you find influencers in any skill anywhere in the world. (&lt;a href="http://twtrland.com/profile/garyvee"&gt;Here's an example&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can monitor brands on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and analyze their landscape. &lt;span&gt;From what I've learned about it so far, it appears to have much more value -- in terms of quality of results it returns -- than similar Twitter influencer search tools. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;You can search TwtrLand by skill, location and name and then filter search results by influence level, location and categories:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2652988464-png/twtrland-tool.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=twtrland-tool.png" alt="twtrland-tool-most-influencial-in-tennis-page" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://circloscope.com/"&gt;Circloscope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Circloscope is primarily a Google Plus circle management tool, and it's great way to discover niche influencers and connect with them on Google Plus. You can easily identify active and influential members from any Google Plus community, see who any of your current peers follow, and create a list of influential users attending an event or a Google hangout.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Add to this lots of filters (for example, you can set to see users who were active on Google Plus within a week or so), and you get a great influencer discovery tool.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2660480698-png/circloscope-tool.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=circloscope-tool.png" alt="circloscope-tool-edit-filters-page" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.tomoson.com/"&gt;Tomoson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This platform connects businesses to bloggers in a very flexible way. You can create projects and invite bloggers to spread the word about them on your own terms while giving both parties flexibility. (For example, &lt;a href="https://www.tomoson.com/businesses/faq-and-support#faq13"&gt;businesses cannot dictate&lt;/a&gt; the types of links bloggers are required to provide, which helps keep this platform safe from any abusive tactics.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tomoson has its own "ranking" algorithm allowing you to easier identify influencers. Businesses can also set minimum requirements to applying bloggers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2660485793-png/tomoson-tool.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=tomoson-tool.png" alt="tomoson-tool-science-fiction-fantasy-book-review" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. &lt;a href="http://myblogu.com/"&gt;MyBlogU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get a feel of the community is to become part of one. MyBlogU is one of the most action-driven platforms which serves two goals:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;To connect to bloggers by helping them. (And we all know by now that helping people is the most effective way to build long-term relationships online.)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;To get featured on their blogs by providing expert quotes to their queries.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2662079375-png/myblogu-tool.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=myblogu-tool.png" alt="myblogu-tool-expert-quote-queries" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. &lt;a href="http://twchat.com/"&gt;TwChat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28979/8-Steps-to-Hosting-a-Successful-Twitter-Chat.aspx"&gt;Twitter chats&lt;/a&gt; are my favorite way to build connections with influencers. They are open, everyone can join, and no one goes unnoticed. The TwChat tool allows you to find chats in your niche and easily participate in any of them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2660490818-png/twchat-tool.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=twchat-tool.png" alt="twchat-tool-dashboard-showing-tweets" width="669"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;img src="https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fblogger-outreach-tools&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" style="min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; "&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hey Startups, HubSpot is now giving away free CRM + Email</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-giving-away-free-crm-email</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-giving-away-free-crm-email" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/hubspot-free-crm-email.png" alt="hubspot-free-crm-email" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Many founders make the same mistake in the early days of their companies -- instead of building an integrated tech stack, they use a bunch of disconnected tools because these tools are cheap, or maybe even free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many founders make the same mistake in the early days of their companies -- instead of building an integrated tech stack, they use a bunch of disconnected tools because these tools are cheap, or maybe even free.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I know because I made this mistake.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I started my first company in my early 20s. We were a web development shop building pretty cool technology, and yet could not figure out a good system to track our sales pipeline or manage leads. I actually taught our sales team a manual process that included flipbooks of business cards and tick sheets to track who needed a follow-up. &#x1f926;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We also struggled to manage lead flow. While our Wordpress site could &lt;em&gt;collect&lt;/em&gt; leads, those leads didn't automatically sync to a CRM (we didn't even have one). Instead, leads were forwarded to our only marketer, who manually distributed them to our sales team via email. When this person was on vacation, our sales team didn't get leads. Even if they did get leads, I never knew if they were following up or not.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There was no doubt in my mind that we were losing money -- both in time spent on these manual processes and also lost deals -- but we were also creating pain for our customers and prospects. How weird is it to reach out to a company you're interested in working with only to not hear from them for days, weeks, and maybe ever?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What a mess.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, some of this was my own fault. Salesforce and email tools like Constant Contact did exist at the time. In retrospect, I was definitely suffering from what I later dubbed "poor business syndrome" -- afraid to spend what little money we had on the thing that would help us grow -- but at the same time, CRM, lead management, and email tools all together were expensive! I could never bring myself to spend the money.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It felt like I only had two choices: cough up the money for pricey tools that would give me a unified (but painfully expensive!) view of our customer experience, or just hope that prospects would be persistent in contacting us and would forgive the email we sent them that 100% lacked context on previous interactions they had with us.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As of today, no startup will ever again need to make the same concession I did.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, in addition to giving our CRM away for free, we’re also giving away free email.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that if I were a founder today using HubSpot's free tools I would know where our leads were coming from, whether or not our sales team was following up with those leads, how much money is in our pipeline, and could even write personalized emails based on where prospects are in their customer lifecycle! That's a solid sales and marketing setup for exactly $0. No hefty price tag, no pain to endure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And there's more …&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We're adding Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn Ads tools to the CRM -- for free. Now you can report on your ad campaigns across networks, and see exactly who converted on your ads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It has literally never been easier or cheaper to start a company. Our CEO, Brian Halligan showed this chart at INBOUND 2017:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8_NIQz62mRrK-yKcRq8VXtScvAgiraznjowQWihSdl0pm8nJDQZPGXwgFz3erHgv8o1XC5MoEJpht7zUzoyAe1jfLHXxLu4yIFelRXBCurjGMKbOwCH-YSpC2PLDqxUsORSq_xZj" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;With free, integrated tools it’s not only easier to startup -- it's easier to scale-up.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When companies manage customer data well, they're empowered to create great customer experiences. And we want you to start creating those great experiences on Day 1 of your business, not Day 1,000.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We want to give businesses the tools they need to be successful when they're acquiring their very first cohort of customers, so they can acquire (and retain!) future customers even faster.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're not already, I hope &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/free?_ga=2.175449186.1184505237.1563200671-1451183703.1557949920"&gt;you'll give our free tools a try today&lt;/a&gt;. Let's grow better together.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;img src="https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;amp;k=14&amp;amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhubspot-giving-away-free-crm-email&amp;amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;amp;bvt=rss" alt="" width="1" height="1" style="min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; "&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>13 Influencer Marketing Campaigns to Inspire and Get You Started With Your Own</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-of-influencer-marketing-campaigns</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-of-influencer-marketing-campaigns" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/cyreneq-snapchat-influencer.jpg" alt="cyreneq-snapchat-influencer" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;You can't go anywhere these days without hearing about the elusive, purportedly mystical powers of &lt;i&gt;influencer marketing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But is this buzzword-laden tactic actually worth your time and energy?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You can't go anywhere these days without hearing about the elusive, purportedly mystical powers of &lt;i&gt;influencer marketing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But is this buzzword-laden tactic actually worth your time and energy?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="http://go.pardot.com/l/153091/2016-11-29/9t6n1k"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; comprised of marketers from a variety of industries, &lt;strong&gt;94% said influencer marketing was an effective campaign strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; That's great news for marketers -- right?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. Even though a majority of marketers believe influencer marketing is a viable tactic, it's still incredibly challenging to report accurately on influencer campaign ROI. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/8-new-stats-about-whether-influencer-marketing-campaigns-actually-work-174868/"&gt;78% of marketers&lt;/a&gt; said that determining the success of influencer marketing campaigns would be a top challenge this year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So even though the tangible benefits of influencer marketing -- follower engagement, driving traffic, and creating more authentic content -- seem clear-cut, there's still &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of progress to be made in making this form of campaign measurable for agencies and marketers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;Influencer Marketing&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Influencer marketing is designed to tap into an existing community of engaged followers on social media. Influencers are specialists in their niches. These individuals have influence over an audience you might be trying to reach, and can be helpful marketing to those buyers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let's back up for a minute. How exactly do you perform influencer marketing, and how does it differ from the traditional celebrity spokesperson advertising model?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is some overlap between celebrity endorsements and influencer marketing campaigns. But fans of influencers trust that their endorsement of a product or brand comes from a well-researched, more holistic place, rather than something as simple as a signed contract between a brand and a person of influence.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And while there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; often a formal agreement in place between both parties, influencers tend to be more selective about their affiliations, choosing to partner with brands that reflect their unique personal brands and won't alienate their followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are four things you need to keep in mind when launching an influencer marketing campaign:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expertise:&lt;/strong&gt; Would the content of your campaign be appropriate coming from this influencer, given what he or she is famous for?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach:&lt;/strong&gt; Can this influencer engage your audience? Does she specifically have reach on the social media channels where your audience spends its time?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demographic:&lt;/strong&gt; Is this person's following similar to your company's buyer persona? Does he or she affect the same people?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notoriety:&lt;/strong&gt; Is this influencer well liked? Is his/her fame split between admiration and condemnation, or are they a person of mass appeal? (The latter is what you want, so as to not alienate potential customers.)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;strong&gt;celebrity product endorsements&lt;/strong&gt; are less about engagement and more about attaching a person's fame and name recognition to a particular brand -- regardless of who specifically follows their career. For brands, this type of campaign is much more about grabbing the attention of a wide audience than tapping into a very specific niche.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of how brands -- both big and small -- are leveraging the power of influencers in their marketing efforts, we've put together a list of ten influencer-driven campaigns. Check them out below and decide for yourself: Is influencer marketing worth the hype?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did Sprint cause &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3060648/how-sprint-got-verizons-can-you-hear-me-now-guy-to-change-teams"&gt;Verizon's famous "can you hear me now?" guy&lt;/a&gt; to switch to Sprint, but the company has collaborated with musicians, entrepreneurs, and actors to gain the attention of a massive young audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Its latest influencer campaign uses the hashtag #LiveUnlimited, and features people who have massive social media presences. The best part is these people naturally embody the appearance and lifestyle of #LiveUnlimited. Elite Daily founder &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/gerardadams/?hl=en"&gt;Gerard Adams&lt;/a&gt; and internet personality &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lelepons/?hl=en"&gt;Lele Pons&lt;/a&gt; are just two of them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sprint introduces all five influencers (listed above) in this video ad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Old Navy: Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club of America&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencer: Alex Rodriguez&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Old Navy is a veteran of influencer marketing, having partnered with fashion and lifestyle bloggers all over Instagram to promote various lines of Old Navy clothing. For Black Friday, the company doubled down on this strategy by partnering with New York Yankee retiree Alex Rodriguez to raise money for the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club of America (BGCA). Being an alumnus of the BGCA, Rodriguez's promotion helped Old Navy raise $1 million as part of sales during Black Friday alone.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;As a proud &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BGCA_Clubs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BGCA_Clubs&lt;/a&gt; , I’m excited to help &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OldNavy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@OldNavy&lt;/a&gt; in their goal to donate $1 MILLION to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs this holiday season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Fri only, for every $1 pair of Cozy Socks you buy in-store, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OldNavy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Oldnavy&lt;/a&gt; donate $1 to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BGCA_Clubs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BGCA_Clubs&lt;/a&gt; — up to 1M! &lt;a href="https://t.co/wEKhASEmuc"&gt;https://t.co/wEKhASEmuc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ad?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Ad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; — Alex Rodriguez (@AROD) 
 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AROD/status/1064660589761519621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 500; text-align: center;"&gt;3. Fiji Water: Bodyworewhat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencer: Danielle Bernstein&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You know the water brand, Fiji, but you might know its campaign partner better by the Instagram name, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/weworewhat/?hl=en"&gt;weworewhat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Bernstein's fashion blog, &lt;em&gt;We Wore What&lt;/em&gt;, recently &lt;a href="https://www.hoopygang.com/en/the-top-5-influencer-marketing-campaigns-of-2017/"&gt;joined Fiji Water&lt;/a&gt; to create Bodyworewhat, an influencer marketing campaign offering eight-minute workout videos with Bernstein and personal trainer Eric Johnson.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This campaign was meant to demonstrate Fiji's commitment to hydrating those who want to look and feel as fit as Bernstein, while helping her fans get there with all the right motivators.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BYYorYaHyIN/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7" width="300" height="609" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;    
&lt;h3&gt;4. Kaikatsu Club: NETCafe VR&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencer: Enakorin&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Not all influencers are based in sports, fashion, or entertainment -- not in Asia, anyway. The cafe chain, Kaikatsu Club, recently launched a virtual reality feature across its Japan locations, where customers can play various VR video games while enjoying a drink or a meal. And who better to help spread the word than Japan's popular TV personality and cosplayer, Enakorin.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enakorin is well known by fans of anime, a Japanese artform responsible for many comics and TV shows across the country. Enakorin is also known for her love of video games, making her a perfect choice to represent Kaikatsu's new VR entertainment platform. Both of them teamed up with TimeLine Japan on YouTube to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5EwXgjfJQk?ecver=1" width="640" height="380" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. H&amp;amp;M: Fall Studio Collection&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencers: Julie Sariñana, Ela Velden&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;M has one of the largest Instagram followings of any fashion brand on social media today, due in large part to its &lt;a href="https://www.influencerdb.net/blog/best-performing-influencer-marketing-campaigns-of-2017/"&gt;influencer campaign&lt;/a&gt; with women who reflect H&amp;amp;M's style all by themselves.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fashion blogger Julie Sariñana and model Ela Velden are two influencers with whom H&amp;amp;M partnered for its fall 2017 catalogue. Sariñana loved the clothing so much, she promoted it from her own Instagram account:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BYwIRyWgHqY/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7" width="300" height="719" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;6. Sperry: Boat Shoes on Instagram&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencers: Sperry Enthusiasts&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of 2016, the boat shoe brand, Sperry, &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/how-sperrys-micro-influencers-reach-impressive-heights-little-cost-instagram-175053/"&gt;began working&lt;/a&gt; with more than 100 micro-influencers on Instagram to create engaging content for its followers. Sperry identified fans of the brand on Instagram who were already sharing high-quality photos of its products, and started inviting these users to develop visual content for its official Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPyNJAIgJnd/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7" width="300" height="699" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;7. Samsung: Note 7 Launch&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencer: CyreneQ&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;New smartphones are unveiled everyday. So, when Samsung released its Note 7 in 2016, it set out to make sure people knew about it. The company partnered with CyreneQ, a professional Snapchat artist and designer with a huge subscriber base, to broadcast its launch to a mobile audience that it wanted buying its new product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cyrene used her Snapchat account to document her journey to the event and ultimately give her audience a sneak peak of the new device. Using Snapchat's 10-second video format, she posted clips showing her followers some of the device's new features. See how CyreneQ's Snapchat designs look for the brands she's worked with &lt;a href="https://cyreneq.com/#snapchat"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/cyreneq-snapchat-influencer.jpg" alt="cyreneq-snapchat-influencer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. Diageo: My Tales of Whisky&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencer: Nick Offerman&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Diageo, the parent company of Scottish whiskey brands Lagavulin and Oban, was awarded a &lt;a href="http://shortyawards.com/8th/my-tales-of-whisky-yule-log"&gt;Shorty Award for Best Influencer Marketing Campaign&lt;/a&gt; for this yule log video starring &lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation's&lt;/em&gt; Nick Offerman.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The 44-minute video shows Offerman sitting by a crackling fireplace, staring broodingly into the camera, and occasionally savoring a sip of his drink. Thanks to the simple seasonal premise and Offerman's unique brand, the video was a viral hit.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LS-ErOKpO4E" width="669" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. GAP: Styld.by&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencers: Refinery29, Celebrity Blogs&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;GAP's successful &lt;a href="https://lonelybrand.com/blog/the-gaps-styld-by-campaign-uses-bloggers-to-build-connections/"&gt;Styld.by campaign&lt;/a&gt; featured a number of influential social media personalities from blogging giants like Refinery29 and WhoWhatWhere, showing how they incorporate GAP clothing into their personal wardrobes. Users viewing the influencers' posts on social media were given options to "Shop this Look" conveniently in the caption of photos.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the involvement of multiple influencers from different niches, GAP's campaign had enormous reach.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/gap-styled-by.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=gap-styled-by.png" class="alignCenter shadow" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 600px;" alt="GAP's Styld.by influencer marketing campaign" title="GAP's Styld.by influencer marketing campaign" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. Stride Gum: Mad Intense Gum&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencer: DJ Khaled&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has figured out how to gain a loyal following on Snapchat, it's hip-hop artist and producer DJ Khaled. Once a minor figure in the music world, Khaled has enjoyed an unprecedented level of success on the ephemeral photo-sharing app, with each of his snaps garnering over &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-snapchat-built-a-business/"&gt;3 million views on average&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"DJ Khaled has completely cracked the platform," &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-snapchat-built-a-business/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Emmanuel Seuge, senior vice president for content at Coca-Cola, one of Snapchat’s major advertisers. "He’s the king of Snapchat."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;His "King of Snapchat" status means Khaled is in high-demand for influencer campaigns with brands. He regularly takes part in "Snapchat takeovers," where a brand hands over the reigns of their corporate Snapchat to Khaled for a brief period of largely unfiltered antics.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Working with &lt;a href="http://wklondon.com/2016/07/dj-khaled-fronts-snapchat-takeover-stride-gum/"&gt;W+K London&lt;/a&gt;, Stride Gum launched a Snapchat takeover campaign with Khaled last year to promote its "Mad Intense Gum" campaign. The brand &lt;a href="http://wklondon.com/2016/07/dj-khaled-fronts-snapchat-takeover-stride-gum/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the takeover "an unpredictable, fun day for all his followers."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/%5BAgency_Post%5D/Khaled02-1-640x356.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;name=Khaled02-1-640x356.jpg" class="alignCenter shadow" width="600" style="width: 600px;" alt="Stride Gum's influencer marketing campaign with DJ Khaled" title="Stride Gum's influencer marketing campaign with DJ Khaled"&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. Naked Juice: Sponsored Instagram Posts&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencer: Kate La Vie&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This bottled smoothie brand is edging its way into the beauty, fashion, and health scene on Instagram with help from key influencers in the space. Lifestyle bloggers like Kate La Vie (below) share sponsored posts featuring snapshots of their daily outfits and beauty essentials -- including a strategically placed Naked Juice in the mix.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQvah8oDFoB/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7" width="300" height="609" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;   
&lt;h3&gt;12. Loeffler Randall: LR Ambassadors&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencers: Creative Businesswomen&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;High-end accessory and footwear brand Loeffler Randall has become a favorite among artists, bloggers, and fashion insiders, thanks in big part to the company's commitment to involving social media influencers in its marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The brand's &lt;a href="http://www.loefflerrandall.com/blog/lr-ambassadors-re17/"&gt;"LR Ambassadors"&lt;/a&gt; include a diverse group of writers, painters, florists and other creative businesswomen &lt;a href="http://www.loefflerrandall.com/blog/lr-ambassadors-re17/"&gt;"leading dynamic lives."&lt;/a&gt; In the brand's own words, their LR Ambassadors are &lt;a href="http://www.loefflerrandall.com/blog/"&gt;"cool girls doing cool things."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In addition to profiling its LR Ambassadors on &lt;a href="http://www.loefflerrandall.com/blog/"&gt;the company blog&lt;/a&gt;, Loeffler Randall shares pictures of its ambassadors wearing LR shoes and accessories on Instagram, using the hashtag #LRambassador.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;iframe class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; margin: 1px 1px 12px; max-width: 658px; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: none; display: block; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPS-r7RBbnY/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;amp;v=7" width="300" height="627" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. Glossier: Regular Women&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Influencers: All Women&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This Manhattan-based beauty startup (which was recently named one of Fast Company's &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2017"&gt;Most Innovative Companies of 2017&lt;/a&gt;) owes much of their seemingly overnight cult status to their ever-expanding network of super fans and micro-influencers -- those people who may have high influence, but low individual reach.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying a few big names to promote their minimal skincare and cosmetics, the brand relies on "regular women" to spread the word.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"What's very motivating to us is this idea of every single woman being an influencer," Glossier CEO Emily Weiss &lt;a href="https://qz.com/847460/glossier-girls-emily-weiss-on-how-glossiers-customers-became-its-most-powerful-sales-force/"&gt;told Quartz&lt;/a&gt;. Glossier recently introduced a &lt;a href="https://qz.com/847460/glossier-girls-emily-weiss-on-how-glossiers-customers-became-its-most-powerful-sales-force/"&gt;referral program&lt;/a&gt; to enable its more influential followers to offer product discounts and other incentives to their unique networks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 9 Best Free Email Marketing Tools in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-free-email-marketing-tools</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-free-email-marketing-tools" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/free-email-marketing-tools.jpg" alt="free-email-marketing-tools" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't know, email usage is at an all-time high. More than&lt;a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-email-marketing/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-email-marketing/"&gt;3.7 billion people use email worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't know, email usage is at an all-time high. More than&lt;a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-email-marketing/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/importance-email-marketing/"&gt;3.7 billion people use email worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;With email usage so high, it's no wonder you likely constantly receive marketing emails from businesses. Email marketing works -- even in the B2B space.&lt;a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/06/29/email-marketing-statistics"&gt;86% of B2B marketers&lt;/a&gt; rely on email marketing campaigns to promote new business, which begs the question -- are you using email marketing effectively for your business?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, are you using email marketing consistently &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of email marketing service tools out there to help you with your email marketing, some of which are completely free. But, it's important to note, not all free email marketing tools offer the same features.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As a new business, you're probably most concerned with how many emails you're able to send, which features you have access to, and whether you can upgrade your account as your business grows.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You're probably also thinking about deliverability, and whether your emails will be consistently delivered to your contacts' inboxes. Plus, you likely want a tool that's both easy-to-use and doesn't require advanced technical skills.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have you covered -- here, we've ranked the best free email marketing tools that you can use for your business in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;The 9 Best Free Email Marketing Tools in 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;MailerLite&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email?_ga=2.206700507.911292808.1563807528-1737673942.1546907548"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HubSpot’s Free Email Marketing Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HubSpot offers a reliable and feature-packed email marketing tool that’s suited for growing businesses -- for free. You can create professional marketing emails that engage and grow your audience with the easy drag-and-drop email builder. With the drag-and-drop email builder, you don't need to wait on IT or designers for help. Instead, you can easily create beautiful emails that your audience will love. HubSpot's tool helps you achieve incredible marketing results with little effort.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On top of the free email tool, you can use the HubSpot CRM for free to create tailored touch-points for your customers. HubSpot email is automatically connected with the HubSpot CRM, so you can tailor relevant emails based on any details you have -- such as form submissions and website activity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using the CRM, you can include personalized content in your emails, like first name and company name, to ensure your contacts feel like they are being personally addressed, all while tracking email activity in the CRM. This contributes to efficient scaling opportunities should your business outgrow the free tools and require more robust automation features, such as workflows.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing your emails has never been easier. Using the tool's email reporting analytics, you’ll learn how to send more relevant and optimized emails to your audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The HubSpot email tool is free for up to 2,000 email sends per month, with upgrade solutions starting at $50 with Marketing Hub Starter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sendpulse.com/"&gt;Send Pulse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Send Pulse has over 130+ templates to choose from, or you can create your own using drag-and-drop functionality. Under the free plan, you'll have access to Send Pulse's highly regarded support team, including support via live chat.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In terms of functionality, Send Pulse has a "Resend" feature that allows you to resend unopened emails with different subject lines, which is valuable for time scrapped marketers. What's great about Send Pulse is that it has prices for all its services. For example, if you need to send SMS, you can add an SMS package to your email marketing service package.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They also offer web pushes, SMTP, Viber, and more. Since the service started in 2015, there still isn't a ton of API support, but that's something Send Pulse is working on improving for marketers who are in need of technical functionality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;SendPulse offers 15,000 emails per month for free for up to 2,500 subscribers. Pricing starts at $9.85 per month for unlimited emails and up to 2,500 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://mailchimp.com/"&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;MailChimp's email tool is particularly useful for small and medium-sized businesses, since the free plan offers up to 12,000 email sends per month for up to 2,000 subscribers. Plus, you get access to features such as list segmentation, A/B testing, contact profiles and more. However, it's important to note you'll have MailChimp branding in your email footers with the free plan, and won't have access to premium support.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you use e-commerce software, you'll be happy to know that MailChimp integrates with e-commerce providers including WooCommerce and Magento. You'll also be able to integrate Mailchimp with Wordpress if your business uses WordPress as its content management system. MailChimp offers reporting for emails, but the details may not be as robust as you would like for optimal improvements.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The MailChimp Free Forever plan allows up to 12,000 email sends per month to a subscriber limit of 2,000. The next tier upgrade tier costs $10 per month for unlimited email sends to a maximum of 500 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/campaigns/"&gt;Zoho Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Zoho Campaigns is a good option for small to enterprise-sized businesses, depending on how quickly you're scaling. With the Zoho Campaigns free plan, you get access to features such as A/B testing, reports, and templates. If you're already using the Zoho CRM, it makes sense to check out Zoho campaigns to see how email and the CRM work together.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note -- while the free version provides a lot of features, most of these features have limitations. Additionally, it can be difficult to get started using Zoho Campaigns because it requires customization before sending emails.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Zoho offers 12,000 emails per month for up to 2,000 subscribers. Pricing starts at $5 per month for up to 500 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/campaigns/email-marketing/features.html"&gt;Zoho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://moosend.com/"&gt;Moosend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Moosend is ideal for people looking to get their feet wet in email marketing. The free tier comes feature-packed, but you're maxed at 1,000 subscribers and won't have a dedicated IP address.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Moosend offers an easy to use drag-and-drop editor, email marketing automation triggers, real-time analytics, and list segmentation features. Moosend doesn't offer a CRM, but if you're looking to solely do email marketing, it might be a good start for your business.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The company is ranked as having great support and satisfaction scores. If you're a growing business, you'll only need to pay for subscribers. The next upgrade is $10, and you'll get up to 2,000 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%209%20Best%20Free%20Email%20Marketing%20Tools%20in%202019.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="https://moosend.com/"&gt;Moosend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.sendinblue.com/"&gt;SendInBlue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your business relies heavily on transactional emails, such as forgotten password help and invoice receipts, then SendInBlue might be ideal for you. With their extensive developer APIs, you'll be able to integrate with their email system to achieve custom and required technical processes. Plus, while the service was initially known for having issues with delivery rates, SendInBlue has since improved upon its deliverability.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With SendInBlue's free plan, you'll have access to a vast array of templates, personalization, A/B testing, contact management, workflow editor, and real-time reporting. Like the other tools mentioned, the software is easy to use, although the main interface can sometimes offer too many options and feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;SendInBlue offers up to 300 email sends per day (which is roughly 9,000 emails/month) for free with unlimited contacts. Upgrade solutions start at $25/month for 40,000 emails and no daily sending limit.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%206.25.43%20PM.png?width=1390&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-04-12%20at%206.25.43%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-12 at 6.25.43 PM" width="1390" style="width: 1390px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="https://www.sendinblue.com/features/"&gt;SendInBlue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.mailjet.com/"&gt;Mailjet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With Mailjet's free plan, you'll have access to unlimited contacts, APIs and webhooks, an advanced email editor, and advanced statistics. However, you won't have access to A/B testing or automation features. The Mailjet interface is also simple to use, so you won't have to spend a ton of time getting familiar with the service. Since you get full API access as part of the free plan, Mailjet is suited for businesses that require technical adjustments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Mailjet's free plan offers up to 200 emails per day (that's roughly 6,000 emails per month). You can upgrade starting at $8.69 per month for 30,000 emails and no daily sending limit.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href="https://www.mailjet.com/email-marketing/"&gt;Mailjet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.benchmarkemail.com/"&gt;Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you work for a business that is experiencing incredible growth, yet isn't already using an email marketing service, you might want to check out Benchmark's free email tool. The tool is well-equipped with premium features, and designed to cater to the enterprise-level business.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the free version of Benchmark, you can use the drag-and-drop editor, select from various templates, use sign-up forms, build basic drip campaigns, and use the list hygiene feature. Benchmark is user-friendly and easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, there's no option for A/B testing or automation features on the free tool. Furthermore, contacts can't be added via list import in the free plan. You can only email contacts who fill out Benchmark subscriber forms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark offers a free Starter Plan with up to 2,000 subscribers and 14,000 emails per month. The next upgrade plan starts at $13.99 for up to 600 subscribers and unlimited email sends per month.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%209%20Best%20Free%20Email%20Marketing%20Tools%20in%202019-5.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="https://www.benchmarkemail.com/features/emaildesigner"&gt;Benchmark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/"&gt;MailerLite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although it has "lite" in the name, MailerLite is actually a good solution for businesses starting out and looking to grow. The service is ideal for small businesses needing to send bulk marketing emails. It's also well equipped with preview features so you can preview your email on desktop and mobile before sending it. However, the API and integration capabilities are not as robust as some of the other options in this list.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Mailerlite offers 12,000 emails per month with up to 1,000 subscribers. The next upgrade tier costs $10, and it unlocks all features for up to 1,000 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%209%20Best%20Free%20Email%20Marketing%20Tools%20in%202019-2.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/"&gt;Mailerlite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://expresspigeon.com/"&gt;ExpressPigeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ExpressPigeon provides a good solution for businesses using small list sizes but sending to very high-priority subscribers. With ExpressPigeon, you can effortlessly build and personalize emails, automate email responses, and send high volume emails.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, you get access to all of the premium features with the free plan -- however, there are low send and subscriber limits. ExpressPigeon is regarded as having some of the best customer satisfaction scores in the industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ExpressPigeon offers a free plan that allows 1,000 messages for up to 500 subscribers, and one user only. The price of each additional user is $100 per month. The next upgrade tier is a huge price jump: $1,000 per month for up to 100,000 subscribers and two million emails.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image source: &lt;a href="https://expresspigeon.com/editor"&gt;ExpressPigeon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now, you have a better sense of the best free email marketing tools at your disposal. Fortunately, you don't need to commit to any service. You can try these tools out depending on your business' needs, then select the one most ideal for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to get started building incredible email marketing campaigns, we recommend that you try &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.86680536.152992570.1563201254-1410611167.1533048207"&gt;HubSpot's Free CRM&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>24 of the Best Email Subject Lines We've Ever Seen</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-subject-lines-list</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-subject-lines-list" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/best-email-subject-lines.jpg" alt="best-email-subject-lines" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;I'd venture to guess you get tons of emails in your inbox every day.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From coupons, to daily deal sites, to newsletters, to password resets, to your mother wanting to know when you plan to visit -- it's a lot to sift through, never mind actually open&lt;em style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I'd venture to guess you get tons of emails in your inbox every day.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From coupons, to daily deal sites, to newsletters, to password resets, to your mother wanting to know when you plan to visit -- it's a lot to sift through, never mind actually open&lt;em style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;So what makes you want to take that extra step to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; open an email? Often, it's the subject line. After all, it's your very first impression of the email -- and from it, you'll do your best to judge the content on the inside.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're an email marketer, or just someone who happens to send emails on behalf of your company, you don't want to be one of those ignored (or -- gasp -- &lt;em&gt;deleted)&lt;/em&gt; emails in your subscribers' inboxes. You've got to make sure your email subject lines are top-notch -- and what better way to learn how to do that than by examining some great examples of subject lines?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at what makes a great subject line, followed by a few examples that, old or new, we're crazy about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(While you're at it, check out our new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ooogenerator.com/"&gt;Out-of-Office Email Generator&lt;/a&gt; to make your email address even more delightful to your contacts.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-hiring-summer-19?utm_source=blog"&gt;P.S.: &lt;span&gt;Think you have what it takes to join the HubSpot Marketing Team? (We do!) Apply now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. "Uh-oh, your prescription is expiring"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Warby Parker&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, a HubSpot alum received this email two weeks before he needed to renew his prescription -- talk about great timing. And when you're eye prescription is expiring, it happens to be an excellent time to upgrade your glasses. By sending an email at the right time, Warby Parker increased its chances of this email getting opened.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But timing isn't the sole reason we included this example. This subject is brilliant because it appeared at the right time and &lt;em&gt;with the right tone.&lt;/em&gt; Using conversational words like "uh-oh," keeping the subject line sentence case, and leaving out the period at the end, the subject line comes across as helpful and friendly -- not as a company trying to upsell you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. "Best of Groupon: The Deals That Make Us Proud (Unlike Our Nephew, Steve)"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Groupon&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to be funny in your marketing, but Groupon's one of those brands that seems to nail it again and again. After all, who can for get this classic unsubscribe video?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/to5znws7mvU" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This subject line is no exception. The quip, "(Unlike Our Nephew Steve)," actually had us laughing out loud. Why? It's completely unexpected. The first part of the subject line looks like a typical subject line you'd get from Groupon, highlighting a new deal. The parenthetical content? Not so much -- making this one a delightful gem to find in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. "&#x1f457; Free (Cool!) Clothes Alert &#x1f456;"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Clover&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we have a not-so-secret love for emojis in email subject lines. Personally, I'm partial to turquoise -- so when I see an email implying that I might somehow be able to obtain a free turquoise dress, chances are, I'm clicking.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That's part of what makes this subject line work. It draws the recipients eye by using &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;visual content&lt;/a&gt; (emojis), and it hints at an offer of something free. That hints at an incentive to open the email: There's a something to gain inside.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. "The timer’s going off on your cart!"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: King Arthur Flour&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Warby Parker, this subject line makes use of urgency. If I don't take action on my King Arthur Flour shopping cart -- like actually buying them -- it will be cleared, and I'll have to start all over again.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe this is a low-risk scenario. But when it comes to my baking goods, personally, I don't like to take any chances, or risk forgetting what I was going to buy. That's where the personalization aspect of this subject line comes in: King Arthur Flour -- especially its online shop -- tends to attract both professional and home bakers who take all things culinary a bit more seriously than, say, someone who only buys flour on occasion from the supermarket. And wouldn't you know? Those are the same bakers who probably don't want to spend time building their shopping carts from scratch.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story: Know your audience when you're writing email subject lines. Is there something that they take seriously more than others? If so, incorporate that into your copy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. "What Did You Think? Write a Review."&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: REI&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I received an email with this subject line about a week after buying a portable stove at REI for a camping trip I was going on. I had just gotten back from that trip, too. It was perfect timing for them to ask me what I thought of it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Companies ask satisfied customers to write reviews of their business all the time. But when you specifically send these requests to the people who &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; purchased something from you, you're being smart with your mailing list &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; reaching recipients whose interest is still warm.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another reason this subject line works? It's not expecting a good review. REI is genuinely asking me what I thought of the stove I bought. Maybe I hated it (I didn't) ... the company just wanted me to speak up.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. "Important Weather Advisory"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: RCN&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Any time we see a weather-related alert, our ears perk up. In RCN's case, it isn't just a way to lure recipients into opening an email. The subject line above is RCN's way of updating its customers to potential power outages and driving attention to the brand that provides them with cable and Wi-Fi -- even during inclement weather.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you can hitch your &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email"&gt;email marketing&lt;/a&gt; campaign to an event you know people pay attention to, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have something helpful to offer in response, you'll see your email open rate soar.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. "1,750 points for you. Valentine's flowers &amp;amp; more for them."&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: JetBlue&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's such a specific number ... 1,750 ... of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; you're going to open this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Coming from an airline, an offering of "points" might as well be gold to someone who likes to travel. And if that recipient also has a significant other, sending this email leading up to Valentine's Day is a home run.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The best part about the subject line above is how particular JetBlue was about the number of points available. Instead of, say, "20% your next return flight of 1,000 miles or more," this subject line gives it to you straight: 1,750 points, and all you have to do is buy flowers for your loved one. You're already wondering how far you can fly with 1,750 points, I can tell.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. "Rock the color of the year"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Etsy&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In six words, Etsy was able to promote a product solely by its color, and inform you that there is apparently a "color of the year." The email is truly too intriguing not to open.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Etsy is an ecommerce website for user-created marketplaces, and the reason we were impressed by its subject line above was because of the way it uses mystery to drive value into a suite of products. This email isn't an invitation to buy clothing or jewelry; it's an invitation to find out what the color of the year is.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: It was "ultra violet."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. "Black Friday shoppers are the worst customers"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: LinkedIn&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This subject line is likely the boldest of the Black Friday emails you'd see in your inbox in the days before Thanksgiving. Yes, it's a bit judgmental, but it actually came in a LinkedIn Pulse newsletter, promoting an article one of its users wrote on the topic of holiday marketing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And there's no doubt the title resonates with how some people feel during the most hectic holiday shopping day of the year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn has nothing to sell on Black Friday, so the subject line above does little harm to its business. Nonetheless, commenting on a popular cultural observation, however facetious, can show your confidence and help you relate to your community.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. "*Don't Open This Email*"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Manicube&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ever been told to not do something? Being asked to refrain from something can actually have the opposite effect -- you now want to do that thing even more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That's the strategy behind Manicube's subject line. It's a simple but effective way to make people curious enough to open your email. (Just be sure that the contents of your email actually have something worthy of that subject line.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. "I got Botox—&amp;amp; THIS is what it looked like"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Refinery29&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so maybe your business doesn't involve Botox. But still -- are you intrigued? I am, and despite my better judgment, I clicked.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That's the power of leading your emails with a story: It sparks curiosity, which works in two ways. There are times when our natural curiosity can pique our interest without context, such as in the example above. But in this case, the subject line implies that there's an intriguing story ahead. Why the heck did this person get Botox? And what &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; it look like? As the saying goes, "Inquiring minds want to know."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think of the stories behind your industry, and then, find ways to include them in email newsletters and frame them within the subject line in a way that piques your recipients' collective curiosity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. Zillow: "What Can You Afford?"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Zillow&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Imagine getting this subject line in your inbox from a website showing apartments for rent. It's both exciting and encouraging ("Here are a bunch of apartments &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; in your budget. Yay!"), but also kind of competitive -- pitting your cash against what the market offers. Would you click it? I certainly would.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Personalizing emails to cater to your audience's emotions -- for which there's a broad spectrum, when it comes to real estate -- is key to getting people to open your emails. You don't have to be a psychologist to know how to take advantage of them, either. In addition to principles like urgency, crafting an email subject line that implies scarcity is another great way to increase your conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. "As You Wish"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: UncommonGoods&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When writing emails, you should also think about the recognizable names and reference that make people tick. For example, take this subject line from UncommonGoods forwarded to us from HubSpot's Content Director, Corey Wainwright, who happens to be a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/corey_bos"&gt;die-hard fan of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, "As You Wish" is a pretty big reference to that movie (I know, I know -- I need to watch it again), so when she saw this subject line in her inbox, she just HAD to click.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even though she knew logically that the email was part of a larger-scale send, it almost seemed like it was tailored to be sent personally to her -- after all, why else would it include a reference to &lt;em&gt;Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt; in the title?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;UncommonGoods knows its &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas"&gt;buyer persona&lt;/a&gt; like the back of its metaphorical hand. While it may not send emails to individual subscribers with references to their favorite movies in the title, it does have a general understanding of its subscribers and their interests.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;14. "Google sees smartphone heroics in Oreo. It's The Daily Crunch."&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: TechCrunch&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're subscribed to a newsletter from a publication like &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, chances are, you signed up because you're either interested in or want to learn more about technology. To reflect that, the media outlet crafts its daily email roundups ("The Daily Crunch") with a subject line that reflects one of the latest, most compelling news items in the industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: Staying on the cutting edge is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, especially with something that evolves as quickly as technology. So by writing email subject lines that reflect something that's recent and relevant, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; is signaling to email recipients that opening the message will help them stay informed and up-to-date on the latest industry news.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about the things that your audience struggles to keep up with -- then, craft an email roundup and matching subject line that reflects the latest news in that category.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;15. "Where to Drink Beer Right Now"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Eater Boston&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Okay, you caught me: I'm a beer lover. (One of the many reasons I like &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/jobs"&gt;working at HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;.) But that's not what hooked me here. The subject line arrived in my inbox just at the time I needed it: &lt;strong&gt;at 6:45 on a Wednesday evening&lt;/strong&gt;. Absolutely. Genius.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: You're just over hump day and want to decompress with a few coworkers after work. Right as you're about to head out, you get a notification on your phone that says, "Where to Drink Beer Right Now." Perfect timing makes this subject line something you can't help but click on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For your own emails, think about how timing will affect how people perceive your emails. Even if you send an email in an off-peak hour, you could get higher engagement on your email -- &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you have the right subject line.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;16. "Not Cool, Guys"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: BuzzFeed&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Okay, we admit it: We love BuzzFeed. If nothing else, its staff knows how to write great copy -- and that sentiment includes an exceptional email marketing team. Many of my colleagues have signed up for BuzzFeed's daily emails, and pretty much any day of the week, they win for best subject line in their inboxes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few of BuzzFeed's subject lines here and there that aren't anything to write home about, it's the combination of subject lines and the preview text that is golden. They're friendly, conversational, and, above all, snarky.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's the text that followed the subject line above: "Okay, WHO left the passive-aggressive sticky note on my fridge. Honestly, who acts like this?" That conversational tone and snark pull us in over and over again -- and it's the preview text that completes the experience for me.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We're not all equipped to be snarky writers, but most email platforms have the preview text easily available to edit. How can you use that little extra space to delight your customers (oh, and probably improve your email stats)? Maybe you could use the subject line as a question, and the preview text area as the answer. Or maybe it's a dialogue: The subject line is one person, and the preview text is another.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You get the idea. By using that space, you have more opportunities to attract new subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;17. "DO NOT Commit These Instagram Atrocities"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Thrillist&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No matter how humble people are, most don't like to do things wrong ... so why not play on that natural human tendency in an email subject line, especially if you're in the business of helping clients (or prospective clients) succeed? Thrillist certainly does in the subject line above, and it makes the language even more vibrant by using DO NOT -- a great takeaway for B2B marketers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using the typical contraction "don't," Thrillist spells it out and adds the all-caps for effect. That way, you'll notice the subject line in your inbox, and then not, finder it harder to resist clicking on it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about how going negative in your marketing might be a good thing. For example, many of us have anxiety about looking silly and stupid, so figure out how you can play to those emotions in subject lines. Of course, it's important to back up that subject line with encouraging, helpful content, so that you're not just ranting at people all day.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Getting negative can get your subscribers' attention -- this subject line certainly caught mine.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;18. "Buffer has been hacked - here is what's going on"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Buffer&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Next is a subject line from Buffer. Back in 2013, &lt;a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-has-been-hacked-here-is-whats-going-on/"&gt;Buffer got hacked&lt;/a&gt; -- every tech company's worst nightmare. But Buffer handled it exceptionally well, especially on the email front.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What we admire about the subject line is that it's concise and direct. In a crisis, it's better to steer clear of puns. People want to see that you're not only taking the situation seriously, but also be reassured that the world isn't ending.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because of the way the subject line is worded and formatted, you feel like Buffer is calm and collected about the issue, and is taking your personal safety into consideration. That's pretty hard to do in just a few words.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;19. "Everything you wanted to know about email copy but were too afraid to ask"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Copy Hackers&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's another great example of leveraging your audience's full plate to your email marketing advantage. Who hasn't refrained from asking a question out of fear of looking silly or out of the loop? Excuse me, while I sheepishly raise my hand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;" ... but were too afraid to ask" is one of those phrases that, to us, probably won't go out of style for a long time. People seek insights from Copy Hackers -- an organization dedicated to helping marketers and other professionals write better copy, as the name suggests -- because, well, they have questions. They want to improve. And when that audience is too afraid to ask those questions, here's Copy Hackers, ready to come to the rescue with answers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What does your audience want to know, but might be too embarrassed to ask? Use that information to craft your content -- including your email subject lines.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;20. "&#x1f436; Want a Custom Emoji of Tullamore &amp;amp; 6 Months FREE Walks? Book a Walk Today for Your Chance to Win!"&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Wag!&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For reference, Tullamore is the name of my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandazantalwiener/"&gt;Amanda Zantal-Wiener&lt;/a&gt;'s dog. And the subject line she received, written above, is another winning example of perfect emoji placement -- especially when it's a cute dog.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's a great example of how personalization goes beyond the email recipient's name. Wag!, an on-demand dog-walking app, includes the names of its customers' pets in a portion of its email subject lines. But this type of personalization is more than just a first-name basis. If there's anything my colleague Amanda loves more than free stuff and baking goods, it's her pup. Wag! knows that, and by mentioning Tullamore by name in the subject line -- in tandem with an offer, no less -- it caught her attention and piques her interest.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;21. "Abra-cord-abra! Yeah, we said it."&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: Quircky&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is this punny email subject line from Quirky. Yes -- we're suckers for puns, in the right situation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What we like most about it is the second part: "Yeah, we said it." The pun in the beginning is great and all -- it refers to a new invention featured on Quirky's site to help everyday consumers detangle their numerous plugs and cords -- but the second sentence is conversational and self-referential. That's exactly what many of us would say after making a really cheesy joke in real life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many brands could stand to be more conversational and goofy in their emails. While it may not be appropriate to go as far as Quirky's subject line, being goofy might just be the way to delight your email recipients.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;22. "&lt;span&gt;China Falls, Sleepy Unicorns, And The Deals Aren’t Bigger In Texas"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sender: Crunchbase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Crunchbase Insights email has an interesting way of wrapping details about all the stories it will present you in one subject line. This is eye-catching because it seems like an odd mashup of words, but gets to the point about three complicated stories at the same time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to email, Crunchbase is known for their longer, text based emails. They all read like a more conversational letter to a the email recipient and casually discuss and hyperlink Crunchbase's top stories.&amp;nbsp; While the subject lines feel interesting and eye-catching, the emails often report deeper business news that cut right to the chase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Crunchbase%20News%20email.jpg?width=956&amp;amp;name=Crunchbase%20News%20email.jpg" alt="Crunchbase News email with subject line of &amp;quot;China Falls, Sleepy Unicorns, And The Deals Aren’t Bigger In Texas&amp;quot;" width="956" style="width: 956px;"&gt;This subject line shows how you can be punchy, but also fun and creative when trying to pull in your audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;23. "&lt;span&gt;&#x1f525; Hot freebie alert! 15 free gifts, you pick 5."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sender: Shutterfly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shutterfly, a company that allows you to print your photos on interesting products or other frames gets visual with their subject lines by occasionally using an emoji. Due to their company's nature and creative audience, the fire emoji in this subject line seems to work without feeling desperate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The email subject line also pops because it has a lot of buzzwords, including "hot," "freebie," "gifts," and "alert." In just once line, it is able to give the potential reader a good reason to open it, especially if they love using Shutterfly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you open the email, it aligns perfectly with the subject line by announcing a freebie promotion. This strong alignment between the subject line and message might keep people from just skimming the message.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Shutterfly%20Freebie%20Email.jpg?width=793&amp;amp;name=Shutterfly%20Freebie%20Email.jpg" alt="Shutterfly Freebie Email with subject line of &amp;quot;Hot freebie alert! 15 free gifts, you pick 5.&amp;quot;" width="793" style="width: 793px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;24. "Watch Out for This Amazon Phishing Scam."&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Sender: WIRED&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this subject line, WIRED includes Amazon, a large company name. Including the name of a big brand can be a great way to boost open rates because people who enjoy or use products from a big brands might click into a subject line that discusses them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when a brand name is combined with negative words like "phishing" or "scam," people might open the email much more urgently so they can learn how to avoid running into the issue being discussed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While Shutterfly's message has strong alignment with its subject line, WIRED oppositely gives a subject line related to &lt;a href="https://links.newsletters.wired.com/servlet/MailView?ms=MTU5NTUyMzAS1&amp;amp;r=MzI4ODA4NzA3MTY5S0&amp;amp;j=MTY4MDg1NDcwNgS2&amp;amp;mt=1&amp;amp;rt=0"&gt;the last story in its newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. This is an interesting way to get your readers to scroll through the entire email and see the other stories before they get to the story that lead them to click into it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Wired%20Email%20Newsletter.jpg?width=906&amp;amp;name=Wired%20Email%20Newsletter.jpg" alt=" Wired Email Newsletter with subject line of &amp;quot;Watch Out for this Amazon Phishing Scam.&amp;quot;" width="906" style="width: 906px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Micro-Influencer Marketing: A Comprehensive Guide</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/micro-influencer-marketing</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/micro-influencer-marketing" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Micro-influencer-marketing.jpg" alt="Micro-influencer-marketing" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Has a celebrity ever convinced you to buy something?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s okay if the answer is yes -- we’ve all been there. In fact, just recently, a famous dog helped convince me to purchase a GoPro camera. For a creature who can’t speak, he’s a pretty&amp;nbsp;effective marketer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Has a celebrity ever convinced you to buy something?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s okay if the answer is yes -- we’ve all been there. In fact, just recently, a famous dog helped convince me to purchase a GoPro camera. For a creature who can’t speak, he’s a pretty&amp;nbsp;effective marketer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Loki the Wolfdog’s &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPgEslugjMk/?taken-by=loki_the_wolfdog"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; is a successful example of &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/guide-influencer-marketing?source=hubspot-blog-two&amp;amp;utm_campaign=EMEA%20Offers%20-%20The%20Content%20Marketer%27s%20Guide%20to%20Influencer%20Marketing&amp;amp;utm_source=HS%20Blog%20Two"&gt;influencer marketing&lt;/a&gt;, which involves developing relationships with influential personalities to promote your brand to the influencer’s audience. Loki the Wolfdog has over 1 million Instagram followers GoPro may not have otherwise been able to reach with posts on its own profile.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A newer concept known as &lt;strong&gt;micro-influencer&lt;/strong&gt; marketing recently joined the social media scene. It’s the same concept as influencer marketing, but on a smaller scale: Brands partner with individuals with smaller followings on social media to promote products with authentic, visual posts instead of sponsored ads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we’ll tell you everything you need to know about micro-influencers, including what brands are using them successfully and how you can connect with these individuals to promote your brand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Micro-influencers are social media users unlike typical celebrities, experts, or public figures. They're individuals who work or specialize in a particular vertical and frequently share social media content about their interests. Unlike traditional "influencers," micro-influencers have a more modest number of followers -- typically in the thousands or tens of thousands -- but they boast hyper-engaged audiences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, a yoga influencer might boast millions of followers and operate several yoga studios. A yoga micro-influencer might have only a few thousand&amp;nbsp;followers and post instructional videos on Instagram for their fans to try at home, but their average post receives a healthy amount of engagement relative to the size of their follower base.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Influencer vs. Micro-Influencer&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Influencer marketing is when organizations partner with top content creators -- people with thousands or even millions of followers -- to promote their products or services to the content creator's audience. When brands partner with influencers, companies are able to leverage the established trust amongst the influencer's audience. Consumers are more likely to buy from someone they know and trust, so influencers are extremely effective when it comes to strategies like word-of-mouth marketing or increasing social proof. Brands will often pay influencers to either post content featuring their products or sponsor their events, capturing the influencers' large reach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of influencer marketing is the partnership between Diageo, parent company of Scottish whiskey brands Lagavulin and Oban, and actor Nick Offerman. Best known for his role as a gruff, hyper-masculine government official on &lt;i&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/i&gt;, Offerman appears in a &lt;a href="/marketing/examples-of-influencer-marketing-campaigns?_ga=2.95753756.1692201945.1563204441-527251855.1560789477"&gt;45-minute parody video&lt;/a&gt; drinking a Lagavulin single malt whisky next to a traditional holiday Yule Log. The video went viral and won multiple awards, rocketing an older brand into one cultural relevance.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Micro-influencers, on the other hand, have a more moderate backing -- compared to influencers, mico-influencers usually have fewer than 100,000 followers. However, the rate of audience&lt;a href="http://markerly.com/blog/instagram-marketing-does-influencer-size-matter/"&gt; engagement on content peaks around 1,000 followers&lt;/a&gt;, making a partnership with a micro-influencer incredibly valuable to companies looking to increase brand awareness. Micro-influencers generate a ton of content that appeals to their audiences and become well-established in their area of interest. Over&lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers?_ga=2.95753756.1692201945.1563204441-527251855.1560789477"&gt; 82% of surveyed consumers&lt;/a&gt; said they were likely to buy something a micro-influencer recommended. Companies can partner with micro-influencers to write a post about a product offer, publish a review, or share the product with their social communities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Value of Micro-Influencers&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using micro-influencers may seem counterintuitive. Why would you seek out someone with a &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; following to promote your brand?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons to believe micro-influencers might get better results for your brand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Micro-influencers have better engagement rates.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://markerly.com/blog/instagram-marketing-does-influencer-size-matter/"&gt;Markerly&lt;/a&gt; studied Instagram engagement and found a surprising trend: As an influencer's number of followers increases, their number of likes and comments from followers decreases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In its analysis, &lt;a href="http://markerly.com/blog/instagram-marketing-does-influencer-size-matter/"&gt;Markerly determined&lt;/a&gt; the following:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Instagram users with fewer than 1,000 followers generated likes 8% of the time&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Users with 1,000-10,000 followers earned likes at a 4% rate&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Users with 10,000-100,000 followers achieved a 2.4% like rate&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Users with 1-10 million followers earned likes only 1.7% of the time.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Check out Markerly's&amp;nbsp;graphical breakdown of&amp;nbsp;how likes and comments decline as followers increase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://markerly.com/blog/instagram-marketing-does-influencer-size-matter/"&gt;Markerly recommends&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;brands pursue micro-influencers with Instagram followings in the 1,000-10,000 range. With micro-influencers, brands can achieve higher engagement rates among&amp;nbsp;a large enough audience. In a recent study, &lt;a href="https://business.experticity.com/new-research-shows-micro-influencers-drive-consumer-buying-behavior-much-higher-rates-previously-thought/"&gt;Experticity&lt;/a&gt; learned micro-influencers have 22.2X more conversations than the typical Instagram users -- largely because they're passionate and knowledgeable about their particular interest area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Micro-influencers have more targeted audiences.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Markerly also notes that micro-influencers have &lt;a href="http://markerly.com/blog/instagram-marketing-does-influencer-size-matter/"&gt;more targeted follower bases&lt;/a&gt; than influencers with follower numbers in the hundreds of thousands and millions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: If a clothing brand partnered with a celebrity with millions of followers on Instagram, the celebrity could reach their huge pool, but a large portion of them might not be interested in fashion. Instead, if the clothing brand connected with 100 fashion bloggers with 1,000 followers apiece, it would be able to connect to a smaller but far more targeted and engaged audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Markerly CEO and co-founder Sarah Ware &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/agencies/micro-influencers/"&gt;told Digiday&lt;/a&gt; that partnering with the Kardashian and Jenner sisters to promote a weight-loss tea on Instagram led to a significant number&amp;nbsp;of conversions. However, Ware also noted that working with 30-40 micro-influencers achieved a higher conversion rate than when the celebrities were promoting the tea. In fact, 82% of customers surveyed by &lt;a href="https://business.experticity.com/new-research-shows-micro-influencers-drive-consumer-buying-behavior-much-higher-rates-previously-thought/"&gt;Experticity&lt;/a&gt; said they would be very likely to follow a recommendation from a micro-influencer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Micro-influencers are more affordable.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Micro-influencers are typically &lt;a href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/micro-macro-influencer-marketing-kim-kardashian/307118/"&gt;more affordable&lt;/a&gt; than celebrities or profiles with millions of followers. Celebrities sometimes charge &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/business/media/instagram-ads-marketing-kardashian.html"&gt;up to $75,00&lt;/a&gt; for a single Instagram post promoting a product. In contrast, &lt;a href="http://wersm.com/micro-influencer-marketing-cost/"&gt;97% of micro-influencers&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram charge less than $500 for a promotion post. Granted, brands usually work with more than one micro-influencer to maximize reach, but even 100 micro-influencers would cost less than a single celebrity on Instagram at these rates.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For micro-influencers with smaller followings, brands may even be able to compensate them in the form of free products. &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/brands/the-lacroix-guide-micro-influencers/"&gt;According to Digiday&lt;/a&gt;, La Croix Sparkling Water (more on them below) sent a micro-influencer vouchers for free products instead.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Micro-influencers are more authentic.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Micro-influencers are real people, so their Instagram content is real, too. Instagram users with a few thousand followers likely post their own content, reply to comments, and behave more authentically than a brand or a celebrity with a social media manager might. If a micro-influencer engages with a promotional post on Instagram, their followers might be more inclined to click to learn more about the brand they're posting about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that &lt;a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/141107034797/160315-news"&gt;Instagram recently changed its algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to mirror Facebook's. Now, posts from profiles users follow and interact with are shown first in Instagram feeds, and authentic, quality content is&amp;nbsp;prioritized over promoted content from big brands. This might make micro-influencer content more visible than content from celebrities if the algorithm determines users might be more interested in it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One note: If you were wondering why we’re only mentioning Instagram in this blog post, it's because micro-influencers as a marketing strategy has taken off primarily on that platform. Because Instagram is so visual, it's easy for micro-influencers to post photos of products and brand experiences instead of writing a promotional tweet or Facebook post. That's not to say that micro-influencer marketing can't be done on other social media platforms, but Instagram's Explore tab helps users find and interact with micro-influencer content easily.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You'll see what we mean when we dive into different micro-influencer strategies brands are using successfully below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;4 Brands Using Micro-Influencers Successfully&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1) La Croix Sparkling Water&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;La Croix Sparkling Water started &lt;a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/141107034797/160315-news"&gt;tapping into micro-influencers&lt;/a&gt; to promote its brand in a competitive marketplace. It relies primarily on &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lacroix-bubbles-up-in-sparkling-water-brand-competition-1460047940"&gt;social media marketing&lt;/a&gt; to get discovered, especially by millennials.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;La Croix identifies micro-influencers on Instagram and asks&amp;nbsp;them to share &lt;strong&gt;product awareness &lt;/strong&gt;posts on Instagram. It finds micro-influencers by searching branded hashtags, such as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/livelacroix/"&gt;#LiveLaCroix&lt;/a&gt;, and when users tag the brand on Instagram. It&amp;nbsp;specifically targets profiles with lower follower counts to maintain a feeling of authentic "realness" that appeals to millennial Instagram users. Then, La Croix&amp;nbsp;reaches out to them with product vouchers or other offers to post pictures with the sparkling water.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you check out &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lacroixwater/"&gt;La Croix's Instagram page&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see it features&amp;nbsp;a lot of content posted by micro-influencers, such as&amp;nbsp;this photo below:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt; 
 &lt;div style="padding: 8px;"&gt; 
  &lt;div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 62.4537037037037% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"&gt;
   &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQGvkaODanr/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;Lending a hydrating, helping hand. ☺️(&#x1f4f8;:@charleyraee)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A photo posted by LaCroix Sparkling Water (@lacroixwater) on Feb 4, 2017 at 1:49pm PST&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;By tapping into smaller, more targeted networks of micro-influencers, La Croix cultivates a social media presence that's authentic and fun, and ensures its product is in front of the eyes of similar users. If you have a physical product that looks great on camera (like an eye-popping can of La Croix), try engaging with micro-influencers by sending free product for &lt;strong&gt;Instagram promotions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2) Kimpton Hotels&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Boutique hotel chain Kimpton uses &lt;strong&gt;Instagram takeovers&lt;/strong&gt; to connect with micro-influencers. These consist of micro-influencers creating original content for the brand's Instagram and posting the content as themselves. Takeovers connect new audiences with the brand and help generate new followers, more engagement, and eventually, new potential guests at Kimpton Hotels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.curalate.com/blog/micro-influencer-brand-marketing/"&gt;Curalate&lt;/a&gt; Marketing Director &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/BrendanLowry/"&gt;Brendan Lowry&lt;/a&gt; wrote about taking over some of Kimpton's Instagram accounts and posting photos of his own, like this one:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt; 
 &lt;div style="padding: 8px;"&gt; 
  &lt;div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 42.4537037037037% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"&gt;
   &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BFumB5OB0B7/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;I couldn't leave town without seeing this view. Thanks for following along during my takeover, y'all. Hopefully you enjoyed the photos -- I had a blast taking them. Until next time... &#x1f44b;&#x1f44b;&#x1f44b;. -- This is Part 11 of an Instagram takeover by photographer @BrendanLowry. -- #IGBoston #Kimpton #KimptonHotels #KimptonLove #IGersBoston #VisitBoston #VacationBoston #BostonPublicLibrary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A photo posted by kimptoninbos (@kimptoninbos) on May 22, 2016 at 4:30pm PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;The caption links easily to his personal Instagram, which links back to the Kimpton account, helping his more than 27,000 followers find and interact with the hotel's content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Try an &lt;strong&gt;Instagram takeover &lt;/strong&gt;by a micro-influencer to provide behind-the-scenes or unique looks at a brand or product. It's more creative to feature photos taken by different people, and it directs Instagram traffic between the brand's and the photographer's accounts for mutually beneficial results -- namely, more engagement and more followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3) Stitch Fix&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Personal shopping website Stitch Fix invites micro-influencers to &lt;strong&gt;contribute content&lt;/strong&gt; that the brand then promotes on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the post below, Stitch Fix's Instagram bio &lt;a href="https://blog.stitchfix.com/fashion-tips/my-body-my-style-sarah-tripp/"&gt;linked to a post&lt;/a&gt; featuring a Q&amp;amp;A with a fashion blogger micro-influencer about how she dresses for her body type:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt; 
 &lt;div style="padding: 8px;"&gt; 
  &lt;div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"&gt;
   &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQLN0ccBkmB/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;“I want every woman to know that being fashionable is as much about confidence as it is about style.” Read more about how @sassyredlipstick embraces her shape at the link in bio. #MyBodyMyStyle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A photo posted by Stitch Fix (@stitchfix) on Feb 6, 2017 at 7:30am PST&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;The micro-influencer also shared the image, mentioned Stitch Fix, and shared the blog post link on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BP0R3b8Ay6G/?taken-by=sassyredlipstick"&gt;her personal Instagram profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This micro-influencer strategy works because it drives traffic to a brand's blog and Instagram profile. Try reaching out to micro-influencers and offer to &lt;strong&gt;publish their content &lt;/strong&gt;and cross-promote it on social media to generate engagement from their followers and readers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4) Hawaiian Department of Tourism&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii's Department of Tourism tapped into the power of micro-influencers for its &lt;a href="http://mediakix.com/2016/05/instagram-marketing-case-study-hawaii-tourism-campaign/#gs.jZzPhTw"&gt;#LetHawaiiHappen Instagram campaign&lt;/a&gt;. It partnered with Instagram users who are travel bloggers or Hawaiian natives to share content &lt;strong&gt;promoting events and destinations&lt;/strong&gt; so visitors and Hawaiians would be interested in traveling to check them out.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/gohawaii/"&gt;Hawaii's Department of Tourism&lt;/a&gt; connected with photographer &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/rick_poon/"&gt;Rick Poon&lt;/a&gt; to showcase his visit to Hawaii and attract his audience to come visit.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt; 
 &lt;div style="padding: 8px;"&gt; 
  &lt;div style="background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;"&gt;
   &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7jjcEnxQ5S/" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;We can’t resist following @rick_poon and his travel and food adventures on Oahu and Kauai this week! Double tap if you’re craving some guava chiffon pancakes and kalua pork benedict right now. #LetHawaiiHappen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A photo posted by Hawaii (@gohawaii) on Sep 12, 2015 at 8:22pm PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;After the campaign, &lt;a href="http://mediakix.com/2016/05/instagram-marketing-case-study-hawaii-tourism-campaign/#gs.jZzPhTw"&gt;65% of people&lt;/a&gt; who saw the posts said they wanted to visit Hawaii (talk about effective). If you want to attract new followers and Instagram engagement, try reaching out to micro-influencers to &lt;strong&gt;promote an event or a location&lt;/strong&gt; that their followers might want to check out.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Think Small&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Are you on board with micro-influencers? Before you answer, consider the following.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a few downsides to this strategy. Notably, micro-influence works well on Instagram with visual products, such as a bright can of sparkling water or an eye-catching outfit. This might not be the best strategy for promoting complicated software or other technology. But remember, you can be creative. As long as you can find a micro-influencer to share an Instagram post that's compelling, you might&amp;nbsp;be able to generate much more engagement.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it's a lot of work to work with several micro-influencers. Brands have to reach out to them on Instagram and manage several different relationships. However, we think the payoff is worth it for authentic and engaging Instagram posts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on Instagram users tagging your brand or using a branded hashtag -- they might just be your next biggest promoter. And if you want to learn more about &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/6-step-process-maximise-influencer-marketing"&gt;influencer marketing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-for-business"&gt;Instagram content promotion&lt;/a&gt;, read our guides on these topics next.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>18 Beautiful New Ebook Templates [Free Download]</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-ebook-templates</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-ebook-templates" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2074430753-gif/ebook-template-lp-image-2.gif" alt="18 Beautiful New Ebook Templates [Free Download]" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;companies with 30 or more landing pages generate &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;7x more leads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; than those with fewer than ten?&lt;/strong&gt; But landing pages don't convert visitors to leads all by themselves -- without attractive and compelling offers behind them, they won't generate the tonnes of leads for your sales team that you want them to.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;companies with 30 or more landing pages generate &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;7x more leads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; than those with fewer than ten?&lt;/strong&gt; But landing pages don't convert visitors to leads all by themselves -- without attractive and compelling offers behind them, they won't generate the tonnes of leads for your sales team that you want them to.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;That's why it's so important to create valuable content people want to download, and then package it in a way that's visually appealing to your readers.&amp;nbsp;A big part of the ebook creation process is making it look both&amp;nbsp;professional and attractive&amp;nbsp;so people want to read it and share it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We know not every team&amp;nbsp;has someone in-house who can (or has time to) whip up a slick, highly shareable ebook design. But we have&amp;nbsp;good news: You don't need to be a designer by trade to design beautiful ebooks yourself. With the right resources and approach,&amp;nbsp;it doesn't have to be a&amp;nbsp;daunting task.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We created &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates?_ga=2.146592881.413518659.1563195890-1307414301.1541080541"&gt;ebook templates&lt;/a&gt; to help make this process easier for you -- and they were so popular that &lt;strong&gt;we decided to revamp the offer for 18 new-and-improved ebook templates for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We hope these templates&amp;nbsp;minimize the&amp;nbsp;time you spend&amp;nbsp;on the details of design, allowing you to concentrate on writing valuable, lead-generating content your readers will love.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates?_ga=2.229139292.1301801515.1563199473-1093622293.1516842654"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Untitled%20design%20(20)-1.png?width=1000&amp;amp;name=Untitled%20design%20(20)-1.png" width="1000" style="width: 1000px;" alt="Free ebook templates by HubSpot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5 style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates?_ga=2.183779171.413518659.1563195890-1307414301.1541080541"&gt;Download the Templates Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;With these slick new templates, you’ll be able to:&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create beautifully&amp;nbsp;designed ebooks&lt;/strong&gt; without either the cost of a designer or experience with InDesign/Illustrator/Photoshop.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose from six different ebook designs across three different platforms (Adobe InDesign, PowerPoint, and Google Slides),&lt;/strong&gt; and even add your own brand colors to any of&amp;nbsp;them in a few quick steps.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend more&amp;nbsp;time writing awesome content&lt;/strong&gt; and&amp;nbsp;less time getting the layout right.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use all of the stock images provided&lt;/strong&gt; in the&amp;nbsp;templates, free of charge.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save your ebooks as professional and attractive PDF files&lt;/strong&gt; that are ready for download.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>10 How-To Videos That Really Work (And Why)</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-videos-examples</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-videos-examples" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/how-to-videos-that-work.jpg" alt="how-to-videos-that-work" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever learned how to do something with the help of an internet search?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The answer is most likely a resounding “yes.” Most recently, I taught myself how to fold a fitted sheet with a helpful video from homemaker extraordinaire, and friend of Snoop Dogg, Martha Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever learned how to do something with the help of an internet search?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The answer is most likely a resounding “yes.” Most recently, I taught myself how to fold a fitted sheet with a helpful video from homemaker extraordinaire, and friend of Snoop Dogg, Martha Stewart.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Videos are an especially compelling way to learn how to do something online because, well, the video shows you exactly how to do it. I’m not alone here, either -- &lt;a href="/marketing/video-marketing"&gt;most customers&lt;/a&gt; would prefer to watch a marketing video rather than seeing an ad.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re among the &lt;a href="/marketing/video-marketing"&gt;45% of marketers&lt;/a&gt; who are adding video content to their strategy this year, there could be a lot of value in making videos specifically for those in your audience who are trying to learn how to do something, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll explore just how popular these searches are on YouTube and other platforms, and what you can learn from eight how-to videos about how to make great teaching videos of your own.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;How-To Video Searches Are Popular&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How-to searches are incredibly popular. Think about just your own life for a moment, and reconsider my question at the beginning of this blog post. They also may be a great opportunity for brands to show off their products.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-2018/"&gt; WyzOwl's 2018 Video Marketing Statistics Report&lt;/a&gt;, 72% of people prefer to learn about a product or service through video.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Video marketing is growing, and so is the number of platforms it can be seen on. While Youtube and Vimeo used to be the primary place to find videos, consumers now similarly use &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;social platforms like Facebook and Instagram&lt;/a&gt; to learn about brands and products.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;10 How-To Videos to Learn From&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. How to Fold a Fitted Sheet&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-a2FR1iwqg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You may recognize the title of this how-to video -- it's the one I mentioned earlier in this very blog post. Are you always geting stymied when putting away fitted sheets on laundry day like me?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What I love about this video is how it &lt;strong&gt;showcases personality&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a simple how-to video of humans demonstrating how to do something, without any animations or high tech features, but it's still extremely effective at teaching the viewer. Stewart and her guests make jokes about how hard it is to fold the sheet -- Stewart even joking that her inability to do so led to her divorce -- and they show the viewer how easy it is to get tripped up in the process. Stewart and her guests also have empathy for the viewer and show exactly how to avoid pitfalls along the way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway for marketers &lt;/strong&gt;If you want to create a how-to video "hosted" by a real, live human, make sure they act like a human. Videos are an easy way for brands to showcase personality, so put yourself in the shoes of your viewer, and infuse humor, sincerity, and empathy into your instructions. If the concept you're explaining is complicated, tell the viewer that. If you had no idea how to use your product at first, share that. Speaking like a human -- instead of reading off a script like a robot -- will make your video memorable, effective, and enjoyable, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. How to Cook Perfect Pasta&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aVOjLuw-Qg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tasty on BuzzFeed shares cooking and recipe videos that frequently go viral on YouTube and other social media and reach &lt;a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/how-tasty-mastered-social-publishing-part-buzzfeed-s-plan-make-50-revenue-video-174325/"&gt;millions of people every month&lt;/a&gt;. But this video isn't one of Tasty's trademark recipe videos -- it's one of several how-to videos that break down common or difficult cooking skills step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this video, Tasty uses &lt;strong&gt;hyperlapse &lt;/strong&gt;to speed up the cooking demonstration and get the viewer the information they need as quickly as possible. This fast-paced filming style is eye-catching if it starts auto-playing in a social media feed, too. Tasty chose a smart how-to search term, too -- there's a ton of &lt;strong&gt;search volume&lt;/strong&gt; around the phrase "&lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=how%20to%20cook%20pasta"&gt;how to cook pasta&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway for marketers: &lt;/strong&gt;Viewers prefer YouTube videos &lt;a href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/"&gt;on the shorter side&lt;/a&gt;, so sped-up hyperlapse filming helps conserve time and creates a neat visual effect. Work backward and conduct keyword research to learn what terms your audience is searching for to find a topic to make your video about.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. How to Escape Quicksand&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/snTNnCPNSUk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Evidently, Princess Buttercup's tragic fall into quicksand in &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride &lt;/em&gt;wouldn't have been quite as terrifying in real life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this how-to video, Tech Insider uses &lt;strong&gt;captions and animations&lt;/strong&gt; to break down a complicated concept. I wasn't exactly searching for information on how to escape quicksand when I found this video, but the &lt;strong&gt;unique subject matter&lt;/strong&gt; made me instantly click, intrigued. What's more, the &lt;strong&gt;sound isn't required&lt;/strong&gt; -- although it does add dramatic effect -- which might make people more likely to click and watch all the way through, since many social media videos are &lt;a href="http://digiday.com/media/silent-world-facebook-video/"&gt;watched on mute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway for marketers: &lt;/strong&gt;Your how-to videos don't necessarily need to be about a dry topic related to your industry. If you create a fascinating piece of content that goes viral, you'll generate interest in your brand that way. Animations and captions help to show -- rather than explain -- trickier concepts like quicksand, so consider these visual elements for high-level explanations. And if there's a way to make your videos volume-agnostic, do so. Some videos will require narration or other sounds, but the visual elements mentioned previously could do the talking for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. How to Blow Out Curly Hair&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QC1ciopqIaQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who's ever gotten a blowout knows that it can be expensive and time-consuming to have it professionally done.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So Bustle cleverly made a how-to video that teaches viewers how to DIY and save money-- a motivating factor behind many how-to online searches, I suspect. This video is also short, which &lt;a href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/"&gt;MiniMatters suggests&lt;/a&gt; for enticing viewers to watch videos all the way through. YouTube counts a view as once a video has been watched for &lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/whats-a-video-view-on-facebook-only-3-seconds-vs-30-at-youtube-128311"&gt;approximately 30 seconds&lt;/a&gt;, so viewers with &lt;a href="https://advertising.microsoft.com/en/wwdocs/user/display/cl/researchreport/31966/en/microsoft-attention-spans-research-report.pdf"&gt;short attention spans&lt;/a&gt; might be more likely to stick around for that long if they see a video is shorter, like this one.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway for marketers: &lt;/strong&gt;Almost everybody wants to save money where they can, so think about ways your how-to video could help viewers do that when brainstorming topics. When filming, try to keep videos as short as possible to attract viewers and keep them watching all the way through to steadily increase your number of YouTube views.&lt;/p&gt;

More than just an office staple, a blazer can dress up any outfit with ease. In this episode of #ThePreviewEdit, our Associate Social Media Editor @mauraisabelr shows you how to style it for the office and beyond! Blazer from @forme Video by @mauraisabelr #blazer #fashion #style #tutorial #howto #stylingvideo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/previewph/" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;"&gt; Preview.ph&lt;/a&gt; (@previewph) on Jul 8, 2019 at 8:02pm PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;In this short, sweet Instagram video, verified style influencer &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/previewph/"&gt;@PreviewPH&lt;/a&gt; shows off three ways to style a blazer from &lt;a href="https://www.formeclothing.com/"&gt;ForMe&lt;/a&gt;. This video is great for those who are interested in trying out new fashions but don't exactly know how to wear items or accessories. In this video, she demonstrates three ways of wearing a blazer, which could accommodate the fashion styles of three different people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway for marketers:&lt;/strong&gt; How-to videos can be a great way to show off how a product works and how it can be used. This type of video is clearly promoting one specific blazer and brand, but it's more valuable than a standard ad because it shows potential buyers how they can wear it. If people who are hesitant about a new fashion style see this how-to video, they might feel more confident in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. How to Asana: Planning with Asana calendar&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/w8t6KYiVPyc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Asana cleverly brands its how-to video series as "How to Asana," and all of the videos in the series feature a &lt;strong&gt;consistent theme&lt;/strong&gt;. All of the videos in this series are under two minutes in length, are hosted by the same person, and feature an eye-popping yellow background. The meat of the video consists of a screencast of someone using the Asana calendar tool, but these branding details bring life to what would otherwise be a rather boring video.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway for marketers:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're thinking about creating a how-to video series, take the extra time to make it memorable and recognizable. These efforts will make videos look more professional and will make viewers want to keep tuning in for more helpful videos if they know they can expect more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. How to Create an Animated GIF in Photoshop&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/omdfcGYEqPY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Who else here loves GIFs? That's right -- everyone loves GIFs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But before I watched the video above, I had no idea how easy it was to make my own. That's the ideal reaction to a how-to video, by the way -- "that was so easy."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Adobe's how-to video is a great example of a software demonstration video because it &lt;strong&gt;zooms in &lt;/strong&gt;on only the necessary information. Instead of confusing the viewer by showing the entire Photoshop interface, the video features magnified animations of only the buttons and tools they need to accomplish the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway for marketers:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're making a technology demonstration how-to video, consider how it will appear to any first-time product users watching. Try to minimize any confusion by only filming elements of the technology needed for your video so viewers can follow along on their devices.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. How to Increase Your Facebook Reach and Outsmart the Algorithm&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;div class="video-container-responsive"&gt;
 &lt;iframe style="margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eb6v2Ktdn8s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You might be hesitant to create videos to explain a complicated subject matter, but that could actually be the most effective medium to help your audience understand something.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this video, my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conleymn/"&gt;Megan Conley&lt;/a&gt; breaks down the many nuances of Facebook's News Feed algorithm in a &lt;strong&gt;clear and concise manner. &lt;/strong&gt;Then, graphics, animations, and screencasts supplement what she talks about with &lt;strong&gt;data visualizations&lt;/strong&gt; to make the stats and figures more memorable for the viewer. Finally, the video ends with &lt;strong&gt;helpful next steps&lt;/strong&gt; viewers can take to solve the problem outlined in the video. The video isn't about how to use HubSpot software at all -- it's only in the business of helping people get better results.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway for marketers: The most compelling how-to video might be one that doesn't mention your product at all. Think about what questions your audience might be asking and establish your brand as a thought leader with helpful videos that don't end with a sales pitch.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. How to Fix a Chair with Noodles&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;

  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/crafty.life.hacks/" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;"&gt; Crafts, Hacks, DIYs and more!&lt;/a&gt; (@crafty.life.hacks) on Jul 8, 2019 at 1:57pm PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;This interesting Instagram video from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/crafty.life.hacks/"&gt;@Crafty.Life.Hacks&lt;/a&gt; shows viewers how to fix a wooden chair by replacing missing wood with instant noodles. While this video is short and easy-to-follow it is fascinating because it teaches viewers about an alternative use for an every-day household food item.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaways for marketers:&lt;/strong&gt; This example shows how a product can have multiple purposes. While marketers will want to make how-to videos that show the primary purpose of their product, sometimes, it can still be helpful to think outside of the box and show off other ways your product could be used.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you're selling a food product, you might want to craft a recipe video that shows how it can be used as an ingredient, or a DIY that shows how it can be used as a tool -- like the video above.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. How to Make Momofuku's King Crab Noodle&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this Facebook video, shared by Vice's food blog &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/munchies/?fref=mentions"&gt;Munchies&lt;/a&gt;, Chef Max Ng shows viewers how to cook his grandmother's King Crab Noodle recipe -- which he serves at the Momofuku Ssam Bar in New York City. Although this video is on the longer side, he shows audiences a simple step-by-step cooking process that they can easily follow.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmunchieshowto%2Fvideos%2F2188554687847320%2F&amp;amp;show_text=1&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="470" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This type of video might be a helpful how-to example for local restaurants or food publications that want to show off their favorite recipes. Promotionally, this video also gives some great brand awareness to Munchies and the Momofuko restaurant.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaways for marketers:&lt;/strong&gt; You can get away with videos on the longer side if they clearly describe a step-by-step process like cooking. How-to videos can also be a great source for cross-promotional content. In the example above, Max Ng, Momofuko, and Munchies are all highlighted in an entertaining and informative way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;How to Make How-To Videos&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have inspiration from real-life B2B and B2C brand videos, start thinking about how you could create helpful content for your audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates"&gt;Create buyer personas&lt;/a&gt; and use these to inform your strategy. What types of questions does your audience ask about your product? What questions do they ask about your industry? What problems does your product solve that you could demonstrate in a video?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use tools like &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/"&gt;Google Trends&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial-keywords-tool"&gt;HubSpot’s Keywords tool&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the types of searches your audience is conducting and what content you could create to answer those questions.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 16 Best WordPress Analytics Plugins in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/wordpress-analytics-plugin</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/wordpress-analytics-plugin" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/wordpress-analytics-plugins.jpg" alt="wordpress-analytics-plugins" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;What's the &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; thing more overwhelming than the volume of your analytics data?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What's the &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; thing more overwhelming than the volume of your analytics data?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I'm willing to be its the volume of analytics plugin options on WordPress.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Installing an analytics plugin for your &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/wordpress-website"&gt;WordPress site&lt;/a&gt; allows you to get all your site's data, metrics, and insights without leaving your WordPress dashboard. The majority of users choose Google Analytics, although I've chosen some non-GA plugins, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While Google Analytics is a powerful option, many find the sheer amount of data available on GA daunting, and the interface clunky. WordPress plugins aim to simplify the interface so that users get to the data they need without feeling overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you do use Google Analytics, we have a comprehensive guide on &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-analytics-wordpress"&gt;How to Set Up Google Analytics for WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With new plugins hitting the market monthly, and specialist plugins offering specific insights, it can be difficult to figure out which one is right for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To help you sort through, we've compiled a list of the best analytics for WordPress plugins in 2019. We'll explore basic differences, as well as features and benefits of each option, to help you choose the best plugin for your needs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/"&gt;MonsterInsights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free | Premium: from $99&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 3.9 out of 5 from 637 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Generally considered the king of analytics plugins, &lt;a href="https://www.monsterinsights.com/"&gt;MonsterInsights&lt;/a&gt; is a good all-rounder. It's also the most popular Google Analytics plugin on WordPress, with over two million active installations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like most of the plugins in this list, MonsterInsights adds your Google Analytics tracking code to your site with no coding required on your part. It pulls your data into a user-friendly interface that runs inside your WordPress dashboard and offers flexibility for growing sites with free and premium versions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It offers all the Google Analytics data you would expect, broken down into audience and behavior metrics. Additionally, you get more advanced features like ecommerce reports with the premium version.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this goliath is you can't get statistics on individual pieces of content like you can with Analytify.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-1.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-analytify/"&gt;Analytify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free | Premium: $39 per year&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 4.9 out of 5 from 220 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Analytify is a big hitter in the world of WordPress analytics and will install your Google Analytics tracking code for you. The interface allows you to access your data right from your WordPress dashboard.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Analytify is especially good for ecommerce businesses, since it offers enhanced ecommerce tracking features. The free version is fairly limited but the premium version is substantially cheaper than MonsterInsights, while offering similar functionality plus the benefit of being able to dig into individual posts and pages.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the free version, you can monitor your site stats and you gain limited access to general reporting features. This includes tracking features like page views, top countries, social media statistics and top referrers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the premium version, you gain additional features like real-time statistics, campaign statistics, and email notifications.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019.jpeg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-analytify/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/"&gt;Google Analytics Dashboard for WP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 4.3 out of 5 from 389 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It may not have the catchiest of names, but this plugin is all about functionality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It does what it says on the tin. The interface isn't as pretty as some of the more polished plugins, but you get all the features you would expect -- insertion of tracking code, Google Analytics data, real-time tracking -- right in your WordPress dashboard for free.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A solid option for those who know they don't want to upgrade and pay for a premium plugin.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-8.png?width=417&amp;amp;name=The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-8.png" alt="" width="417" style="width: 417px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/clicky-analytics/"&gt;Clicky Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free | Paid: from $9.99 per month&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 4.6 out of 5 from 17 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Aside from having an excellent name, Clicky offers a plain and simple view of your analytics, which is ideal for people who feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of options available within Google Analytics. Additionally, it installs its own Clicky tracking code into your site so you don't have to mess around with code.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Clicky provides detailed insights that are still simple enough for the average blogger to understand. Most of the functionality is available for free, but some features like video analytics and custom data tracking is only available with the paid version. It also has some quirky features like a live map so you can track your visitors in real-time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-10.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/clicky-analytics/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/crazyegg-heatmap-tracking/#reviews"&gt;Crazy Egg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Premium: $9 per month&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 3.8 out of 5 from 5 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Crazy Egg is an open source plugin offering a totally different perspective than most of the others, since it adds Crazy Egg's tracking code to your site. This allows you to watch via heat maps -- in real-time -- what visitors are hovering over and clicking on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The plugin also offers comprehensive A/B testing based on various content variables like color, copy and content placement, to improve the user experience and increase conversions. This is a good alternative to Google Analytics for users more interested in conversion optimization.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-1.jpeg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/crazyegg-heatmap-tracking/#reviews"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/analytics-cat/"&gt;Analytics Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 3.8 out of 5 from 5 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/analytics-cat/"&gt;Analytics Cat&lt;/a&gt; is a super simple, lightweight plugin. If you're looking to add a Google Analytics tracking code but don't want to weigh down your WordPress site with the dashboard integration, it can do it in minutes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Analytics Cat offers a simple way to stop your data from becoming corrupted by your obsessive self-navigation, since it provides the ability to exclude logged-in users from your Google Analytics tracking. You can also exclude as many other user roles as you'd like.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-6.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/analytics-cat/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ga-google-analytics/"&gt;GA Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free | Premium: from $15 one-off&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating&lt;/strong&gt;: 4.9 out of 5 from 71 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple tool that does one job -- it adds a Google Analytics code to every page on your site. It doesn't pull in or display any stats for you, but it does its job well. This is ideal for complex sites with hundreds of pages. If you're happy with keeping your Google Analytics off your WordPress dashboard but want to ensure the tracking code is on every page, this is the plugin for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the premium version enables a host of advanced features like an opt-out for visitors. It also supports custom code and lets you disable tracking on logged-in users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-2.jpeg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ga-google-analytics/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/wordpress"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating: &lt;/strong&gt;4.6 stars from 104 ratings&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HubSpot's WordPress plugin isn't just an analytics plugin -- it also allows you to implement HubSpot's forms, pop-ups, and live chat.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HubSpot's plugin offers incredibly detailed data on the leads you collect. Additionally, you can get an in-depth understanding of which CTAs drive the highest number of sign-ups, enabling you to convert visitors more effectively. This user information is synced with your HubSpot CRM.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-5.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wd-google-analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics WD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free | Premium: $30 per year&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating: &lt;/strong&gt;4.5 out of 5 from 93 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This plugin is a solid option and has both a free and reasonably priced premium version. With a low barrier to entry, it's a user-friendly, simple way to view your stats within WordPress.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The free version includes page views, top performing pages, a centralized dashboard, comprehensive reports, and bounce rates. However, if you want Google Analytics coverage, ecommerce reports, AdSense and AdWords reports, you'll need the premium version.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-7.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wd-google-analytics/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-analytics-events/"&gt;WP Google Analytics Events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free | Premium: from $79 per year.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 4.6 out of 5 from 28 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Designed to offer detailed behavioral analytics, WP Google Analytics Events digs deeper into your Google Analytics data. For instance, just because a visitor navigated to a blog post, doesn't mean they scrolled down and read all the way through. WP Google Analytics Events can help you see what's really going on at the level of individual events.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The downside of this plugin is it's difficult to set up, so this is ideal for more advanced users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/The%2016%20Best%20WordPress%20Analytics%20Plugins%20in%202019-3.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p style="font-size: 11px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-analytics-events/"&gt;Image Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/"&gt;Jetpack by WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price&lt;/strong&gt;: Free | Premium: from $5 per month&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress.org rating:&lt;/strong&gt; 4.6 out of 5 from 28 reviews&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jetpack is a multi-functioning tool for design, marketing and security -- analytics is just one of its many features. It displays your stats via a simple interface offering a handy overview of how your site is doing. However, don't expect to be able to drill down into the data on individual pages and posts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you would expect from a WordPress.com product, the plugin offers good support and detailed troubleshooting guides. Best of all, Jetpack offers a smiley face at the bottom of your page to show whether the JetPack analytics tools are working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Analytics Plugin Should You Choose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You may want to choose more than one analytics plugin, since many of them are specialized for certain tasks.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to bring the power of Google Analytics into your WordPress dashboard, go for a plugin like MonsterInsights or Analytify, which both have excellent free versions as well as comprehensive premium versions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there are some plugins specialized in privacy, speed and reliability. There are also some simple tools to quickly set you up with a Google Analytics code.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about WordPress plugins is you can install them and play around with the free versions to see if they work for you without committing to anything. So give a few of these options a try and see what's the best fit for you and your analytics needs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, find out how to save time and maximize ROI by &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/wordpress"&gt;hooking up your HubSpot data with your WordPress site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why You Shouldn't Buy Instagram Followers (&amp; What to Do Instead)</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buy-instagram-followers</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buy-instagram-followers" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/buying-instagram-followers.jpg" alt="buying-instagram-followers" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;You might know your Instagram content is good, but imagine how much better it will seem if it looks like 10,000 people agree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You might know your Instagram content is good, but imagine how much better it will seem if it looks like 10,000 people agree.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re trying to become a social media celebrity or simply looking to spread brand awareness on Instagram, it can seem tempting to pay for your first couple thousand followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of services available that allow you to buy 1,000 followers for the price of a small Starbucks latte. But of course, if it really was that cheap and easy, everyone would be doing it. So what’s the catch? Is buying Instagram followers legal and safe for your business? Is it a worthwhile investment?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here, we’ve gone ahead and covered all the questions you might have about buying Instagram followers to give you a better idea of how it actually works. We’ve also explored the pros and cons, so you can decide for yourself if it’s a good move for your brand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;Can you buy Instagram followers?&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Yes, you can buy Instagram followers. There are plenty of cheap services available that allow you to buy 1,000 followers for as little as $10 USD. But you’re only paying for a number. Many of those followers are either bots or inactive accounts, which means they’ll never engage with your posts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As a quick Google search will reveal, there are many cheap services you can use to buy Instagram followers. For about $6 USD, you can get 500 followers, and for about $10 USD, you can get 1,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of these purchasable followers, however, are either bots or inactive accounts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When you buy Instagram followers, you’re paying for a number alone. Engagement is not guaranteed, or even likely.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In addition to buying followers directly, you can also pay services to strategically follow other accounts on your behalf based on your preferences (location, hashtag usage, account type, and gender). Ideally, those followed accounts will then follow you back.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With this option, your followers are more likely to be real people, but engagement is still unlikely. Since you can't even guarantee these accounts will follow you back, it’s a risky investment. Most accounts &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; follow you back, and even if they do, they probably aren’t going to be long-term, loyal, or active followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your priority is simply to have a big follower count, these services can definitely help you. When your number of organic followers dips, these services even replenish your pool with other followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But remember the risks: these followers will probably never like or comment on a post, and if you’re caught with a ton of fake followers, you could ruin your credibility with your real audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: would you keep following an account if you saw that most of their “loyal audience” were inactive accounts or bots? I’m guessing not. It could seem deceitful, and lead you to believe the brand couldn’t get authentic followers through good content alone.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hsg-featured-snippet"&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;Should you buy Instagram followers?&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It’s not a good idea to buy Instagram followers. The purchased followers are likely bots or inactive accounts, so they won’t engage with your posts. This means your posts won’t show up on Explore Pages, or on your real audience’s newsfeeds. It will also make it hard to measure metrics.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;You're buying fake Instagram followers.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The main reason buying Instagram followers can prove to be a wasted investment is because the accounts you follow often aren't real.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/fake-followers"&gt;Fake followers&lt;/a&gt; are created either because they're managed by users whose only goal is to get followed in return, or because these accounts are sponsored by services that sell followers -- as we discussed in the section above. And while these accounts might offer early engagement, they'll ultimately become a drain on your Instagram account's performance metrics (we'll get to that in just a minute).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;You'll get early engagement that tapers off.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Purchased Instagram followers also provide no long-term value to your profile's content. The followers you buy might give you views, likes, and comments early into acquiring them as a follower, but the attention they throw you now won't be there later -- when you start reporting on how your Instagram account is performing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And how helpful, really, are 10,000 followers that don't engage with you? Engagement is key to how &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-does-the-instagram-algorithm-work"&gt;Instagram’s algorithm&lt;/a&gt; displays posts to users. Without likes or comments, your post probably won’t show up on your audience’s newsfeeds, and it also won’t show up on any Explore Pages.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Having a lot of followers &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; convince users to follow you organically, but it's not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Users might notice you don’t have a ton of engagement on your posts, which could deter them from following you. If you have 10,000 followers but only four likes per post, it won't take people long to realize something is up.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Without real followers to engage with your content, your posts are essentially hidden from everyone except your inauthentic audience. Plus, your fake followers won’t share your post on any of their channels. And they won’t discuss your brand in real life with friends or family, because, well … they don’t exist in real life (no offense, bots).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Bought Instagram followers can distort your performance metrics.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s practically impossible to measure how well your target audience is connecting with your brand if a high percentage of that audience isn’t real. How will you measure posts that do well with your real audience if those bots and inactive accounts skew the ratio?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know how well your posts are doing or what your real audience thinks, you’ll never convert your Instagram followers into real customers. And isn’t that the point?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you pay for Instagram followers, you aren’t paying for quality, real-life followers. You’re paying for a blank number. And since Instagram’s algorithm is largely tied to engagement, not followers, buying followers isn’t a long-term solution. In fact, it isn’t really a solution at all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take the time, energy, and money that you would’ve dedicated to buying followers, and focus instead on building genuine relationships with a real audience. If your content is engaging and authentic, your loyal followers will spread the word and engage with your brand without needing any bribes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Instagram Identifies and Purges Fake Followers&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Instagram has updated its terms of use to identify and remove inauthentic accounts from its platform. Instagram is &lt;a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/11/19/reducing-inauthentic-activity-on-instagram/"&gt;removing any likes, follows, or comments&lt;/a&gt; from third-party apps that are designed to artificially grow accounts' audiences. By buying followers, you violate Instagram's &lt;a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F477434105621119%2F%3Fhelpref%3Dhc_fnav%26bc%5B0%5D%3DInstagram%2520Help%26bc%5B1%5D%3DPrivacy%2520and%2520Safety%2520Center&amp;amp;h=AT3PjFlQOmbj2orfRO3bwbh0KuCA5W49KMxLhULH-q_riOS9aqoP4YH-DriPBD1u7J9Uj63MtXsrujo0LtOfIXcKRreaRlom3AOF9oZ4TBum48XVn5lOEcR1JLxoSAA2HPGGGZ4uGwG3iCNIQvQn49c"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and it may trigger a reaction from Instagram moderators.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instagram is looking to maintain genuine interactions on its site, protecting real accounts and experiences. Fake or bought activity infringes upon this mission and might result in consequences, so it's better to grow your audience organically.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to Buying Instagram Followers&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instagram's new algorithm rewards engagement more than follower count, displaying content similar to posts users engaged with in the past. In order to drive engagement, there are many different actions one can try on the platform to get in front of your ideal audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By using good &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/instagram-marketing?_ga=2.224389531.122841317.1562677793-527251855.1560789477"&gt;Instagram marketing&lt;/a&gt; practices -- whether you are building your personal brand or a company account -- you can better reach the nearly 800 million monthly Instagram users and build an authentic audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First, make your account public so that users can see your profile and content. This way, you can grow your audience organically when your content pops up on users' explore pages, attracting and delighting your target viewership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Next, publish a variety of posts to your feed: you can post images, GIFs, videos, Boomerangs, quizzes on your story, how-tos, user-generated content, and so much more. Build trust and excitement among your followers by using high-quality photos, writing catchy captions, posting consistently, and keeping up a unique style overall to differentiate yourself from other accounts. Do your research on which hashtags generate a lot of buzz and which are aligned with your brand -- hashtags can be a great way to reach new audiences if done correctly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your brand personality, it can help to be &lt;a href="/marketing/gain-instagram-followers?_ga=2.224389531.122841317.1562677793-527251855.1560789477"&gt;funny or witty in your content&lt;/a&gt;. Having an acute awareness of how your brand is perceived and the trends going around Instagram will serve you when choosing content to post and how to interact with your Instagram community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, utilize the many different channels on the platform, like Instagram Live, IGTV, Instagram Stories, or Shopping on Instagram. There are so many different ways to connect with users, and by driving engagement through these features, you can drive engagement and traffic organically and authentically.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;a class="close"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>How HubSpot Personalized Our Chatbots to Improve The Customer Experience and Support Our Sales Team</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment.jpg" alt="chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;You can’t talk about the future of marketing without chatbots. People are increasingly interested in communicating with brands in a more &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/chat-new-hubspot-conversations"&gt;personal, conversational way&lt;/a&gt; — and chatbots can help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;You can’t talk about the future of marketing without chatbots. People are increasingly interested in communicating with brands in a more &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/chat-new-hubspot-conversations"&gt;personal, conversational way&lt;/a&gt; — and chatbots can help.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Including chatbots on your website helps visitors find what they are looking for and connect them with your team in an immediate, frictionless way. Chatbots also follow the Inbound Messaging Framework.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-1.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-1.png" alt="chatbots-inbound-messaging-framework" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the secrets to building a &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-build-a-chatbot"&gt;chatbot strategy&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On HubSpot’s marketing team, we seek to deliver a world-class customer experience. We consistently ask: How can &lt;a href="/marketing/best-ai-chatbot"&gt;chatbots&lt;/a&gt; better serve our various audiences (visitors, leads, and customers) to help direct them to the right resources for their needs? Also, how can we use chatbots to support our sales team and reach our goals?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/chatbot-builder"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use HubSpot's free Chatbot Builder Software to easily build and launch chatbots on your website — no coding required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;A Customer-Focused Bot Experience&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots work when they're contextual and relevant to specific problems folks are having. Through conversations with our sales team, we learned that 15% of chat questions on the website were about getting technical support. We were creating friction for our customers because our sales team (who answers chat questions onsite) is not as well equipped to answer these questions as our &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; team is.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So, we created a bot to direct our customers to the right resources for technical support (our support team, knowledgebase, and community). If they were not looking for technical support, we passed their questions about HubSpot features and pricing to our sales team.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-2.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-2.png" alt="chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-2" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We rolled out these bots across the primary site pages and saw an &lt;strong&gt;80% increase&lt;/strong&gt; in our sales team efficiency: a measure of success based on the number of meetings we booked divided by the total number of chats handled. And, it was a far better customer experience, as our customers could access technical support more easily.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It was a big win, but our work was hardly done. As we took a step back, we realized that this “support bot” experience was not serving all of our users. About &lt;strong&gt;70% of our audience is visitors and leads&lt;/strong&gt;, compared with 30% who are users and customers. This first bot experience was designed with only 30% of our audience in mind. Ignoring 70% of our audience meant we were leaving money on the table.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;A Personalized Experience for All Visitors&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We needed to create a personalized experience for the visitor and lead audiences, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the “support bot” experience, it was odd to ask visitors and leads if they needed support when we knew they weren’t using our tools yet. Rather than directing visitors and leads to chat or support, we wanted to give these visitors their own “self-help” option. Why not give them the option to get started for free with the HubSpot CRM? That way they could start using our free tools or chat with our sales team about features and pricing for advanced tools.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-3-1.png?width=545&amp;amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-3-1.png" alt="chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-3-1" width="545" style="width: 545px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now we had designed &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; personalized experiences: one for those already using our software (customers) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; those who had yet to experience it (visitors).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We believed this to be a better experience for each audience, because it offered &lt;strong&gt;contextual options based on their relationship with HubSpot&lt;/strong&gt;. However, we wanted to test it first with an experiment.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up the Experiment&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In order to test our hypothesis that this would be a better experience for both of these users, we set up an A/B test on one of our product pages so we could see exactly how the bot for visitors performed against the current bot experience (designed for customers).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;First, we defined our metrics for success. We looked at:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Sales team efficiency: # of meetings booked by our sales team ÷ the number of chats they handled&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;# of signups for the CRM&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We also compared these for each bot (control vs. variant), and by each audience (visitors vs. customer).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We chose one of our product pages and directed 50% of its site traffic to a cloned page with the new bot experience. The test was live and ready to run for one month while we waited (somewhat) patiently for the results.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-4.gif?width=480&amp;amp;name=chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-4.gif" alt="chatbots-improve-customer-experience-experiment-4" width="480" style="width: 480px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me, waiting at my desk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Experiment Results&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We isolated our results for the audience the test was focused on: visitors. We looked at how the control (support bot) performed against the variant (lead bot).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Sales team efficiency: increased by almost 70% in the variant&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;# of CRM signups: increased by 7%&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The increase in CRM signups indicated that visitors were finding the right option for them (starting for free) and diving in to try out our software for free.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As a result, fewer chats reached our sales team, but we saw a similar number of meetings booked to continue the sales conversation after a chat. This meant a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The sales team was able to spend more time and focus on higher quality chats that were more likely to turn into sales&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;We weren’t losing demand, because we still saw a similar number of meetings booked. We were still capturing those interested in having a sales conversation, just in a more efficient way.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better segmentation makes life better for everyone.&lt;/strong&gt; Making a bot personalized for visitors helped the customers’ bot perform better as well. We learned the customer bot works very well for the audience it was designed for — performing 52% better when shown only to customers than when it was shown to all visitors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways for Your Business&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to recognize that different segments of your audience have different problems and what works for one audience isn't the best for another. By understanding the problems that our visitors are facing, and personalizing their chatbot experience onsite, you can create a better prospect &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; customer experience. When you anticipate the help that people need better, your metrics will improve as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And you may be thinking, “OK, that sounds pretty good for HubSpot, but what about my business? How can I create a more contextual bot experience for my business?” Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create a list of the various audiences you are serving on your website.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;For each audience, describe the types of questions they might have.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Determine the resources or people who can best answer those questions so you can help them find what they are looking for faster and with less friction.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then implement it!&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/conversations"&gt;HubSpot Conversations tool&lt;/a&gt; gives you the ability to target your chatflows with segmented lists based on data in your CRM so you can create a personalized experience as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots work shoulder-to-shoulder alongside with our sales team to provide an excellent, personalized purchase experience that also helps us identify visitors who are possible good fit customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots can do the same for your business and audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ad Tracking: What It Is &amp; How to Do It</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7249/a-marketer-s-guide-to-tracking-online-campaigns.aspx</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7249/a-marketer-s-guide-to-tracking-online-campaigns.aspx" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Ad-tracking.jpg" alt="Ad-tracking" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Back in the days of &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;-esque advertising agencies, tracking how many people engaged with a particular ad campaign was nearly impossible to do well. Advertisers would sink money into mediums like radio and print, and hope sales of the advertised product went up. There was no dependably accurate way to determine how many people engaged with an ad or purchased a product because of it. In fact, the term ROI (return on investment) wasn't even widely used &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/2013/04/27/roi-definition/"&gt;until the mid-1960s&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in the days of &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt;-esque advertising agencies, tracking how many people engaged with a particular ad campaign was nearly impossible to do well. Advertisers would sink money into mediums like radio and print, and hope sales of the advertised product went up. There was no dependably accurate way to determine how many people engaged with an ad or purchased a product because of it. In fact, the term ROI (return on investment) wasn't even widely used &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/2013/04/27/roi-definition/"&gt;until the mid-1960s&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since then. Advertisers now have access to a wealth of granular ad tracking data for every single campaign they run -- so much data, in fact, that most marketers need to spend significant time sifting through dashboards to determine which points actually matter to their bottom line. Ad tracking has made it possible for marketers to more accurately measure, test, and revise ads based on how users interact with their online campaigns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're new to running online ads, it's important to spend some time thinking about the specific metrics that will determine the success of your campaign. Ad tracking today exists across a number of different tools and platforms, and advertisers have the ability to collect data on everything from views and clicks, to impressions and behavior across multiple sessions and websites.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of data available can be overwhelming (not to mention distracting from your goals), so deciding on one or two key performance indicators (KPIs) will help focus your efforts and make reporting more straightforward and effective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;As William Stentz, Director of Marketing Analytics at Carmichael Lynch, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/measure-kpi"&gt;reminds us&lt;/a&gt;, "Good key performance indicators are simple, timely, critical to the success of a project, and not financial in nature. But you also need to add in one thing if you want it to be a successful marketing metric -- &lt;strong&gt;it must represent a key behavior you wanted to see&lt;/strong&gt;. Look at your campaign and ask yourself: What’s the behavior I want to influence, not just something I can measure?"&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/analyze-performance-display-ads"&gt;We wrote an article here&lt;/a&gt; that can help you determine the right metrics to track based on the goals of your ad campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you've determined the metrics you want to track for your ad, it's time to find the best ad tracking method for your purposes. The exact ad tracking methods available to you will vary based on where you run your ads and which tools you're using, but here are a few basic types to keep in mind. It's important to note that the following ad tracking methods aren't mutually exclusive -- in fact, when used together they can provide even more powerful insights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking URLs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A tracking URL is a normal page URL from your website with a &lt;i&gt;tracking token&lt;/i&gt; added to the end of it. Here's an example landing page URL by itself, and with a tracking token (in bold).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Regular old landing page URL:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://www.yourwebsite.com/your-landing-page/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Landing page URL with a tracking token:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://www.yourwebsite.com/your-landing-page/&lt;strong&gt;?utm_campaign=test-campaign&amp;amp;utm_source=email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the page URL is the same in both cases, but in the second case, there's some extra stuff added to the end. &lt;strong&gt;This extra stuff is your tracking token, also called a UTM parameter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So how does this "extra stuff" help you track things, exactly?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When a user clicks on a URL with a UTM parameter added to the end, it essentially sends a signal back to your ad tracking tool that the URL was clicked. The &lt;strong&gt;"source=_____"&lt;/strong&gt; bit of the tracking token can provide information about where the user clicked the link. Similarly, the &lt;strong&gt;"campaign=_____"&lt;/strong&gt; bit can be used to signal to your tracking tool that the link should be bucketed as part of a campaign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you were to run the same ad on multiple websites and wanted to know which one generated the most clicks, you could define the two different websites as sources in the UTM parameters of your links.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about tracking parameters and how they work in &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're running a PPC campaign, sending an email, or putting an advertisement on another website, tracking URLs are ideal for calculating the number of visits, leads, and conversions you've generated from your hard work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking Pixels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A tracking pixel is a tiny, often transparent, 1px by 1px image that can be placed in an email, display ad, or simply on a webpage. When it loads, it sends a signal back to your tracking tool that a user has viewed the page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tracking pixels are also capable of collecting pretty comprehensive data about a user's activity and browser configuration -- but you should only ever track information that is directly useful to your buyer's journey and will provide a better, more personalized experience for your target users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When used correctly, tracking pixels can help optimize your ads and get them in front of a receptive audience. For example, if you run a banner ad with a tracking pixel, you'll be able to gather information about how many people just view versus actually click on your ad, which will help you determine whether or not an ad was actually successful (and worth running again).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For context, here's how big a tracking pixel appears (no, that's not just a speck of dust on your screen):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-25%20at%201.50.11%20PM.png?width=246&amp;amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-06-25%20at%201.50.11%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-25 at 1.50.11 PM" width="246" style="width: 246px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for: &lt;/strong&gt;Tracking pixels are incredibly useful for tracking the success of your online campaigns through every step of your conversion path. They can give you insight into how users are interacting with your ads, and help you optimize each stage of your user journey from initial touch through final purchase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cookies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cookies can help you gain insight into user behavior on your website across multiple sessions of activity. Marketers need to gain explicit consent from users before using cookies to track their activity. When explicit consent is given, cookies can be used to customize a user's experience. Here's a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/what-is-cookie-tracking"&gt;deeper dive on cookies&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn more about the technical aspects of how they function.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From an ad tracking perspective, cookies are the driving force behind most ad retargeting campaigns. Cookies can be used to essentially build a user profile based on someone's web activity and habits, and advertisers can leverage this profile to serve ads that align with a user's observed interests. They can also capture information about a user's browser configuration, location, and preferred language.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for:&lt;/strong&gt; Cookies are ideal when you want to serve a user ads aligned with their web browsing activity, or retarget them with ads for products they've demonstrated an interest in. Cookies can also be used to create a personalized experience for users on your website based on their previous interactions with you -- for example, you could create an abandoned cart email when users put items in their cart and then leave your website.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've gone over a few core terms related to ad targeting, let's take a deeper look at how ad targeting functions on a few of the biggest ad tracking platforms, and how you can use it to make your own ad campaigns stronger and more effective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DoubleClick Ad Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever noticed an ad for a product you viewed weeks ago following you around on the internet, it's likely the result of DoubleClick ad tracking. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/2727482?hl=en"&gt;DoubleClick&lt;/a&gt;, which was acquired by Google in 2008, is an ad management and ad serving platform that enables marketers to run ad campaigns across multiple channels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Online publishers use DoubleClick to essentially rent out ad space on their websites, and agencies and advertisers use the product to place ads on websites where their target audiences are spending time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Google &lt;a href="https://adexchanger.com/platforms/doubleclick-no-more-google-renames-its-ad-stack/"&gt;rebranded&lt;/a&gt; their DoubleClick products as Google Marketing Platform (formerly DoubleClick), Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords), and Google Ad Manager (formerly DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Google offers advertisers a number of different ad tracking options when they create campaigns on the platform -- most of which rely on the use of cookies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2839090?hl=en"&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, "Cookies themselves contain no personally identifiable information. Depending on the publisher’s and user’s settings, information associated with cookies used in advertising may be added to the user’s Google Account."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These generic cookies can collect information on the time and date you viewed particular ads, the specific web pages you were on when you viewed an ad, and your IP address -- which can help the cookie infer where you're located.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although the cookies contain no personally identifiable information, &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/google/2019/02/05/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking/"&gt;Google can combine&lt;/a&gt; the information it obtains via cookies with the personally identifiable information associated with your Google Account (which includes your browsing and search activity when you're logged into Google -- which, for most of us, is pretty much always).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Google leverages two main types of cookies: first-party and third-party.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-party cookies&lt;/strong&gt; are dropped (i.e., assigned to a specific user) by the owner of the website you're visiting. Information collected via first-party cookies can help publishers better understand your activity on their site and how ads are performing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party cookies&lt;/strong&gt; are dropped by an advertiser on a website where their ads are being displayed. These cookies send information back to advertisers about how their ad campaigns are performing across all the websites where their DoubleClick ads are being displayed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Adsense"&gt;11.1 million websites&lt;/a&gt; currently run ads as part of Google's AdSense network. If you visit a website within the network, the information collected via a DoubleClick ad tracking cookie will be pooled and leveraged by other websites and advertisers using AdSense.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This consolidation of cookie information results in an extremely rich pool of data for Google advertisers, as they can keep track of what ads you're served across millions of different websites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get started tracking ads with Google, you'll need to &lt;a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/"&gt;get a Google Marketing Platform account&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the size of your business and your particular needs, you'll choose either an enterprise account -- which can accommodate large ad campaigns across multiple websites and mediums -- or a small business account -- with ad tracking tools more focused and specialized for early company growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook Ad Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Advertisers on Facebook can leverage a number of different ad tracking strategies to optimize ads for their audience. Facebook's ad tracking pixel is one of the more common methods. It functions similarly to the basic tracking pixel we outlined above, and can be used to track the path someone takes from viewing an ad, to visiting your website, to purchasing a product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When an action takes place on a page where a tracking pixel has been set up, the pixel will "fire" and send that information back to your Facebook Events Manager account. Information collected via the tracking pixel can also be used in the creation of custom audiences for future ad campaigns.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, you could use data collected via a tracking pixel to create a custom ad audience targeting users who viewed a particular page on your website that implies purchase intent -- like a pricing page. We wrote an article that goes &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-pixel"&gt;deeper into how the tracking pixel functions&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn more about different uses and how to set it up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the Facebook pixel can offer advertisers valuable insights into how ads are influencing specific actions on their websites, it's not the only way to track ads on the social network.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another ad tracking option available to you is adding UTM parameters to links that appear on your ads. As we discussed above, tracking parameters use extra code on a URL to "fire" when a user loads the link. On Facebook, they can &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1016122818401732"&gt;be used&lt;/a&gt; in Ads Manager to better understand which ads you're running are driving which types of traffic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before hitting send, have you considered whether your subscribers will even get the opportunity to read your email?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No matter how legitimate of an email marketer you are, there are a host of things you may not even know about that can prevent your email from ever reaching someone's inbox. With more stringent laws and increasingly sophisticated spam filters, it's to your benefit to know everything that can affect your email's deliverability.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If steering clear of legal trouble isn't enough to convince you, squeezing more ROI out of your &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email"&gt;email marketing&lt;/a&gt; efforts certainly should. Take a look at the things you should absolutely &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; do in your email marketing if you want your messages to be successfully delivered, and the things you can proactively do to increase your rate of email deliverability.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The first step in improving email deliverability will be to run a test to see if you are encountering any issues. To learn more about email deliverability test tools, &lt;a href="#emailtest"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;29 Ways to Avoid Sending Spam Email &amp;amp; Improve Your Email Deliverability&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;What You Should &lt;em&gt;Never &lt;/em&gt;Do&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. Don't buy or rent email lists.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can legally rent and purchase lists of people who have agreed to email communications -- but &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/Why-Purchasing-Email-Lists-Is-Always-a-Bad-Idea.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;it's never a good idea.&lt;/a&gt; Not only is it a dirty email marketing tactic that goes against the Terms of Service for your email service provider, but these people don't actually know you -- and it's likely they won't even want &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; emails. In other words, there's a good change they'll mark you as spam. Plus, let's be honest ... high quality email addresses are never for sale.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. Don't scrape sites for email addresses.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Scraping websites for email addresses may seem like a fast way to build a contact list, but it's bad for your business -- not to mention illegal in many countries, including the United States, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-can-spam-ht"&gt;thanks to the CAN-SPAM Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. Don't email people who have bounced repeatedly.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hard bounces are the result of an invalid, closed, or non-existent email address, and these emails will never be successfully delivered. Bounce rates are one of the key factors internet service providers (ISPs) use to determine an email sender's reputation, so having too many hard bounces can cause them to &lt;span&gt;stop allowing your emails in folks' inboxes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Email deliverability is covered extensively in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/email-marketing-course"&gt;HubSpot's free email marketing certification course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, so check that out to learn more.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;4. Don't use all caps anywhere in your email or its subject line.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't yell at people. It's not nice. Using all caps in your subject line might get the recipients' attention, but probably not in a good way. Using all caps can really rub people the wrong way. It's annoying and can seem spammy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2014-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf"&gt;according to a study by the Radicati Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;more than 85% of respondents prefer an all-lowercase subject line to one in all caps. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using disruptive tactics like all caps to get people's attention, try personalizing your emails, establishing relevancy, and using catchy and delightful language. (&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/The-9-Must-Have-Components-of-Compelling-Email-Copy.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;Read this blog post on how to write compelling emails&lt;/a&gt; for more tips.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;5. Don't use exclamation points!!!!!&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that can make your subject line and/or email look unprofessional and spammy? Exclamation points -- especially a whole bunch of them in a row. And when &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/powerful-subject-line-stats-that-will-supercharge-your-open-rates#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;69% of email recipients&lt;/a&gt; report email as spam based solely on the subject line, &lt;/strong&gt;you'll want to stay away from triggers like this as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Plus, when you ask punctuation to do a word's job, it can really dilute your message. The next time you're tempted to use an exclamation point in an email (or anywhere, really), &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/exclamation-point-flowchart"&gt;use this flowchart, "Should I Use an Exclamation Point?"&lt;/a&gt;, as a gut check.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Don't use video, Flash, or JavaScript within your email.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By default, most email clients don't allow the ability to view rich media like Flash or video embeds. Instead, use an image of your video player (with a play button) that links to the rich media on a website page.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As for JavaScript and other dynamic scripts, even if a spam filter allows your email through, most email clients won't allow these scripts to function -- so avoid using them altogether.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;7. Don't embed forms in your emails.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Forms aren't supported in email across common email clients due to security risks. Instead, place &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-templates-free-download-ht"&gt;a call-to-action button&lt;/a&gt; or a link to &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34047/What-You-Can-and-Should-Ask-for-on-Your-Landing-Page-Forms.aspx"&gt;a landing page with a form&lt;/a&gt; in the body of your email.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(HubSpot customers: Learn how to add a call-to-action button to your emails in HubSpot &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cta-user-guide-v2/how-to-add-a-call-to-action-cta-to-an-email"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and how to create a form for your landing pages in HubSpot &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/landing-page-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-a-form-for-your-landing-page?_ga=1.206366099.1866822358.1456501228"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;8. Don't include attachments to your emails.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to send your recipients something like a PDF or a Word document, don't attach the file to the email -- otherwise your email could get blocked by spam filters. Instead, upload the attachment to your website and link to the file location in your email using &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-templates-free-download-ht"&gt;an effective call-to-action button&lt;/a&gt;. This'll minimize the chance of being blocked by spam filters &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; decrease the load time of your email.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(HubSpot users: &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/how-do-i-add-a-document-attachment-to-a-hubspot-email"&gt;HubSpot's attachment tool&lt;/a&gt; in the email editor automatically does this for you. Simply highlight a bit of text or an image and click the attachment icon, and HubSpot will turn that text or image into a link leading to that attachment.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;9. Don't use spam trigger words.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of easiest ways to avoid spam filters is by carefully choosing the words you use in your email's subject line. A good rule of thumb is this: If it sounds like something a used car salesman would say, it's probably a spam trigger word. Think "free," "guarantee," no obligation," and so on. (For more, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30684/The-Ultimate-List-of-Email-SPAM-Trigger-Words.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;look at this list of common spam trigger words&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using these trigger words, be creative, interesting, and informative -- without giving too much away. Some &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-email-subject-lines-that-get-prospects-to-open-read-and-respond#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;better ideas for subject lines&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;"Hi [name], [question]?"&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;"Did you get what you were looking for?"&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;"You are not alone."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;"Feeling blue? Like puppies?"&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;10. Don't use a red font when drafting your emails.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Same goes for using invisible text, i.e. a white font on top of a white background. These are common tricks that spammers use, so it's an instant red flag for spam filters.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, people don't like when marketers use irregular fonts, font sizes, and font colors at all in emails. In &lt;a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2014-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf"&gt;that same study by the Radicati Group&lt;/a&gt;, out of the top 10 objectionable email trends, four revolve around fonts. Over 60% of respondents considered it unacceptable for email marketers to use different font sizes, irregular fonts, and different font colors&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Nearly 70% of respondents prefer fonts to be one size.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;11. Don't forget to use spell check.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2014-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf"&gt;According to that Radicati Group study&lt;/a&gt;, 80% of all respondents find spelling and grammatical errors the most unacceptable email offense. But spelling mistakes aren't just unprofessional -- they're actually a spam trigger, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's easy for little spelling mistakes to slip by -- especially when you're self-editing. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/common-grammar-mistakes-list"&gt;Read this post to learn the most common spelling and grammar mistakes&lt;/a&gt; so you never make them again.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;12. Don't jam pack your email copy with keywords.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keyword-stuffing your emails means shoving as many keywords into your emails as you can. There's a reason Google give a lower rank to webpages that are stuffed with keywords -- and that's because it's harmful to user experience. No one wants to read content that's optimized for a robot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To make it more likely folks will open your emails and not mark them as spam, write your emails for humans, not robots. Copywriting that makes people want to take action is both simple and compelling. To make your writing sound more personable and relatable, use casual language, colloquial expressions, and even personal anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I love the example below from &lt;a href="https://www.turnstylecycle.com/"&gt;Turnstyle Cycle&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-examples-list"&gt;our roundup of 12 great email marketing examples&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;span&gt; The copy is beautiful in its simplicity. It's friendly, yet sincere -- especially with the following lines:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We know you are busy and would hate to see you miss out"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Please let us know if we can help accommodate in any way possible"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Feel free to give us a call - we want to help :)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Plus, they provided me with the exact details I needed to know -- a reminder of what I'd signed up for and when, the expiration date, and a phone number to reach them. Check it out:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/turnstyle-email-copy-example.png?width=583&amp;amp;height=648&amp;amp;name=turnstyle-email-copy-example.png" alt="turnstyle-email-copy-example.png" title="turnstyle-email-copy-example.png" width="583" height="648"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;13. Don't use an overwhelming number of images, or huge images.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using one large image as your entire email, or too many images in general, tends to end up in recipients' spam folders.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You'll also want to make your image file sizes as small as possible without losing their visual integrity to prevent long email load times. (If you're a HubSpot user, the email tool automatically compresses images in emails so they load faster. For non-HubSpot users, some good image compression tools include &lt;a href="https://compressor.io/"&gt;Compressor.io&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://compressjpeg.com/"&gt;Compressjpeg.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.jpegmini.com/"&gt;Jpegmini.com&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, Microsoft Outlook doesn't recognize background images, so you may want to avoid those and use a background color instead.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;What You &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; Do&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;14. Keep your email lists current and clean.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even if your list is entirely built on valid opt-ins, you are at risk of being branded a "spammer" if you don’t &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27111/3-Reasons-to-Practice-Good-Email-List-Hygiene.aspx?_ga=1.171877664.1866822358.1456501228#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;practice proper email hygiene&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because internet service providers (ISPs) base complaint rates on&lt;em&gt; active&lt;/em&gt; subscribers, not total subscribers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Also, expired email addresses can turn into SPAM traps, meaning that even if you acquired emails in a legitimate manner, the abandoned addresses that haven't engaged in years may have morphed into spam traps. Hitting even just one spam trap can cause deliverability problems.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Expired email addresses can also turn into unknown users (bounces). If you hit unknown accounts &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27111/3-Reasons-to-Practice-Good-Email-List-Hygiene.aspx?_ga=1.171877664.1866822358.1456501228#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;at a rate higher that 5%&lt;/a&gt;, then ISPs are going to see you as someone who has really bad email hygiene. The result? They'll make it harder for your emails to reach people's inboxes, and your overall sender reputation will definitely drop -- leading to even more trouble reaching people's inboxes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By keeping your email lists current and clean, you'll decrease the likelihood people will flag your emails as spam. You can identify inactive subscribers and expired email addresses with metrics such as opens, clicks, or website activity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;15. See if you can reengage inactive or infrequently active subscribers.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"Graymail" refers to email people technically opted in to receive, but don't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want, leading them to become less active or inactive altogether. Although it's not considered spam, sending graymail is problematic because it can hurt the deliverability of your email overall. Tipped off by low engagement rates, ISPs and inbox providers may deliver email from known-graymail senders straight to recipients' "junk" folders -- so the email technically gets sent (and can even appear to have been delivered), but it's not necessarily seen.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keep track of your inactive and infrequently active subscribers, and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33403/The-Email-Campaign-You-Need-to-Clean-Your-List-Re-Engage-Subscribers.aspx"&gt;develop re-engagement campaigns&lt;/a&gt; for contacts who have stopped engaging with your messages. For example, you could set conditions such as the length of time since their last form submission, website visit, or email click, triggering the email when it's been a while since a contact last engaged with you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In your workflow, you might try sending them an exclusive offer or coupon to get them excited about your company again. Or, you might ask them for feedback by sending out a quick survey to see what they would like to see in your emails. (&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32123/How-to-Use-Email-to-Re-Engage-Sleepy-Subscribers.aspx?_ga=1.160205245.1866822358.1456501228"&gt;Read this blog post for more ideas&lt;/a&gt; for launching an effective email re-engagement campaign.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;16. Do use double opt-in.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Double opt-in means that after someone subscribes to your email list, you send them a follow-up email with a confirmation link ensuring they actually want to receive email communications from you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Users that have to confirm that they want email communications from your company are the ones that will fully read and engage with the emails they receive from your business. When you use double opt-in, your email lists will be much more qualified and your subscribers much more engaged. (HubSpot customers: Learn how to set up double opt-in in HubSpot &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-set-up-double-opt-in"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;17. Ask your subscribers to add you to their address book.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Spam filters are more aggressive than ever -- so much so that sometimes, the emails people value and want to read &lt;em&gt;still &lt;/em&gt;end up in their spam boxes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But most spam filters allow you to whitelist a sender by adding their email address to their email's address book. When subscribers add you to their address book, spam filters will back off.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;18. You must include a clear unsubscribe link and a physical mailing address in your email footer.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Allowing people to unsubscribe is important for list hygiene because anyone receiving your emails should actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to receive them -- otherwise, you're just spamming them. But did you know that it's &lt;em&gt;illegal&lt;/em&gt; to not have a way for your recipients to easily unsubscribe in many countries, including the United States?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In your marketing emails, you must include a way for folks to unsubscribe from your email list, either by simply sending a reply email or by clicking no more than one level deep to reach a page from which they can unsubscribe. Which method you choose is entirely up to you, as long as the information is clear and easy to locate.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The most common place for these unsubscribe CTAs is in the footer of your email, so users tend to know to look for it there -- which makes for a better user experience. Here's an example from one of HubSpot's emails:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unsubscribe-1.png?width=690&amp;amp;height=149&amp;amp;name=unsubscribe-1.png" alt="unsubscribe-1.png" title="unsubscribe-1.png" width="690" height="149"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;In addition to the unsubscribe link, include a link to update subscriber preferences, which you can also see in the example above. That way, recipients can unsubscribe from just one type of email instead of all of them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;19. Honor your unsubscribes and remove them from your mailing list.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If someone unsubscribes, they must come off your email list. It's the law. This should go without saying. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-unsubscribe-pages#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;Check out this list of effective unsubscribe pages&lt;/a&gt; to make the unsubscribe process a little more delightful for recipients.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/email-marketing" title="email marketing software"&gt;email marketing software &lt;/a&gt;that integrates seamlessly with your CRM comes in handy -- because any unsubscribes are immediately processed and recorded in both the contact record and within the email software. (But if you're removing unsubscribed addresses from your list manually, make it a top priority to process that request.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;20. Use a familiar sender name.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because people are so inundated with SPAM, they hesitate to open email from unfamiliar senders. Make sure recipients can recognize you in your sender by using your brand name.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, send the email from a real person. Recipients are typically more likely to trust a personalized sender name and email address than a generic one. At HubSpot &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31634/A-B-Testing-in-Action-3-Real-Life-Marketing-Experiments.aspx" title="we've found"&gt;we found that &lt;/a&gt;that emails sent from "Maggie Georgieva, HubSpot" perform better in terms of open &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;clickthrough rate than emails sent from just "HubSpot." (HubSpot customers: Learn how to personalize the "From" name and email address &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/how-do-i-personalize-the-from-name-and-address-in-an-email"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;21. Include your recipient’s name in the "To:" field.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This way, spam filters know that you do, indeed, know your recipient. Plus, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34146/7-Excellent-Examples-of-Email-Personalization-in-Action.aspx"&gt;personalizing your emails&lt;/a&gt; around your contacts can also be vital to their engagement with your content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;22. Offer recipients both an HTML and a plain text version of your emails.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Plain text emails are simply emails void of any formatting, while HTML (HyperText Markup Language) emails use formatting that let you &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32984/Feast-Your-Eyes-on-These-9-Examples-of-Beautiful-Email-Marketing.aspx"&gt;design more beautiful emails&lt;/a&gt; with attractive visual components. By offering both a plain text &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;HTML version of a single email, you're not only indicating your legitimacy to ISPs, but you're also making your emails more reader-friendly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Most email marketing tools will let you easily create plain-text versions within their email editor, so take those five extra minutes to create and optimize the plain-text version of your email. (HubSpot customers: Learn how to create a plain-text email in HubSpot &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/Email/How-do-I-generate-a-plain-text-email?_ga=1.127182221.1866822358.1456501228"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure the HTML version is properly coded: If there are broken tags in your HTML, the email provider and users might mark it as spam.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;23. Allow people to view your email in a web browser.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even after every step is taken to assure proper email design, an email client can &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; display an email poorly. Include a link in every email to view the email as a web page. (HubSpot customers: Learn how to do this easily in HubSpot &lt;a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/Email/How-do-I-create-a-webpage-version-of-an-email?_ga=1.138276272.1866822358.1456501228"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/View-As-A-Web-Page-Link-1.png?width=690&amp;amp;height=135&amp;amp;name=View-As-A-Web-Page-Link-1.png" alt="View-As-A-Web-Page-Link-1.png" title="View-As-A-Web-Page-Link-1.png" width="690" height="135"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;24. Include alt text in your email images.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/dev-resources/will-it-work/image-blocking/"&gt;Many email clients block images&lt;/a&gt; by default. This means that when someone opens your email, the images won't load unless they click a button to show them or change their default settings. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-add-alt-text-to-email-images-ht?_ga=1.206430483.1866822358.1456501228#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;Adding alt text to your images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-add-alt-text-to-email-images-ht?_ga=1.206430483.1866822358.1456501228#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;helps recipients understand your message even if they can't see the images.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is especially bad if you use an image as a call-to-action. Without alt text, a "turned off" image will look like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388144872-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_10.02.52_AM.png?t=1462821859431" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you add alt text to the image, recipients will still know where to click to complete the action:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="This is what an image with alt-text looks like." src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-385628288-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_9.58.55_AM.png?t=1462821859431" alt="This is what an image with alt-text looks like." style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can either edit the alt text in your email tool's rich text editor (just right-click the image and edit away), or you can manually enter it in the HTML editor of your email tool like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body" style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"&gt;&amp;lt;a href="&lt;strong&gt;HTTP://YOURLINKHERE.COM&lt;/strong&gt;"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="&lt;strong&gt;YOUR CTA BUTTON IMAGE SOURCE HERE.JPG&lt;/strong&gt;" alt-text="&lt;strong&gt;YOUR ALT-TEXT GOES HERE&lt;/strong&gt;"/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;25. Keep your emails short and sweet.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Too much copy is another red flag for spam filters. Not only that, but people generally like concise emails better. Everyone's busy and their inbox is already full, so why make things worse?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="graf--p"&gt;One of the best ways to keep things short and sweet is to write like a human. Writing your email like you were talking to someone in real life makes it feel much more approachable and relevant. (&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/The-9-Must-Have-Components-of-Compelling-Email-Copy.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q"&gt;Read this blog post on how to write compelling emails&lt;/a&gt; for more tips.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class="graf--p"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;If you do have to write a lengthier email, then break it up into multiple paragraphs. Giving visual breaks and composing the email with a clear introduction, middle, and conclusion will make it much easier on your reader.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;26. Test your emails before sending them.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of email clients out there these days that email marketers have to consider when creating emails. On top of that, we have to consider mobile users, too -- after all, &lt;a href="https://litmus.com/blog/53-of-emails-opened-on-mobile-outlook-opens-decrease-33"&gt;53% of people&lt;/a&gt; read email on their mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It turns out &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-emails-different-email-clients"&gt;each of these clients displays emails differently&lt;/a&gt;. While it may be time-consuming to test out your emails for &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;email clients, you'll want to test them for the ones your audience uses the most. According to &lt;a href="https://emailclientmarketshare.com/"&gt;Litmus' research of 1.06 billion email opens&lt;/a&gt;, the top five email clients are:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;Apple iPhone's Mail app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt; (28% of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;users)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;Gmail &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;(16% of users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;Apple iPad's Mail app &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;(11% of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;users)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;Google Android's Mail app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt; (9% of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;users)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;Outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt; (9% of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;users)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your email marketing tool lets you, go ahead and preview what your email looks like in different email clients and devices that are popular with your audience. (HubSpot customers: Use our &lt;a href="https://help.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/Can-I-preview-my-email-across-different-clients"&gt;Preview in other inboxes&lt;/a&gt; feature to send a test email and see how the design of your email looks in each email client.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You should also send out a test version of your email before you send out the real deal to ensure it's working properly. (HubSpot customers: Learn how to test your emails &lt;a href="https://help.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/Email/How-do-I-send-a-test-email"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;27. Get an email sender accreditation from a third party.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sender accreditation is a third-party process of verifying email senders and requiring them to follow certain usage guidelines. In return, you'll be listed in a trusted listing that ISPs reference to allow certain emails to bypass email filters.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;28. Monitor the reputation of your sender's IP address.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your emails' deliverability depends largely on your IP address' reputation. If you're sending email from an IP address with a poor reputation, your emails are far less likely to be successfully delivered to senders' inboxes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/" title="DNSstuff.com"&gt;DNSstuff.com&lt;/a&gt; lets you check on whether or not you are a blacklisted sender -- something many unlucky email marketers aren't even aware of.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;29. Always stay up-to-date on changes in email sending laws, ISP behavior, and spam filter technology.&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Email marketing is constantly evolving, and staying in the know helps ensure you’re always following best practices -- and the law. Responsible and legitimate email marketers make a point of regularly reading up on email sending laws, ISP behavior, and spam filter technology.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for more information, check in with your company's legal department or a trusted lawyer to ensure you're staying within the boundaries of the law. &lt;span&gt;Want to learn more about email deliverability? Watch class &lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;six&lt;/span&gt; in our HubSpot Academy's &lt;a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/email-marketing-course"&gt;Email Marketing Certification course&lt;/a&gt; taught by HubSpot's &lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;ost M&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aster, Tom Monaghan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Email Deliverability Test Tools&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If your email platform doesn't offer enough deliverability analytics, we suggest using other tools that can help you test for delivery issues before your message goes out to your mailing list.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are three free tools that you can use:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/"&gt;Mail-Tester.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Every time someone visits Mail-Tester.com, they'll see a treehouse with a auto-generated email address listed on it that changes every time you visit the site. You can send your email to the address listed, then click "Check Your Score." Mail-Tester will then give you a free email deliverability score based on the email that was sent to the unique email address.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The software will analyze the text in the message,&lt;span&gt; your mail server, and IP to determine if there are any deliverability issues. Free users can access the report for seven days. You can also subscribe for unlimited email tests and reports that last for 30 days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://spamcheck.postmarkapp.com/"&gt;Spamcheck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Spamcheck is a simple and free tool that allows you to paste a plain text message into a text box and analyze it for any language that might trigger spam filtering.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After placing the text and clicking "Check your score," the software will give you a score out of 10 based on what's included and not included in the email body. For a bad email, it might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Spamcheck.jpg?width=1247&amp;amp;name=Spamcheck.jpg" alt="Spamcheck Score" width="1247" style="width: 1247px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/deliverability"&gt;MxToolBox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;MxToolBox allows you to test your email deliverability by sending a test email to &lt;a href="mailto:ping@tools.mxtoolbox.com"&gt;ping@tools.mxtoolbox.com&lt;/a&gt;. This email address will reply to the email with a linked call to action that says "View your full Deliverability Report." You can then click on the CTA to see a deliverability score and information about what might stopping your email from going into inboxes. If you want to see your result later on, but no longer have the reply email, you can search for the result using your email address on &lt;a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/deliverability"&gt;the MxToolBox site&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 9 Best Cover Letter Examples: What They Got Right</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cover-letter-examples</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cover-letter-examples" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/best%20cover%20letter%20examples.jpg" alt="best cover letter examples" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it: A job search is, typically, anything but fun.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as if it carries its own five stages of grief. At first, there’s denial of its demoralizing nature. Then comes the anger over either radio silence or rejection from prospective employers. Of course, there’s bargaining -- “I promise to never complain about work again, if I can find a new job!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it: A job search is, typically, anything but fun.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as if it carries its own five stages of grief. At first, there’s denial of its demoralizing nature. Then comes the anger over either radio silence or rejection from prospective employers. Of course, there’s bargaining -- “I promise to never complain about work again, if I can find a new job!”&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;That’s often followed by depression, and the idea that one is simply just unhireable. Then, there’s acceptance: “This is awful, but I have to keep trying, anyway.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But we have good news. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to have a little fun with your job search -- and maybe even make yourself a better candidate in the process. The magic, it turns out, could be in your cover letter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-hiring-summer-19?utm_source=blog"&gt;P.S.: &lt;span&gt;Think you have what it takes to join the HubSpot Marketing Team? (We do!) Apply now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It may be true that only &lt;a href="https://www.jobvite.com/jobvite-news-and-reports/2017-job-seeker-nation-survey-finding-fault-lines-american-workforce/"&gt;26% of recruiters have deemed cover letters important&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn't mean yours has to contribute to that statistic. In fact, it might be that cover letters are deemed insignificant because so few of them stand out. Here's an opportunity for you to exercise your creativity at the earliest stage of the recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Personalization, after all, goes beyond replacing the title and company name in each letter you send to recruiters.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What does that look like in practice, and how can you make your cover letter stand out? We found six examples from job seekers who decided to do things a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Some of these cover letters contain real company names and NSFW language that we've covered up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Best Cover Letter Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. The Cover Letter That Explains 'Why,' Not Just 'How'&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already covered the importance of addressing &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; you’ll best execute a certain role in your cover letter. But there’s another question you might want to answer: Why the heck do you want to work here?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples"&gt;The Muse&lt;/a&gt;, a career guidance site, says that it’s often best to lead with the why -- especially if it makes a good story. We advise against blathering on and on, but a brief tale that illuminates your desire to work for that particular employer can really make you stand out.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Why%20Example.png?width=524&amp;amp;name=Why%20Example.png" alt="Why Example.png" width="524" title="Why Example.png" style="width: 524px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/31-attentiongrabbing-cover-letter-examples"&gt;The Muse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another instance of the power of personalization. The author of this cover letter clearly has a passion for this prospective employer -- the Chicago Cubs -- and if she’s lying about it, well, that probably would eventually be revealed in an interview.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your story is nonfiction, and relatable according to each job. While we love a good tale of childhood baseball games, an introduction like this one probably wouldn’t be fitting in a cover letter for, say, a software company. But a story of how the hours you spent playing with DOS games as a kid led to your passion for coding? Sure, we’d find that fitting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’re really passionate about a particular job opening, think about where that deep interest is rooted. Then, tell your hiring manager about it in a few sentences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. The 'We're Meant for Each Other' Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This cover letter example is a special one because it was submitted to us here at HubSpot. What does the letter do well? It makes a connection with us before we've even met the letter's author.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/we're%20meant%20for%20each%20other%20cover%20letter%20example%20(1).png" alt="We're meant for each other cover letter submitted to HubSpot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"Content Marketing Certified" indicates the applicant has taken the content marketing certification course in our HubSpot Academy (you can &lt;a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/content-marketing-training"&gt;take the same course here&lt;/a&gt;). Our "records" indicate he/she did indeed give an interview with us before -- &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; was a HubSpot customer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The cover letter sang references to a relationship we didn't even know we had with the candidate.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The letter ends with a charming pitch for why, despite him/her not getting hired previously, our interests complement each other this time around.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(Yes, the applicant was hired).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Cover Letter with H.E.A.R.T.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HubSpot has a lot of H.E.A.R.T. -- Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable, Transparent. Our &lt;a href="/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx?_ga=2.257739915.122841317.1562677793-527251855.1560789477"&gt;Culture Code&lt;/a&gt; is the foundation of the company's culture, the driving force behind our mission to &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/our-story?_ga=2.257739915.122841317.1562677793-527251855.1560789477"&gt;help millions grow better&lt;/a&gt;, and serves as the scaffolding for our hiring practices. Recruiters at HubSpot look for applicants that demonstrate how they embody the Culture Code and job description, paying extra attention to cover letters that are &lt;i&gt;super&lt;/i&gt; custom to HubSpot.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In another HubSpot submission, a HubSpot applicant writes about how she found out about HubSpot, why she likes the company, and how her professional experience aligns with H.E.A.R.T.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Best-cover-letter-example.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;name=Best-cover-letter-example.jpg" alt="Best-cover-letter-example" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HubSpot's recruiting team was impressed with her dedication to the company and how she went beyond what was asked for by link her portfolio in her closing paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Short Cover Letter Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. The Short-and-Sweet Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, David Silverman penned an article for &lt;i&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/i&gt; titled, “&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2009/06/the-best-cover-letter"&gt;The Best Cover Letter I Ever Received.&lt;/a&gt;” That letter contained three complete sentences, as follows:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/short-and-sweet.png?width=680&amp;amp;name=short-and-sweet.png" alt="Short and sweet cover letter example" width="680" title="short-and-sweet.png" style="width: 680px;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2009/06/the-best-cover-letter"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One might argue that this particular letter is less than outstanding. It’s brief, to say the least, and the author doesn’t go into a ton of detail about what makes him or her qualified for the job in question. But that’s what Silverman likes about it -- the fact that the applicant only included the pieces of information that would matter the most to the recipient.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;“The writer of this letter took the time to think through what would be relevant to me,” writes Silverman. “Instead of scattering lots of facts in hopes that one was relevant, the candidate offered up an opinion as to which experiences I should focus on.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you apply for a job, start by determining two things:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Who might oversee the role -- that’s often included in the description, under “reports to.” Address your letter to that individual.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Figure out what problems this role is meant to solve for that person. Then, concisely phrase in your cover letter how and why your experience can and will resolve those problems.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The key here is research -- by looking into who you’ll be reporting to and learning more about that person’s leadership style, you’ll be better prepared to tailor your cover letter to focus on how you provide solutions for her. Not sure how to learn more about a leader’s personality? Check out any content she shares on social media, or use &lt;a href="https://growthbot.org/"&gt;Growthbot’s&lt;/a&gt; Personality Profile feature.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Insert incredible compelling writing here&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. The Bare Bones Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In today's job market, cover letters aren't always necessary. Even though many recruiters won't ask for or even read them, cover letters can still be effective and convey personality to a reader. Writing a strong cover letter can help you better convey your interest in the position and company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This template from &lt;a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/best-cover-letters-a-z-list-of-examples-2060172"&gt;The Balance Careers&lt;/a&gt; puts together the essential components of a short cover letter: excitement about the position, your qualifications, and a call-to-action for the recruiter to follow up with you. Combining these central aspects in a well-written, compelling narrative will go a long way in convincing readers to hire you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/best%20short%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg?width=492&amp;amp;name=best%20short%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg" alt="best short cover letter example" width="492" style="width: 492px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/best-cover-letters-a-z-list-of-examples-2060172"&gt;The Balance Careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Creative Cover Letter Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Brutally Honest Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, there are the occasions when your future boss might appreciate honesty -- in its purest form. Livestream CEO Jesse Hertzberg, by his own admission, is one of those people, which might be why he called this example “&lt;a href="http://titleneeded.com/blog/the-best-cover-letter"&gt;the best cover letter&lt;/a&gt;” (which he received while he was with Squarespace):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brutally%20honest%20cover%20letter%20example.png?width=562&amp;amp;height=405&amp;amp;name=brutally%20honest%20cover%20letter%20example.png" width="562" height="405" style="width: 562px;" alt="Brutally honest cover letter example"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://titleneeded.com/blog/the-best-cover-letter"&gt;Title Needed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As Hertzberg says in the blog post elaborating on this excerpt -- it’s not appropriate for every job or company. But if you happen to be sure that the corporate culture of this prospective employer gets a kick out of a complete lack of filter, then there’s a chance that the hiring manager might appreciate your candor.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;“Remember that I'm reading these all day long,” Hertzberg writes. “You need to quickly convince me I should keep reading. You need to stand out.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. The Straw (Wo)man Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When I was in the throes of my own job search and reached one of the later stages, a friend said to me, “For the next job you apply for, you should just submit a picture of yourself a stick figure that somehow represents you working there.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Et voilà:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg?width=432&amp;amp;name=AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg" alt="Funny illustration cover letter by Amanda Zantal-Wiener" width="432" title="AZWstrawCoverLetter.jpg" style="width: 432px;"&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I never did end up working for the recipient of this particular piece of art, but it did result in an interview. Again, be careful where you send a cover letter like this one -- if it doesn’t match the company’s culture, it might be interpreted as you not taking the opportunity seriously.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to pair it with a little bit of explanatory text, too. For example, when I submitted this picture-as-a-cover letter, I also wrote, “Perhaps I took the ‘sense of humor’ alluded to in your job description a bit too seriously.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. The Overconfident Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that I considered leaving out this example. It’s rife with profanity, vanity, and arrogance. But maybe, in some settings, that’s the right way to do a cover letter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/23/epic-cover-letter_n_865569.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this note as an example of how to “get noticed” and “get hired for your dream job”:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/epic%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg?width=479&amp;amp;height=647&amp;amp;name=epic%20cover%20letter%20example.jpg" width="479" height="647" style="width: 479px;" alt="Overconfident cover letter example"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/23/epic-cover-letter_n_865569.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: if the Aviary cited in this letter is the same Aviary I researched upon discovering it, then, well, I’m not sure this tone was the best approach. I read the company’s blog and looked at the careers site, and neither one indicates that the culture encourages this -- or lowercasing proper nouns like "Google," for which I personally cannot forgive the applicant ...&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/adobe-acquires-aviary/"&gt;Aviary was acquired by Adobe in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and this letter was written in 2011. So while it’s possible that the brand was a bit more relaxed at that time, we wouldn’t suggest submitting a letter with that tone to the company today. That’s not to say it would go unappreciated elsewhere -- &lt;a href="https://velocitypartners.com/blog/how-to-use-swear-words-in-your-content-marketing/"&gt;Doug Kessler&lt;/a&gt; frequently discusses the marketers and brands that value colorful language, for example.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The point is, this example further illustrates the importance of research. Make sure you understand the culture of the company to which you’re applying before you send a completely unfiltered cover letter -- if you don’t, there’s a good chance it’ll completely miss the mark.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. The Interactive Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When designer Rachel McBee applied for a job with the Denver Broncos, she didn’t just write a personalized cover letter -- she designed an entire digital, interactive microsite:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="http://www.pondertart.com/broncos/"&gt;Rachel McBee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This cover letter -- if you can even call it that -- checks off all of the boxes we’ve discussed here in a remarkable way. It concisely addresses and organizes what many hiring managers hope to see in any cover letter: how her skills lend themselves to the role, why she wants the job, and how to contact her.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;She even includes a “traditional” body of text at the bottom, with a form that allows the reader to easily get in touch with her.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Take Cover&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to add a sixth stage to the job search: experimentation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In today’s competitive landscape, it’s so easy to feel defeated, less-than-good-enough, or like giving up your job search. But don’t let the process become so monotonous. Have fun discovering the qualitative data we’ve discussed here -- then, have even more by getting creative with your cover letter composition.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We certainly can’t guarantee that every prospective employer will respond positively -- or at all -- to even the most unique, compelling cover letter. But the one that’s right for you will. That’s why it’s important &lt;i&gt;not to copy these examples&lt;/i&gt;. That defeats the purpose of personalization.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So get creative. And, by the way -- &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/jobs?_ga=2.231244447.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541"&gt;we’re hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ultimate Guide to B2B Marketing in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-marketing</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-marketing" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/b2b-marketing.jpg" alt="b2b-marketing" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Effective marketing is difficult to get right. Between creative demands, budget limits, and channel decisions, marketers have a lot to juggle when developing their marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Effective marketing is difficult to get right. Between creative demands, budget limits, and channel decisions, marketers have a lot to juggle when developing their marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The biggest determinant of effective marketing, however, is your &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not properly targeting your buyer persona, your promotions and advertisements will likely fall on deaf ears. You might as well not be marketing at all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Where target audiences vary the most, though, is between &lt;strong&gt;individual consumers and businesses&lt;/strong&gt;. Some companies serve individual shoppers, while others cater to companies and organizations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Marketing to businesses is &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; than marketing to individual consumers. That’s why an entirely different marketing method — B2B marketing — exists, and that’s why we built this guide. By the end of this article, you’ll have a better understanding of B2B marketing, the most effective B2B marketing strategies, and how you can tap into and convert your business audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HubSpot is an example of a company that engages in B2B marketing. HubSpot’s customers are other businesses, not individual consumers. Therefore, all of our marketing efforts can be classified as B2B.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;B2B vs B2C Marketing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/differences-b2c-b2b-marketing"&gt;B2B and B2C (business-to-consumer) marketing&lt;/a&gt; are very different. B2B and B2C marketing differ in their respective strategies and applications, as well as &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-b2c-content-marketing"&gt;in their audiences and how they communicate to them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B2B marketing&lt;/strong&gt; targets the needs, interests, and challenges of individuals who are making purchases on behalf of, or for, their organization (rather than for themselves), thus making the &lt;em&gt;organization&lt;/em&gt; the customer. Here are a few examples of B2B companies:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A coworking space that leases office spaces to remote teams and freelancers (like &lt;a href="https://www.wework.com/"&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;An on-demand order fulfillment, warehousing, and screen printing service (like &lt;a href="https://www.printful.com/"&gt;Printful&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A marketing software company that sells social media management tools, lead generation software, and other marketing tools to businesses and organizations (like &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing"&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B2C marketing&lt;/strong&gt; targets the needs, interests, and challenges of individual consumers who are making purchases on behalf of, or for, themselves, thus making the &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; the customer. Here are a few examples of B2C companies:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;An e-commerce company that sells office supplies to remote or self-employed individuals (like &lt;a href="https://www.poppin.com/"&gt;Poppin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A store that sells t-shirts and other clothing and accessories (like &lt;a href="https://www.target.com/"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;A music platform that sells streaming subscriptions (like &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this chart comparing B2B and B2C customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt; 
 &lt;tbody&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;for b2b marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;for b2c marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers are focused on ROI, efficiency, and expertise.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers are seeking deals and entertainment (which means marketing needs to be more &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase Motivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers are driven by logic and financial incentive.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers are driven by emotion.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers want to be educated (which is where &lt;a href="#b2b-content-marketing"&gt;B2B content marketing&lt;/a&gt; comes in).&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers appreciate education but don’t always need it to make a purchase decision.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers like (if not prefer) to work with account managers and salespeople.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers like to make purchases directly.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Involved in Purchase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers often have to confer with decision makers and other members of their chain of command before making a purchase decision.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers rarely need to confer with others before making a purchase decision.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchase Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers make purchases for long-term solutions, resulting in a longer sales cycle, longer contracts, and longer relationships with companies.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td style="width: 33.3333%;"&gt;Customers aren’t necessarily looking for long-term solutions or long-term relationships.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As much as they differ, though, B2B and B2C also intersect in many ways. While Poppin sells office supplies to remote or self-employed individuals, they also design corporate office spaces and branded supplies. On the flip side, Printful not only offers order fulfillment and warehousing to businesses; they also fill e-commerce printing orders for individuals.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As distinct as the B2B and B2C marketing audiences can be, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/b2c-campaigns-b2b-marketers-learn"&gt;B2B marketers can always learn from B2C campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;B2B Marketing Strategies&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As I said above, marketing depends on its audience. While B2B and B2C marketing vary, not every piece of B2B marketing material is alike, either.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we’ll talk about various &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-customer-marketing"&gt;B2B marketing strategies&lt;/a&gt; you can implement to reach your &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; business audience. Before we dive in, though, make sure you understand the B2B &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey"&gt;buyer’s journey&lt;/a&gt;. Take note of how each of these stages may affect your marketing strategies and how you implement them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-buyers-journey-hubspot.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=b2b-marketing-buyers-journey-hubspot.png" alt="b2b-marketing-buyers-journey-hubspot" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;B2B Email Marketing&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Email marketing is a tried and true method of reaching both individual consumers and business customers. Did you know that &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats"&gt;93% of B2B marketers&lt;/a&gt; use email? Are you one of them? You should be. Emails lead to engagement which turns subscribers into leads … and then &lt;em&gt;customers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-guide-to-optimizing-email-marketing-for-conversions?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase"&gt;Download our guide to optimizing email marketing for conversions and learn how to grow your email list, ensure deliverability, and increase &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-guide-to-optimizing-email-marketing-for-conversions"&gt;engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/free-guide-to-optimizing-email-marketing-for-conversions"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unlike B2C customers who respond best to emotions and entertainment, B2B customers look for logic and positive ROI. Essentially, they’re asking themselves, &lt;em&gt;How can your business help my business grow?&lt;/em&gt; Because of this, your email marketing must consistently resonate with your business customers and focus on things that matter to them — like time, money, and resources.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Email marketing is also a powerful vehicle for sharing your brand’s content. &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats"&gt;83% of B2B companies&lt;/a&gt; use email newsletters as part of their content marketing program, and 40% of B2B marketers say these newsletters are &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; critical to their content marketing success.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With the constant barrage of emails flooding our inboxes today, it’s more important than ever to create and send out effective marketing emails.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;B2B Email Marketing Best Practices&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write enticing subject lines.&lt;/strong&gt; Think about your email subject lines as a Netflix trailer — if you can’t hook your audience with a two-minute clip (or, in this case, a few dozen characters), don’t expect them to open and watch (or read) the whole thing. We recommend spending almost as much time on your email subject lines as you do on the emails themselves.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stick to one call-to-action (CTA) per email.&lt;/strong&gt; If you think the number of emails you receive is a lot, take a look at the &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;CTAs in those emails&lt;/a&gt; … some are packed with two, three, and sometimes up to 10 different CTAs. Don’t make this mistake, which can leave your recipients’ heads spinning, asking “What should I click on first?” and ultimately clicking on &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. With one CTA per email, you allow your audience to focus on your email content and ultimately one action … a welcome reprieve from today’s frequent decision-making and analysis paralysis.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segment your email to reach the most relevant audience. &lt;/strong&gt;Not every email you send will be appropriate for everyone on your list. Your subscribers may be at different stages of the buyer’s journey or be seeking different solutions. That’s where &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32848/Why-List-Segmentation-Matters-in-Email-Marketing.aspx"&gt;email list segmentation&lt;/a&gt; comes into play. Not only does this help you relate to your audience better, but it gives your emails that personal feel that says “Hey, I’m listening and I know what you’d like to see.” Consumers prefer email quality over quantity anytime.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure your email designs are responsive.&lt;/strong&gt; Over 80% of email users access their inbox on their phones, and emails that don’t show up correctly on mobile devices are often &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;deleted in three seconds&lt;/a&gt;. Ouch. Don’t let your email be one of those.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t be afraid of the cold email.&lt;/strong&gt; As uncomfortable as it is, the right email can convert new customers — like this &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/the-cold-email-template-that-won-16-new-b2b-customers"&gt;cold sales email that won 16 new B2B customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&#x1f449;&#x1f3fc;&lt;strong&gt;HubSpot Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: You can’t send marketing emails without any recipients — these people make up your lists. There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32028/25-Clever-Ways-to-Grow-Your-Email-Marketing-List.aspx"&gt;easy ways to grow your email list&lt;/a&gt;. Begin with opt-in forms on your website homepage, About page, and blog. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms"&gt;HubSpot’s Free Form Builder tool&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;B2B Digital Marketing&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Every business, whether B2B or B2C should have a digital presence — which is comprised of paid ads, search engine optimization, a website, and any other place your B2B company is active online. Let’s walk through a handful of tactics that can strengthen your B2B digital marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;Define your target audience&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A strong B2B digital marketing strategy starts with defining your target audience, or &lt;a href="/marketing/buyer-persona-research"&gt;buyer persona&lt;/a&gt;. This demographic and psychographic information will inform almost every other marketing activity thereafter, ensuring your content and digital material is absorbed by the right eyes and ears (and that no resources go to waste on your end).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;Create your website&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, digital marketing can’t quite function without an informative, engaging website. Over &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/81-shoppers-conduct-online-research-making-purchase-infographic/"&gt;80% of buyers&lt;/a&gt; visit a website before making a purchase. Moreover, since the typical B2B sales cycle often involves many key players (such as &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/identify-sales-prospects-influencers-decision-makers-ht"&gt;gatekeepers, decision makers&lt;/a&gt;, and other folks who have to buy into a purchase), websites are easy, straightforward ways for influencers to share information about your product or service.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;Optimize your digital presence&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your website needs to be more than informative and engaging, though … it needs to be discoverable. You can do this with &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33655/a-step-by-step-guide-to-flawless-on-page-seo-free-template.aspx"&gt;on-page SEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-seo"&gt;technical SEO&lt;/a&gt; tactics. These include everything from image alt-text and meta descriptions (what your visitors can see) to structured data and site speed (what your visitors can’t see). &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6487/The-ABCs-of-Off-Page-SEO-Tactics.aspx"&gt;Off-page SEO&lt;/a&gt; is also at play here, which refers to external linking strategies and social sharing — SEO tactics that take place &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; your website.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;Run PPC campaigns&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Finally, round out your digital presence with &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc"&gt;pay-per-click (PPC) advertising&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to get your content and brand in front of new audiences via search engines and other advertising platforms. I recommend maximizing your PPC investment by advertising more than your specific products or services — such as your brand personality, blog or social media content, or company tagline.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The best way to see an ROI from your paid ads is by 1) incorporating your buyer persona data and 2) boosting content that they can relate to. For example, it’s highly unlikely a brand new consumer who’s never heard of you is searching for your exact product. They may be searching for a location-based solution or product feature. To reach the greatest number of potential customers, pay to target relevant categories within your brand vs. promoting your product or services.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;B2B Content Marketing&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about how B2B customers are focused on expertise, driven by logic, and desire to be educated. What better marketing tool to satisfy these priorities than B2B content marketing?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whereas a traditional PR marketing strategy interrupts a consumer’s day-to-day with promotional material, a content marketing strategy adds valuable information and informs the consumer — which is precisely what B2B customers are looking for. Not to mention that content marketing supports SEO efforts, which involves &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-statistics"&gt;anticipating what your audience is searching for&lt;/a&gt;, helping them discover your website and content … and potentially converting them to customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/b2b-vs-b2c-content-lessons?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase"&gt;Download our free guide and learn what topics convert at the highest rate with insight from 175,000 B2B &amp;amp; B2C blog posts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/b2b-vs-b2c-content-lessons"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://b2bprblog.marxcommunications.com/b2bpr/top-b2b-pr-mistakes-to-avoid?utm_content=10778068&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=Webbiquity.com"&gt;80% of business decision makers&lt;/a&gt; prefer to get information from an article than an ad. Knowing this, I’d say you should be putting the same (if not more) resources into your content marketing than your traditional advertising strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because the B2B buyer’s journey is slightly different than the B2C buyer’s journey (which has shorter sales cycles and fewer decision makers involved), the content you create for your B2B content marketing strategy may vary more than the content you’ve seen as a consumer yourself, as illustrated in the below graphic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-content-for-the-buyers-journey-graphic.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=b2b-marketing-content-for-the-buyers-journey-graphic.png" alt="b2b-marketing-content-for-the-buyers-journey-graphic" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Before you start creating content, though, I recommend creating a &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/47/engineering-blog-readership-7-ways-to-drive-prospects-to-your-small-business.aspx"&gt;business blog&lt;/a&gt;. (Don’t worry, &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/blog-readers"&gt;growing your blog readership&lt;/a&gt; is easier than you think.) Your blog will house all the content you create and serve as a home-base for readers to visit and subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;B2B Social Media Marketing&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that &lt;a href="https://www.idg.com/blog/5-statistics-will-change-view-b2b-buyers-journey/"&gt;75% of B2B buyers and 84% of C-Suite executives&lt;/a&gt; use social media when making a purchase? That’s right — social media marketing isn’t just for brands targeting individual consumers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many B2B companies struggle with social media marketing, though. It can be harder to use social media to connect with business customers, especially because (as we mentioned above) there’s typically a lengthier sales cycle and longer chain of command.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32765/how-b2b-marketers-can-succeed-on-the-6-big-social-networks.aspx"&gt;B2B social media marketing&lt;/a&gt; might not be where you convert the greatest number of leads, and that’s OK. It likely comes into play near the beginning of your customers’ buyer’s journeys.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Social media is a powerful tool for building brand awareness, giving your company an online personality, and humanizing your business — all very powerful factors when it comes to marketing and connecting with potential customers. Like email marketing, social media is also a highly effective channel for sharing your content and enhancing your brand expertise, the latter of which we know B2B customers appreciate.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase"&gt;Overwhelmed by social media? Spend more time connecting with your followers with our time-saving suite of social tools.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While your social media accounts might not convert as frequently as your content or email marketing, they’re just as important. In this case, followers are just as valuable — you never know when they might convert to leads or customers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&#x1f449;&#x1f3fc; &lt;strong&gt;HubSpot Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Why? Content shared by employee advocates &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/employee-advocate-mobilize-your-team-share-your-brand-content"&gt;receives over eight times more engagement&lt;/a&gt; than content shared by brands. So, involve your employees in your B2B social media marketing strategy. Encourage them to create their own social media channels and share about life at your company. Create a culture account (&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/"&gt;like our @HubSpotLife Instagram&lt;/a&gt;) to show what’s going on at work, not just what you’re selling. You never know — this might attract strong talent, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-social-media-employee-engagement-hubspot-life-instagram.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=b2b-marketing-social-media-employee-engagement-hubspot-life-instagram.png" alt="b2b-marketing-social-media-employee-engagement-hubspot-life-instagram" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;B2B Marketing Examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A B2B marketing approach that works for one business may not work for another, but that’s not to say we can’t learn something from the pros. Here are four &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/b2b-content-marketing-examples"&gt;B2B marketing examples&lt;/a&gt; of businesses who did it right.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Email Marketing: Mattermark, Raise the Bar Newsletter&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattermark.com/category/raise-the-bar/"&gt;Raise the Bar&lt;/a&gt; is a daily digest newsletter from Mattermark that features insights from leaders in sales, marketing, and growth engineering. It’s hand-picked by Mattermark executives and easy to scan, which is valuable in a world of elaborate, complicated newsletters and daily digests.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-email-marketing-mattermark-raise-the-bar.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=b2b-marketing-email-marketing-mattermark-raise-the-bar.png" alt="b2b-marketing-email-marketing-mattermark-raise-the-bar" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of B2B email marketing because Mattermark takes the time to educate their subscribers without blatantly selling to them. This action builds trust with their audience while also equipping them with everything they need to know to make a purchase and become a paying customer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Digital Marketing: Maersk, Website Homepage&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly impossible to know the intent of everyone who lands on your website, but &lt;a href="https://www.maersk.com/"&gt;Maersk’s homepage design&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy for visitors to find their way around.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-digital-marketing-maersk-homepage.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=b2b-marketing-digital-marketing-maersk-homepage.png" alt="b2b-marketing-digital-marketing-maersk-homepage" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.maersk.com/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By offering three main options (“Become a Customer,” “Access Your Account,” and “Start a Career”), Maersk clearly segments their audience and allows visitors to easily navigate to the site content that corresponds with their intent.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This small design tweak also helps Maersk build trust and authority within each of these niche audiences — potential customers, current customers, and even employees.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Content Marketing: LeadPages, Blog + Resources&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/leadpages"&gt;LeadPages&lt;/a&gt; has been bootstrapped since its inception in 2012 … yet it hit over $16 million in revenue just three years later. Its owner attributes its rapid success to its content strategy, which makes it a great example of B2B content marketing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-leadpages-blog-content-marketing.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=b2b-marketing-leadpages-blog-content-marketing.png" alt="b2b-marketing-leadpages-blog-content-marketing" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.leadpages.net/blog/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;LeadPages produces many different types of content resources, such as a blog, customer stories, a podcast, and a webinar. The variety in these resources allows the company to reach customers where they are using the method that best resonates with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;LeadPages offers a blog that covers themes such as A/B testing, lead generation, and other topics that relate to the product and brand, a &lt;a href="https://www.leadpages.net/podcast"&gt;weekly podcast&lt;/a&gt; that chats with everyday entrepreneurs, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.leadpages.net/ultimate-guide-to-landing-pages"&gt;definitive guide to landing pages&lt;/a&gt;, which equips its customers to properly use and optimize the LeadPages product — all for free.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Social Media Marketing: MailChimp, Instagram&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Social media is an effective channel on which to engage with your audience. It’s also a fun place to post gorgeous graphics and show off your brand personality. On &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/mailchimp/"&gt;Instagram, MailChimp&lt;/a&gt; has excelled at both.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/b2b-marketing-social-media-mailchimp-instagram.png?width=600&amp;amp;name=b2b-marketing-social-media-mailchimp-instagram.png" alt="b2b-marketing-social-media-mailchimp-instagram" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxHfxo7FmP3/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center; font-size: 13px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxHfxo7FmP3/"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fewer than half of its Instagram posts have to do with email marketing or the MailChimp product, but the MailChimp team always finds a way to make the posts relevant to its audience and followers — all while featuring fun, engaging, on-brand graphics and videos.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;MailChimp also uses its Instagram to feature real customer stories and testimonials, which can have a big impact on potential consumers in the &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage"&gt;Consideration and Decision stages&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, MailChimp makes use of a took called LinkinBio, which allows Instagram users to click-through to its homepage or other digital content (since Instagram doesn’t offer live links on its platform). This creates a clear conversion path for consumers who discover or research MailChimp on Instagram and want to learn more on its website.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Invest in B2B Marketing and Reach Your Business Customers&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Marketing isn’t effective unless you keep your audience in mind, and no other audience is as fickle and critical as business customers. Your marketing should communicate how your business can help theirs … and if it doesn’t, you may as well not be marketing at all.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use these tips and strategies to understand your B2B audience, round out your buyer personas, and effectively use B2B marketing strategies that reach them. When you’re focused on your audience, your marketing will do the same.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>13 Great Landing Page Examples You'll Want to Copy in 2019</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fantastic-landing-page-examples</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fantastic-landing-page-examples" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/landing-page-examples.jpg" alt="landing-page-examples" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;While many landing pages look different and use a variety of interesting strategies to pull in audiences, they all serve one major purpose. These pages get website visitors to convert to the next stage in &lt;a href="/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey"&gt;the buyer's journey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;Rather than serving as a basic advertisement that shows a customer a product, a landing page aims to engage and delight a customer by offering them something that relates to the product or the company's industry. When they fill out the form and receive a reward of interesting content, they might be even more likely to trust your brand and become a customer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;Here's a quick example. If a business wants to sell an AI product that helps salespeople, they might create a landing page that offers audiences a free video on how to use AI in the sales industry. Interested audiences might offer their contact information in exchange for the valuable information. If they enjoy the video they've received, they might be more likely to respond to or purchase a product from a company rep who calls them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;In another scenario, a publishing company that targets an audience of chief executives might create a landing page that invites audiences to sign up for a webinar hosted by an executive at a major company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;After giving their email address on the signup form presented on the landing page, the leads get an email with the webinar dates and log in information, as well as instructions on how to sign up for the publication's newsletter or subscription. If the user is pleased by the webinar, they might sign up for the newsletter or a subscription to keep up with similar publication content. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;Although their purpose is simple enough in theory, actually designing a successful landing page requires some detailed planning and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/design-website-experiments?_ga=2.259813322.1706660370.1562589600-1582690004.1559596502" style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;creative testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even after launching your landing page, you'll want to pay attention to conversion rates to see how well it's doing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine your conversion rate, simply divide the number of conversions a webpage generates by the number of people who visited that page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your conversion rate isn't close to the average just yet, don't worry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate"&gt;Nailing those percentages &lt;/a&gt;can be a bit challenging at first, especially is you have a lot of regular page visitors. Luckily, there are a number of simple &lt;a href="/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide"&gt;conversion rate optimization strategies&lt;/a&gt; that can help you boost your current rate quickly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what your business is selling or the conversion action you hope to instigate, it's helpful to get inspired by seeing what other great landing pages look like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;While many landing pages look different and use a variety of interesting strategies to pull in audiences, they all serve one major purpose. These pages get website visitors to convert to the next stage in &lt;a href="/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey"&gt;the buyer's journey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;Rather than serving as a basic advertisement that shows a customer a product, a landing page aims to engage and delight a customer by offering them something that relates to the product or the company's industry. When they fill out the form and receive a reward of interesting content, they might be even more likely to trust your brand and become a customer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;Here's a quick example. If a business wants to sell an AI product that helps salespeople, they might create a landing page that offers audiences a free video on how to use AI in the sales industry. Interested audiences might offer their contact information in exchange for the valuable information. If they enjoy the video they've received, they might be more likely to respond to or purchase a product from a company rep who calls them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;In another scenario, a publishing company that targets an audience of chief executives might create a landing page that invites audiences to sign up for a webinar hosted by an executive at a major company. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;After giving their email address on the signup form presented on the landing page, the leads get an email with the webinar dates and log in information, as well as instructions on how to sign up for the publication's newsletter or subscription. If the user is pleased by the webinar, they might sign up for the newsletter or a subscription to keep up with similar publication content. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;Although their purpose is simple enough in theory, actually designing a successful landing page requires some detailed planning and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/design-website-experiments?_ga=2.259813322.1706660370.1562589600-1582690004.1559596502" style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;creative testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even after launching your landing page, you'll want to pay attention to conversion rates to see how well it's doing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine your conversion rate, simply divide the number of conversions a webpage generates by the number of people who visited that page.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your conversion rate isn't close to the average just yet, don't worry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate"&gt;Nailing those percentages &lt;/a&gt;can be a bit challenging at first, especially is you have a lot of regular page visitors. Luckily, there are a number of simple &lt;a href="/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide"&gt;conversion rate optimization strategies&lt;/a&gt; that can help you boost your current rate quickly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what your business is selling or the conversion action you hope to instigate, it's helpful to get inspired by seeing what other great landing pages look like. And because there's no one "right" way of &lt;a href="http://pearl.stylemixthemes.com/landing/"&gt;designing a landing page&lt;/a&gt;, you'll want to check out examples from lots of different industries for different stages of the buying process.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Want to get inspired? Check out the great landing page examples below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We don't have access to the analytics for each of these landing pages, so I can't tell you specifically how well they convert visitors, contacts, leads, and customers. But many of them do follow best practices while also implementing a few new experiments that could give you ideas for your own landing pages.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;13 Great Examples of Landing Page Design&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/drive-for-lyft"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We love that on Lyft's landing page, they zero in on their drivers' main motivation: earning money easily.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We also love that, in addition to the "Apply Now" form, drivers can type their city and the number of hours they might drive for Lyft in a week to calculate how much they'd make. When visitors fill out that information and press "Calculate," they aren't taken to a new page. Instead, they see a dollar amount followed by a new call-to-action button to "Apply Now" (which, once clicked, takes drivers up to the form).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By offering these two conversion paths, they're able to address two different types of people in the conversion path: those who are ready to make the decision now &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; those who need a little more information before they convert.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lyft-landing-page.png?width=667&amp;amp;height=501&amp;amp;name=lyft-landing-page.png" alt="lyft-landing-page" width="667" height="501"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://www.theprofessionalwingman.com/apply-for-coaching-1"&gt;The Professional Wingman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the whole idea of having a professional wingman to help you find dates and a meaningful relationship is already pretty cool. But when you're faced with the prospect of hiring one, it also raises questions. How does it work? How much does it cost? Is this really going to help me?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That's why we love this landing page for Thomas Edwards, the original Professional Wingman himself, which outlines exactly what a complimentary coaching session is going to achieve. Plus, it's clear that it's complimentary, thanks to the boldly-colored call-to-action button above the fold.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you click that button, you aren't taken to a new page. Instead, an interstitial form appears right there. And while it does request a lot of information -- some of it a bit personal -- it also sends the message that The Professional Wingman is going to take this seriously, but only if you do, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional%20wingman.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=professional%20wingman.gif" alt="professional wingman landing page" width="669" title="professional wingman.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://muckrack.com/"&gt;Muck Rack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This landing page design has it all. It's visually appealing and interactive, offers scannable yet descriptive headers about Muck Rack's services, and uses quotes from industry professionals as social proof. Plus, the page is intuitive and easy to navigate.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The cool part about this landing page is that it can appeal to both of Muck Rack's audiences. The top of the page is split into two, featuring their two different services side by side. Once a visitor moves his or her mouse over either of the "find journalists" or the "build free portfolio" CTAs, a very &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms"&gt;simple form&lt;/a&gt; appears -- and that's important, so as not to distract the user from the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/muckrack.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=muckrack.gif" alt="muckrack landing page" width="669" title="muckrack.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.cigital.com/resources/ebooks-and-whitepapers/security-threat-modeling-misconceptions/"&gt;Cigital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that make this Cigital landing page work. It has simple and relevant imagery. The headline is straightforward and the description of the ebook informs viewers of the specific value they will get by downloading it. There is only one call-to-action -- "READ THE EBOOK" -- that stands out on the page thanks to a bright yellow CTA button.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The only thing we'd change about this landing page is that we'd remove the navigation bar at the top. They tend to distract visitors and lead them away from the intended action. Not only is this a landing page design best practice, but &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-navigation-ht"&gt;we've also conducted A/B tests&lt;/a&gt; that've shown removing navigation links from landing pages increases conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Cigital.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=Cigital.gif" alt="Cigital landing page" width="669" title="Cigital.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The hard part about using your homepage as a landing page is that you have to cater to several different types of audiences. But Khan Academy's homepage does that very well. This page is clearly designed for three different types of visitors: those who want to learn something, those who want to teach, and parents who are interested in using Khan Academy for their kids. Plus, how motivational is the emblazoned "You can learn anything" text at the top?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the page is designed for viewers who are not completely familiar with Khan Academy. It colorfully and largely spells out the key benefits of using the learning platform -- all of which are easy to scan and understand. There's also a recurring CTA: "Start learning now." As soon as viewers feel they have enough information, they can click the CTA to get taken back up to the form at the top of the page without having to scroll.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" style="width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/khan%20academy.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=khan%20academy.gif" alt="khan academy landing page" width="669" title="khan academy.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://clubw.com/gifts/corporate/"&gt;Club W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33441/10-Companies-That-Totally-Nail-Copywriting.aspx"&gt;delightful copy can go a long way&lt;/a&gt; on your landing page. We love the playful little aside -- "(Hint: It's Wine)" -- that Club W included below the header of their corporate gifting landing page. It humanizes the brand and makes them likable, which could have a positive impact on their conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The images below that header make a nice use of negative space, showing the user exactly what his or her gift recipient might actually receive, should they choose to gift with Club W. And, of course, there's that bold call to action -- "Email Us".&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The one thing we'd change? The CTA prompts the users email software to open, which drives traffic away from the site and the browser entirely. A form might be more effective here -- not only would Club W be able to dictate what information it wants to capture, but also, it would keep the user on-site.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/club%20w.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=club%20w.gif" style="width: 669px;" width="669" alt="club w landing page" title="club w.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I like this page because it's simple in both copy and design. The image above the fold is a computer screen displaying an HTML bracket with a blinking cursor -- a whimsical, clear visual to accompany the form on the right.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The form itself is simple and only requires an email address, username, password, and a validation that you're not a robot to create an account. Or, you can just use your Facebook or Google Plus login, shortening the conversion path even further.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For visitors who need more information before creating an account, the landing page also offers a video below the fold that explains their concept and value by way of a real-life success story. Again, this helps make the potentially intimidating world of coding more approachable for beginners.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Those who need even more convincing can continue scrolling for additional testimonials and other forms of social proof.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/codecademy.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=codecademy.gif" alt="codecademy landing page" width="669" title="codecademy.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://poachedjobs.com/choose/"&gt;Poached&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I don't think we've ever lived in a time when, culturally, we've been so food-obsessed. Poached has turned that into a B2B model with a platform to connect proprietors and culinary talent.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you visit the homepage, there's no mystery about what you're there to do -- the giant "Post a job" and "Choose a city" calls to action help with that. And once you click on one of them, you're taken to a no-frills form to become a member or log in, or a list of jobs in each city. It's colorful and comprehensive -- and, it makes us hungry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/poached.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=poached.gif" alt="poached landing page" width="669" title="poached.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://breather.com/"&gt;Breather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example of clever, delightful design on a landing page. As soon as you visit Breather.com, there's an instant call to action: indicate where you want to find a space. Plus, it uses location services to figure out where you are, providing instant options nearby.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We love how Breather used simple, to-the-point copy to let the visitor know what the company does, followed immediately by the CTA to select a city. And if you need to scroll down for more information, you can see that Breather &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/writing-great-microcopy"&gt;played with the microcopy&lt;/a&gt; with personality ("no commitment, ever"), reminding us there are real humans behind the design. That brings us a little closer to the brand. The negative space and soothing color scheme are also aligned with the product -- essentially, room to breathe.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/breather.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=breather.gif" style="width: 669px;" width="669" alt="breather.gif" title="breather.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.startupinstitute.com/apply/"&gt;Startup Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to your website won't hand over their personal information without knowing what they're going to get in return. On its landing page, Startup Institute makes abundantly clear what will happen after you apply by listing a Q&amp;amp;A right beside the form. It might prompt some people to say, "They read my mind!"&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To avoid hesitancy to fill out a form, use your landing page to set expectations upfront. That clears the air, and can also weed out the people who don't take your content, product or service seriously.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Startup%20Institute.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=Startup%20Institute.gif" width="669" alt="Startup Institute landing page" title="Startup Institute.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. &lt;a href="http://edupath.com/planding/PSO020414/"&gt;Edupath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Who is your landing page's target audience? While most of Edupath's website content is directed toward students, there are sections dedicated to advising parents on helping their teenagers through college applications and SAT preparation. The landing page below is in one of these sections.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When parents fill out their teenager's name, email address, and mobile number, a link to download the Edupath app is sent directly to them. The folks at Edupath know students are likely to do something if their parents ask them to -- especially if it means they don't have to surrender their phones.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Plus, it's an easy, one-click process. This whole conversion path is a clever and helpful way to get the apps on more students' phones by way of their parents.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/edupath.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=edupath.gif" width="669" alt="edupath landing page" title="edupath.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.tastersclub.com/"&gt;Taster's Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If there's anything we enjoy more than a fine whiskey, it's a whiskey club homepage that makes it easy to either join or learn more about membership. Case in point: Taster's Club, which immediately serves up those very two CTAs on its landing page -- which also happens to be its homepage.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For those to wish to learn more, clicking that CTA will immediately scroll the user down to colorful, image-rich details on what a Taster's Club membership includes. Keep scrolling, and you get user testimonials.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But clicking the "Join Now" button is where the real fun begins. After doing that, you get to pick your poison -- that is, the type of whiskey you like the most -- and view the membership or gifting options available for it. Once you make your selections, you're taken to an easy-to-navigate checkout page to enter your payment information. Good design and ease of use? We'll drink to that.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/taster's%20club.gif?width=669&amp;amp;name=taster's%20club.gif" width="669" alt="taster's club landing page" title="taster's club.gif" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. &lt;a href="https://info.microsoft.com/US-SCRTY-WBNR-FY19-06Jun-20-SpeakingofsecurityPrivacycompliance-1712_LP02OnDemandRegistration-ForminBody.html"&gt;Microsoft IT Showcase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The landing page below has been used to market and generate leads for one episode of Microsoft's IT Showcase webinar series.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Microsoft%20IT%20Showcase%20Webinar%20Landing%20page.jpg?width=1449&amp;amp;name=Microsoft%20IT%20Showcase%20Webinar%20Landing%20page.jpg" alt="Microsoft IT Showcase Webinar Landing page" width="1449" style="width: 1449px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This simple and straightforward design does a great job of presenting why the webinar being offered is important to IT professionals. Along with a quick blurb describing what the webinar will discuss, the page also includes links to similar webinars, details on the speakers, and links to Microsoft resources that touch on the topics that will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An IT company which has access to thought leaders or experts in their industry could similarly use this webinar landing page strategy to generate both leads and prospective customer trust. Audiences who feel informed after reading the landing page might sign up expecting the webinar to be insightful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If the webinar seems informative and credible, these audiences will think that the IT company has an expertise in the product and might have quality product offerings. This will make them more willing to talk to a representative to learn more or purchase a product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Ready to build your landing page?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode, &lt;a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/authors/1338/kerry-oshea-gorgone"&gt;Kerry O'Shea Gorgone&lt;/a&gt; speaks with &lt;span&gt;Chief Marketing Officer of the &lt;a href="http://www.seewinter.com/"&gt;Clearwater Marine Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Potts. They discuss Winter the dolphin, whose story of recovery from losing her tail was chronicled in the movie &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seewinter.com/winter-hope/dolphin-tale-1-2"&gt;Dolphin Tale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Thanks to their social media and public relations teams' relentless work to get Winter's story shared with local media outlets, she eventually became the star of a &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564349/"&gt;hit film&lt;/a&gt; (seriously, rent this movie).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In light of the Aquarium's newfound fame, Potts talks about their strategies for maintaining the momentum of the &lt;em&gt;Dolphin Tale&lt;/em&gt; films by investing in social media more than ever. In particular, they've experienced a lot of engagement by live streaming video of their animals on Facebook Live, Periscope, and Snapchat. (&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-live?__hssc=20629287.10.1474398461787&amp;amp;__hstc=20629287.dc073748a50a48dd9f360ef7e8e917fc.1469726067860.1474395517776.1474398461787.200&amp;amp;__hsfp=3994949749&amp;amp;hsCtaTracking=066aa34c-8af8-4d8a-b5d3-99c63ec0d561%7C6745c27e-db57-4f1c-bada-0bde19a599b1"&gt;You can learn how to master Facebook Live with the help of this free guide.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"[Live-streams are] not super-rehearsed. They really are authentic. We focus on the animal, we focus on the story, and we don't script it. We have an outline of what we want to be reviewed during the live webcast, but we make sure they're naturally delivered. They're really not rehearsed. They just happen. We do schedule and plan them, and we do know what's going to be discussed, but we make it really authentic. It's a one-take deal."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All organizations have a story to tell&lt;/strong&gt;, whether it's about their mission, an individual, or a certain achievement. Give it the direction it needs to garner attention from media.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't just talk about yourself:&lt;/strong&gt; Get others to talk about you on social media and in the press to earn more attention. (&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/inbound-press-release-templates"&gt;Here's a handy PR guide&lt;/a&gt; to help with that.)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live streams should be raw, unscripted, and authentic:&lt;/strong&gt; You can practice using the technology, but ultimately, remain flexible to allow room for more genuine content. (Check out &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-live-stream-checklist"&gt;this live streaming checklist&lt;/a&gt; before you get started.)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't be afraid to experiment with how and where you're sharing video content.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, the aquarium turns over their Snapchat to trainers working with animals 1:1 so followers can see how the aquarium helps marine life up close.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn about your audience and where to reach them:&lt;/strong&gt; For the aquarium, it's mothers on Facebook.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Online Marketing Made Easy with Amy Porterfield&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;How to Get Started with Facebook Live&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amyporterfield.com/2016/05/111-how-to-get-started-with-facebook-live/"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This episode of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmyPorterfield?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Amy Porterfield's&lt;/a&gt; marketing podcast features &lt;a href="http://kimgarst.com/"&gt;Kim Garst&lt;/a&gt; of Boom Social, where they discuss best practices and strategies for using &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-guide"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt;. Main themes of this episode included determining how often to broadcast, apprehension about broadcasting live and making mistakes, and uncertainty about measuring success.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"I think the reason live video is so impactful (again, this is my opinion and what I’ve seen through my personal experiences and watching other people) is that people are so attracted to people who are not just real, but people that are relatable. In other words, they can see themselves having that issue."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency is a contributor to successful live streams:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a regular schedule on Facbeook Live or Periscope to expand your reach after you stop broadcasting live.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carefully choose your broadcast's headline: &lt;/strong&gt;Remember, this is an opportunity to grab more attention from followers.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate an offer into pre-outreach for your Facebook Live event.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, tell followers that you'll be giving away promo codes, ebooks, or checklists that they can only download if they tune in.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a strategy to achieve a specific goal for every single broadcast&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't just talk for the sake of sharing.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a way to capture people's attention while they scroll:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook only counts "Views" as users who watched for 10 seconds or more.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duration: 55:31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Social Media Marketing with Michael Stelzner&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Content Creation Hacks&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/content-creation-hacks-how-to-produce-valuable-content-quickly/"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This episode, hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/"&gt;Social Media Examiner&lt;/a&gt; Founder and CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Stelzner"&gt;Michael Stelzner&lt;/a&gt;, focuses on social media content creation with the help of special guest and social media pro, &lt;a href="http://www.nickwestergaard.com/"&gt;Nick Westergaard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the interview, Westergaard discusses the fact that everyone knows they need to create content, but not everyone knows how to do it most effectively. Many content creators don't operate with a comprehensive strategy, which can make people object putting in the work to make content pay off. Westergaard mentions the term "checklist marketing," which he says refers to marketers tackling every new marketing strategy like an item on a to-do list without objectives or strategy in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"You have to gamify it a little bit and think about, if you're creating one thing, how many more things can I create out of this? ... By planning one piece of content, I create many."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a team approach to social media content creation&lt;/strong&gt; to both share the workload and curate a diverse array of content -- even from colleagues who aren't marketers.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/user-generated-content-mistakes#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;user-generated content&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a campaign around an event or hashtag so your followers are sharing photos and messages that you can share with your networks.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repurpose content:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're writing a blog post or designing an infographic (&lt;a href="https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-create-infographics-in-powerpoint"&gt;here are some helpful templates for that&lt;/a&gt;), find a way to create smaller pieces of it that can be used as social media posts. Additionally, you can string smaller pieces of content together to create an ebook or guide.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take part in #TBT:&lt;/strong&gt; Align your older content with current events and re-share it on social media. This takes advantage of &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychology-ecommerce-sales-consumer-nostalgia#sm.00006uybatuk9erxqe91juzya6sra"&gt;nostalgia marketing&lt;/a&gt; and re-promotes content you've already created.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Savvy Social Podcast with Andréa Jones&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;How to Network with People on Social Media (Without Feeling Weird About It)&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinedrea.com/podcast/how-to-network-with-people-on-social-media-without-feeling-weird-about-it/"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinedrea.com/author/onlinedrea/"&gt;Andréa Jones&lt;/a&gt; looks into one of the ways that brands could grow their social audiences without buying ads: networking. It can sometimes feel strange meeting others on social media just to prospect for potential customers, but Jones covers a range of methods to make it easier.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The podcast had a Q&amp;amp;A style structure, where Jones' LinkedIn followers asked questions about creating a brand presence on social media.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The premise is simple: meet people on social media who would potentially give you money for your 'thing.' Simple yet incredibly challenging to execute because as soon as we start talking about what we do, it can feel… icky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a people-first perspective.&lt;/strong&gt; Don't get spammy -- be confident in the value of your offering and trust that organic social media marketing will be more effective than getting in your customer's faces.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the needs, wants, desires of your customers.&lt;/strong&gt; Emphasize the ways your products or services will impact your network more than emphasizing yourself.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List what you do on your personal profile.&lt;/strong&gt; You can share your work updates, anniversaries, and announcements on your profile to build your personal brand. This could make consumers curious about your company and want to learn more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A company's social presence should reflect the brand's personality.&lt;/strong&gt; Keeping a consistent and reliable brand presence will help engage your target audience and lead them to connecting on social media.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. TED Radio Hour with Guy Raz&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Why Do We Like What We Like?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode of the &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks"&gt;TED Talks&lt;/a&gt; podcast, host &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyraz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Guy Raz&lt;/a&gt; interviews several TED speakers who've talked about branding:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Filmmaker and &lt;span&gt;Producer of &lt;em&gt;Super Size Me &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorganSpurlock?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Morgan Spurlock&lt;/a&gt; discusses how brands impact our purchasing decisions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Management Advisor and Author &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joepine?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Joseph Pine&lt;/a&gt; touches on the power of authenticity.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather Group's Vice Chairman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rorysutherland"&gt;Rory Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; explores the real versus perceived value of different products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Their discussions are varied and well worth the full listen, but the overarching theme was how brands' perception impacts their success (or lack thereof). Pine mentions that customers make choices because they're bought into the dreams and imagery surrounding big brands, and that once they start using the product, they start to believe the message.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"Ubiquity is the death of authenticity."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take advantage of the opportunity to cultivate and promote what makes your brand unique.&lt;/strong&gt; There's always room for bragging on social media -- just do it in moderation.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be authentic and real, but don't say that's what you're doing.&lt;/strong&gt; Consumers want authenticity, not disingenuity.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell stories with a sense of place to drive greater authenticity&lt;/strong&gt;: Set the stage when sharing blog posts, updates, and videos on social media so followers can see the kind of activities your organization is up to.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A/B test different types of post on social platforms to see how they perform comparatively: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consumers don't objectively think a product or service is good or bad -- branding and marketing messages impact their perception, and that's in your hands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. The Growth Show with Meghan Keaney Anderson&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Episode 100: Guy Kawasaki's Unconventional Advice on Growth&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://apple.co/2cNWqWj"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this episode of &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/podcast"&gt;The Growth Show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;HubSpot CMO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kippbodnar"&gt;Kipp Bodnar&lt;/a&gt; sat down with Canva Chief Evangelist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GuyKawasaki"&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; to discuss &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories-guide"&gt;Instagram Stories&lt;/a&gt; versus &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-a-snapchat-story"&gt;Snapchat Stories&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook Live video, and organizational growth challenges. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;During the discussion, Kawasaki admits that he prefers Instagram to Snapchat due to its superior content discoverability features and analytics options. And when it comes to Facebook Live, he is bought in.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, he mentions that while taking a break from streaming on vacation, his Facebook reach was only 400,000 users, versus the 1 million users he sees when he's streaming regularly. (Spoiler alert: He also lets listeners in on his secrets to greater engagement during live streams -- but you'll have to listen to find out what they are.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"I don't want positive, supportive, wonderful, reinforcing engagement on social media. I want any kind of engagement."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook Live drives greater engagement and reach&lt;/strong&gt; than publishing recorded video or sharing a YouTube link.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you're streaming live on Facebook, have a second screen&lt;/strong&gt; (and ideally a teammate) available to see what comments or questions are rolling in from your audience so you can answer them live.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask your audience questions&lt;/strong&gt; while you're streaming live to increase comments, Likes, and followers.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publish regularly and frequently&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;to increase engagement on social media platforms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Maximize Your Social with Neal Schaffer&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;The Influencer Marketing ROI of Creating and Publishing a Roundup Post&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://nealschaffer.com/influencer-marketing-roi-roundup-post/"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Influencer marketing can be a great way of reaching new audiences, so &lt;a href="https://nealschaffer.com/social-media-speaker-neal-schaffer/"&gt;Neal Schaffer&lt;/a&gt; and Codrut Turcanu look into the value of using influencer marketing to promote roundup posts. When blogs post lists of offerings, they are making what's known as a roundup post or crowdsourced article. An example of this might be "The 7 Best Ecommerce Software in 2019" or the blog post you're reading right now!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Influencers can be excellent marketers as they have engaged audiences and can share content directly to them, leading to a lot of traffic. Schaffer and Turcanu discuss what the ROI of influencers sharing roundup articles to their networks.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"You want to ensure you’re engaging with the right people with the biggest impact."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think of the end result.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be time consuming to find bloggers or influencers to promote your product or service, but if you know what your goal is, then you can start compiling the right lists of leads and partners to get going.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying the right influencers is crucial.&lt;/strong&gt; It's important to find and engage the right people that have the greatest impact on your target network.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roundup blog posts are beneficial for connecting with wider audiences.&lt;/strong&gt; These kinds of posts pick up traffic from the organizations, services, and thought leaders featured in the article.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roundups put you on the radar of influencers.&lt;/strong&gt; Publishing a crowdsourced article helps build relationships and build your social community.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Hashtagged with Jordan Powers&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Focusing on Creating Content and Community Versus Being an Influencer with Dan Joyce&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://hashtaggedpodcast.com/danjoyce/"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Hashtagged, host &lt;a href="http://hashtaggedpodcast.com/about/"&gt;Jordan Powers&lt;/a&gt; interviews &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/danjoyce/"&gt;Dan Joyce&lt;/a&gt;, a content creator on Instagram, about the cultivation of vibrant and engaged social media communities. Joyce was one of Instagram's very first users.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They swap stories about how they started using Instagram first as a creative outlet, and then eventually as a tool for content creation and personal networking. As a professional content creator, Joyce initially began experimenting with Instagram, but it's since evolved into a powerful network that photographers and other content creators can harness:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"[The] platform has provided a breadth of knowledge about photography and content creation in a way that makes big social network a lot smaller ... There are so many types of content being shared on Instagram, it's created its own ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can't force becoming an influencer or thought leader&lt;/strong&gt;, even on social media. Share lots of unique and creative content to grow your social network, and followers will come after.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals and brands can use Instagram as a more professional portfolio&lt;/strong&gt; of photographs and Snapchat as a more lighthearted photo log of their day-to-day.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiment with the types of posts you share on Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Powers found that when his posts are more about content creation than networking, they end up performing better. (&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-to-post-on-instagram"&gt;Here are 18 photo and video ideas for Instagram to try.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;7 Social Media Mistakes Companies Make &amp;amp; How You Can Avoid Them&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inbound Marketing Today is hosted by Neil Brown, founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.browncreativegroup.com/"&gt;Brown Creative Group&lt;/a&gt;, and in this episode, he discusses common mistakes businesses are making on social media:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Treating all social media sites as if they're the same and not changing up how you share content.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Too much automation.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Not posting on social media frequently enough.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Not responding to questions or comments.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Deleting negative posts, comments, and reviews.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Trying to be active on every social media channel.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Not having a lead generation strategy.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"You want to use automation to make marketing more efficient, not to appear as a bot. Social media should be social."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media is an arm of your customer service team:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim to be helpful, positive, and delightful to your customers.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's better for engagement to have a comprehensive strategy for only two social media platforms&lt;/strong&gt; than to post at random on all platforms.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain your voice's authenticity.&lt;/strong&gt; You're a human speaking for an organization, so don't forget to be real, and connect with people when they seek assistance or give feedback.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode of &lt;a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/"&gt;Convince and Convert's&lt;/a&gt; Social Pros, hosts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaybaer"&gt;Jay Baer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamcb?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Adam Brown&lt;/a&gt; interview &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jbernoff"&gt;Josh Bernoff&lt;/a&gt; -- c&lt;span&gt;hief troublemaker at &lt;a href="http://withoutbullshit.com/"&gt;Without Bullsh*t&lt;/a&gt; -- about writing quality content for social media. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Bernoff's mission is to eliminate convoluted writing from marketing, and he thinks it's a challenge because we were rewarded for writing long papers when we first learned to write in school. Now, that experience is impacting social media posts, press releases, and blog posts in a detrimental way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"You're not creating art. You're creating effective communication, and there's nothing wrong with doing that simply and directly."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get to the point.&lt;/strong&gt; You should aim to say what you mean in the first 2-3 sentences of whatever you're writing.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt Baer's ROAM content marketing checklist:&lt;/strong&gt; Who are the &lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;eaders? What are your &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;bjectives? What follow-up &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;ction do you want to inspire from the reader? What i&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt;pression will people have of your organization when they read your content?&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always have another set of eyes look over your content,&lt;/strong&gt; even Facebook captions. Never publish a first draft.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duration: 53:40&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. #AskGaryVee with Gary Vaynerchuk&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;YouTube Growth Strategies, Business Risks &amp;amp; VanyerMedia's New Office&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://askgaryvee.garyvee.libsynpro.com/youtube-growth-strategies-business-risks-vaynermedias-new-office-askgaryvee-episode-220"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In his podcast &lt;em&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;AskGaryVee, Digital Marketing Expert &lt;a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/"&gt;Gary Vanyerchuk&lt;/a&gt; answers questions from his followers (delightfully coined "VanyerPeeps"), and his entertaining responses make it worth the listen. At the beginning of this episode, Vanyerchuk answers questions from a VaynerPeep about strategies for hacking YouTube growth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Vanyerchuk believes that for all content creation -- be it blog, video, or social media -- the distribution is more important than the creation, and that those priorities are often the opposite to modern marketers. It's not enough to write a great blog post, or produce a great YouTube video: it has to be seen and picked up by the right people, and that won't happen unless you hustle for it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"You have to continue to bring value and produce good content, but you also need people to know about it."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try collaborating with other YouTubers or influencers in your space on social media.&lt;/strong&gt; If you can't offer them exposure, what can you offer them in exchange for their partnership? Always offer value.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use targeted hashtags on Instagram to grow your audience there.&lt;/strong&gt; Do some research to determine which tags are generating the highest levels of engagement.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join forums within your industry communities to develop a network of support&lt;/strong&gt; that you can reach out to for social sharing, promotion, and participation in your social media campaigns.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duration: 17:55 (YouTube answer ends at 8:00) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. Manly Pinterest Tips with Jeff Sieh and Erik Fisher&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Pinterest Growth And Instagram Shoppable Posts&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://manlypinteresttips.com/pinterest-growth-instagram-shoppable-posts/"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pinterest is growing, and organizations can really benefit from marketing on one of the biggest media brands. &lt;a href="https://manlypinteresttips.com/about-us/"&gt;Jeff Sieh&lt;/a&gt; took a look with Erik Fisher at how to best connect with Pinterest's quarter of a billion users around the world as well as shopping on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"According to a Nielsen study, 98% of Pinners, they go out and try ideas that they find on Pinterest. And that’s way more than 71% of the other social media platforms."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinterest is a place to reconnect with yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to other platforms where the idea is to connect with other people, Pinterest is for keeping track of things that you like. Driving traffic from Pinterest therefore reflects a genuine interest in your offering.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Pinterest, you're not competing with social content.&lt;/strong&gt; Since Pinterest isn't a typical social networking platform, your products won't have to compete with videos of your friends' kids for your feed's attention.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;98% of pinners go out to try ideas they find on Pinterest.&lt;/strong&gt; Promoting a product on Pinterest makes a ton of sense -- consumers are turning to their pinboards to make purchasing decisions.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram Shopping is hot.&lt;/strong&gt; As a consumer, you can seamlessly buy items off Instagram Stories, and as a seller, you can track consumer behavior in your Instagram store.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duration: 24:00&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. Social Media Social Hour with Tyler Anderson&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Behind the Data: A Quantitative Look at the Future of Social Media&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://casualfridays.com/behind-the-data-a-quantitative-look-at-the-future-of-social-media/"&gt;Click here to listen to this podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Social Media Social Hour, presented by &lt;a href="https://www.scoreboardsocial.com/"&gt;Scoreboard Social&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://casualfridays.com/"&gt;Casual Fridays&lt;/a&gt;, host Tyler Anderson interviews &lt;span&gt;CEO of the &lt;a href="https://www.socialfresh.com/"&gt;Social Fresh&lt;/a&gt;, Jason Keath, to discuss the outlook of the future of social media. Social Fresh recently conducted a &lt;a href="https://training.socialfresh.com/fos16"&gt;survey of over 500 participants&lt;/a&gt; about how brands are measuring, or not measuring, the ROI of their social media strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anderson and Keath discussed many of the findings in the report, with results often circling back to the outlook that video will continue to dominate social media in terms of engagement and ROI. This episode provides in-depth analysis and conversation without being too lengthy, with lots of helpful tips and actionable next steps for listeners along the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;"No one is seeing a return on what they're doing on Snapchat right now... but people are passionate about the engagement opportunity."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize social networks that deliver the greatest ROI: &lt;/strong&gt;According to the report, those networks are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn (in that order).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Instagram is projected to overtake Twitter in terms of popularity and ROI. Keath speculates that it's because Instagram is less saturated than Twitter, which leads to greater engagement.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the ball rolling on a video strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of respondents creating video assets on a monthly basis is growing -- it ranked third for assets marketers are creating after images and blog posts.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duration: 35:10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>25 Handy Slack Hacks Everyone Should Know</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-tips</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/slack-tips" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/Slack_Hacks.jpg" alt="25 Handy Slack Hacks Everyone Should Know" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;A few years ago, the HubSpot team made the switch to Slack (one of the hottest real-time messaging apps on the market). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Initially, it was hard to get used to uttering phrases like "Just Slack me" or "We were Slacking" in passing. But once we got more comfortable with the platform, we started to realize just how powerful it really is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;A few years ago, the HubSpot team made the switch to Slack (one of the hottest real-time messaging apps on the market). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Initially, it was hard to get used to uttering phrases like "Just Slack me" or "We were Slacking" in passing. But once we got more comfortable with the platform, we started to realize just how powerful it really is.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The more we used Slack, the better our discoveries got -- GIFs, reminders, files ... they were all just a click or two away.&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;"&gt;But that's just the thing: Slack is capable of so much that it's hard to uncover what features you really should be using. To help, we put together some of the best Slack hacks below. From creating to-do lists to customizing your theme, these pro tips are worth showing off to your team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;25 Handy Tips for Using Slack&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Conduct advanced searches.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about Slack is that messages and files are easily searchable. Because channels move so fast, you can use these advanced search commands to pull up exactly what you're looking for without wasting any time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Advanced_Search_Slack.png?width=669&amp;amp;height=233&amp;amp;name=Advanced_Search_Slack.png" alt="Advanced_Search_Slack.png" title="Advanced_Search_Slack.png" width="669" height="233" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Channels and direct messages&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in:channelname&lt;/strong&gt; - Searches only the messages and/or files in a specific channel.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in:name&lt;/strong&gt; - Searches your direct messages with a specific user.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Messages or files from a specific person&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from:username&lt;/strong&gt; - Limits your search to messages from a specific person in any channel or direct message.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;from:me&lt;/strong&gt; - Searches only messages you've sent, anywhere in Slack.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Links, starred items, and emoji reactions&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has:link&lt;/strong&gt; - Narrows your search to messages that contain a specific URL.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has:star&lt;/strong&gt; - Pulls messages you've starred.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;has::emojiname:&lt;/strong&gt; - Searches messages that contain a specific emoji.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Dates and times&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;before: &lt;/strong&gt;Use words like "yesterday" or "today."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;after: &lt;/strong&gt;Use words like "week," "month," or "year."&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on: or &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;during: &lt;/strong&gt;Use specific dates and range keywords, such as "Monday," "February," or "2016."&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/strong&gt; To use very specific dates, use the MM/DD/YYYY (United States) or YYYY/MM/DD (International) format.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For more on searching in Slack, &lt;a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202528808-Searching-in-Slack"&gt;check out this resource.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Use the /remind commands to create a to-do list.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Set a Slackbot reminder to help you keep track of what you need to get done. To get started, simply enter &lt;strong&gt;/remind&lt;/strong&gt; into the text box, followed by your task. (Note: Only you will be able to see the command and the reminder.) You can schedule a reminder for a specific time or set a date using the MM/DD/YYYY format.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Remind_function_Slack.png?width=429&amp;amp;height=318&amp;amp;name=Remind_function_Slack.png" alt="Remind_function_Slack.png" title="Remind_function_Slack.png" width="429" height="318" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to review your list of reminders, simply use the command &lt;strong&gt;/remind list&lt;/strong&gt;. From there, you can mark certain tasks as complete or delete the ones you no longer need.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-02-05_at_1.15.08_PM.png?width=393&amp;amp;height=187&amp;amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-02-05_at_1.15.08_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2016-02-05_at_1.15.08_PM.png" title="Screen_Shot_2016-02-05_at_1.15.08_PM.png" width="393" height="187" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. React with a GIF.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let's face it: &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gif-websites"&gt;We all love GIFs&lt;/a&gt;. And thanks to the Giphy integration, you can share hilarious GIFs with your coworkers using the &lt;strong&gt;/Giphy [emotion, word, or phrase]&lt;/strong&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To set up the Giphy app, &lt;a href="https://slack.com/apps/A0F827J2C-giphy"&gt;visit this page&lt;/a&gt;. From here, all you'll have to do is click "Install" next to your team name, then click "Add Giphy Integration."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="content-post__body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Giphy can be a hit or miss ... sometimes the GIFs are NSFW or not quite right for the situation. But, if you don't mind gambling with the results, this hack is very easy to set up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Giphy_slack.png?width=635&amp;amp;height=468&amp;amp;name=Giphy_slack.png" alt="Giphy_slack.png" title="Giphy_slack.png" width="635" height="468"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Use the /collapse &amp;amp; /expand commands to open and close files.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Weeding your way through a sea of GIFs to get to the comment you're looking for? You can collapse all inline images and video by using the &lt;strong&gt;/collapse &lt;/strong&gt;command. When you need to reference the visuals again, simply enter &lt;strong&gt;/expand&lt;/strong&gt; to make them reappear.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Expand_and_Collpase.png?width=620&amp;amp;height=166&amp;amp;name=Expand_and_Collpase.png" alt="Expand_and_Collpase.png" title="Expand_and_Collpase.png" width="620" height="166" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;span&gt;Add text and link formatting to your Slack messages.&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Want to call out text, make edits, display a link, or share code? Reference the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slack link formatting: &lt;/strong&gt;To share a link with a preview image, just send a URL in a message. Slack will automatically create a preview unless a user has their preview settings turned off. Note: It is not yet possible to hyperlink specific words in a Slack message.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasis:&lt;/strong&gt; To create bold text, surround your word or phrase with *asterisks.* To italicize text, place _underscores_ around a section.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strikethrough: &lt;/strong&gt;To strike out certain words, use ~tilde~ to surround the text.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lists: &lt;/strong&gt;To create lists, select "Shift" + "Enter" to add a new line. To add bullet points, select Opt+8 (Mac) or Alt+0149 (PC).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert a paragraph break:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to break up words without using a list, use a soft return. Instead of hitting enter at the end of a sentence, which will send the message, hold shift and tap the enter key to start a new line.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Using%20a%20soft%20enter%20in%20a%20Slack%20message.png?width=626&amp;amp;name=Using%20a%20soft%20enter%20in%20a%20Slack%20message.png" alt="Using a soft enter in a Slack message" width="626" style="width: 626px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockquotes: &lt;/strong&gt;To add angle brackets at the start of your message for indents and quotes, type "&amp;gt;" to indent a single lines or "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;" to indent multiple paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code blocks:&lt;/strong&gt; To display a section as inline fixed-width text, use single `backticks` around the selected area. To create a block of pre-formatted, fixed-width text, use triple ```backticks.```&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Text_Formatting.png?width=670&amp;amp;height=241&amp;amp;name=Text_Formatting.png" alt="Text_Formatting.png" title="Text_Formatting.png" width="670" height="241" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. Toggle between statuses using the /away command.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't leave your coworkers hanging. If you have to step away from your computer or head to a meeting, make it clear by adjusting your status. To quickly toggle between "away" and "active," use the &lt;strong&gt;/away &lt;/strong&gt;command.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slack_Away_Command.png?width=621&amp;amp;height=172&amp;amp;name=Slack_Away_Command.png" alt="Slack_Away_Command.png" title="Slack_Away_Command.png" width="621" height="172" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;7. Add notifications for keywords and phrases.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're managing a specific project or trying to keep tabs on a certain department or activity, adjusting your settings to enable custom notifications can be a huge time saver.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get notified when a specific word or phrase is mentioned, start by selecting your name from the top left corner, then clicking "Preferences" from the drop-down menu. From there, select "Notification Settings" and scroll down to "Highlight Words." In the text box, add words or phrases that you'd like to be notified about (making sure to separate them by commas).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Highlight_Words.png?width=620&amp;amp;height=150&amp;amp;name=Highlight_Words.png" alt="Highlight_Words.png" title="Highlight_Words.png" width="620" height="150" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;8. Quickly send a private message using the /msg command.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we find ourselves with questions that warrant the attention of everyone in a specific channel. You know, important things such as, "Does anyone have a stapler?" or "Who is free for lunch?"&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After you ask a question, avoid any further disruption by following up with people via a private message. For example, once you know Steve is free to grab a bite to eat, use the following command to quickly open up a private message to hash out the details: &lt;strong&gt;/msg @user [your message]&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;9. Edit messages you've already sent.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We've all said things we wish we could take back. And with Slack, you can ... kinda. To quickly edit a message you've sent in a conversation, press the ↑ arrow key, edit your message, then press "Enter."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This feature is especially useful when you do something terribly embarrassing, like use the wrong form of "their":&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Message_Edit.png?width=670&amp;amp;height=161&amp;amp;name=Message_Edit.png" alt="Message_Edit.png" title="Message_Edit.png" width="670" height="161" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;10. Connect your Google Drive to Slack.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A lot of teams are already using Google Drive to create and store files online, so why not get the best of both worlds? When you connect your Google Drive with Slack, you have the ability to read and index imported files, and quickly search for them whenever you need them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to connect your Google Drive to Slack:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have a Google Drive link you want to share, simply paste it into a message box. This will prompt Slackbot to deliver the following message:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_5.34.39_PM.png?width=731&amp;amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_5.34.39_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_5.34.39_PM.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 731px;" title="Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_5.34.39_PM.png" width="731"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Click "Yes" to grant Google Drive permission to read the file.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a file you're ready to share, but want to connect Google Drive for future use, visit the &lt;a href="https://slack.com/apps/A0F7YS32P-google-drive"&gt;Google Drive app page&lt;/a&gt;. From here, click "Configure" next to your team name, then click "Authenticate your Google Drive Account" &amp;gt; "Allow."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slack_Google_Doc.png?width=579&amp;amp;name=Slack_Google_Doc.png" alt="Slack_Google_Doc.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 579px;" title="Slack_Google_Doc.png" width="579"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;11. Customize your Slack theme.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether you use Slack for different groups and want to stay organized, or you just want to personalize the look and feel of your account, you can adjust your theme by selecting your name in the top left corner.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From the drop-down menu next to your name, select "Preferences" &amp;gt; "Sidebar Theme." From here, you can explore and select themes or scroll down to "Custom Theme" to put in your own HTML color values.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.28.16_PM.png?width=687&amp;amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.28.16_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.28.16_PM.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 687px;" title="Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.28.16_PM.png" width="687"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;12. Connect IFTTT to Slack to automate tasks.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Serving like a universal adaptor, IFTTT is a handy tool that allows you to automate tasks between two services. And when you connect IFTTT with Slack, the possibilities are seemingly endless. To do so, start by signing up for IFTTT or signing into your existing account. Then, activate the connection &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/slack"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once the two are hooked, you can browse "recipes" or create your own to begin automating tasks. To get you started, check out a few of our favorites:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tell%20Ring%20to%20alert%20Slack%20when%20the%20doorbell%20rings.jpg?width=350&amp;amp;name=Tell%20Ring%20to%20alert%20Slack%20when%20the%20doorbell%20rings.jpg" alt="Tell Ring to alert Slack when the doorbell rings" width="350" style="width: 350px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Connect%20Twitter%20to%20Slack%20to%20see%20mentions%20in%20a%20Slack%20thread.jpg?width=349&amp;amp;name=Connect%20Twitter%20to%20Slack%20to%20see%20mentions%20in%20a%20Slack%20thread.jpg" alt="Connect Twitter to Slack to see mentions in a Slack thread" width="349" style="width: 349px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Post%20to%20Trello%20via%20Slack.jpg?width=352&amp;amp;name=Post%20to%20Trello%20via%20Slack.jpg" alt="Post to Trello via Slack" width="352" style="width: 352px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px;"&gt;(Or get notifications about &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/300701-get-slack-notifications-about-assigned-trello-cards"&gt;assigned Trello cards&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;13. Create your very own emoji.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get started, click on your name in the top left corner and select "Customize Slack" from the dropdown menu.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fill out the form to create your custom emoji. First, you'll need to provide a name for the icon -- this is what you will enter to display the emoji. Next, upload an emoji image.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Slack asks that you use a square image no larger than 128px in width or height, with a file size smaller than 64K. To remove the background from the image (as seen in the Ryan Gosling example below), &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-remove-background-image-in-powerpoint-design-ht"&gt;check out this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Custom_Emoji.png?width=419&amp;amp;name=Custom_Emoji.png" alt="Custom_Emoji.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 419px;" title="Custom_Emoji.png" width="419"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;14. Create custom triggers for Slackbot responses.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Make Slack your own by customizing Slackbot's automated responses to certain words or phrases. To do so, click on your name in the top left corner and select "Customize Slack" from the dropdown menu.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Select the second tab from the left labeled "Slackbot" to access the message customization field. Insert one or multiple input phrases with commas, and then add a Slackbot response or responses by adding each one to its own line ("Shift" + "Enter"). If you insert multiple responses, Slack will call up one at random when it's triggered.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, this automated Britney Spears response for the word "Oops!" turns mistakes into smiles.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Custom_Response.png?width=575&amp;amp;name=Custom_Response.png" alt="Custom_Response.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 575px;" title="Custom_Response.png" width="575"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;15. Add custom loading messages.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice the witty messages and tips displayed when Slack is loading? Well, you can add your very own loading messages for a fun, personalized experience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To start adding new messages, click on your name in the top left corner and select "Customize Slack" from the dropdown menu. Click on the third tab from the left labeled "Loading Messages," add a message in the text box, and hit "Add Message."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: There's never been a better opportunity to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling"&gt;Rick Roll&lt;/a&gt; your coworkers than this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Load_Messages.png?width=1009&amp;amp;name=Load_Messages.png" alt="Load_Messages.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 1009px;" title="Load_Messages.png" width="1009"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;16. Jump to any conversation in seconds using Slack's Quick Switcher.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you've got a really big team, it's likely that you're involved with quite a few Slack channels. To quickly and easily switch from a channel to a private message back to a different channel, simply hit &lt;strong&gt;⌘ + K (Mac)&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Ctrl + K (Windows and Linux)&lt;/strong&gt;. A popup will appear where you can begin typing a person or channel's and select the correct option to open the conversation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Quick_Switcher.png?width=500&amp;amp;name=Quick_Switcher.png" alt="Quick_Switcher.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 500px;" title="Quick_Switcher.png" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;17. Pose as a celebrity to fool your team.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Troll your coworkers using &lt;a href="http://slacker.nathanhoad.net/"&gt;Slacker&lt;/a&gt; -- a handy tool that allows you to post funny replies as your favorite character. Slacker comes with a ton of built in characters, from Kanye West to Marge Simpson.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can even add your own character by selecting the green "+" icon. Simply add a name, image URL, and default message to add them to your collection.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slack_Celeb.png?width=935&amp;amp;name=Slack_Celeb.png" alt="Slack_Celeb.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 935px;" title="Slack_Celeb.png" width="935"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.34.10_PM.png?width=727&amp;amp;name=Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.34.10_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.34.10_PM.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 727px;" title="Screen_Shot_2016-02-07_at_7.34.10_PM.png" width="727"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;18. Use emoji reactions to take a quick poll.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Words are hard. Sometimes it's a lot easier to let our coworkers know how we feel by reacting with an emoji. And on Slack, it's easy. Simply hover over a message and select the smiley face icon with the plus sign to select an emoji.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Want to take things a step further? Reaction emojis make it really easy to quickly poll your team. Here's a great example from the folks at BetterCloud:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt; 
 &lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;Our office uses the reaction emojis in Slack for easy voting. What is your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SlackHack?src=hash"&gt;#SlackHack&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ"&gt;@SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RlXveBjgYY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RlXveBjgYY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; — BetterCloud (@bettercloud) 
 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bettercloud/status/696778029918507008"&gt;February 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;h3&gt;19) Pull swatches using HTML color codes.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with another team member on a design project? Make quick color suggestions using HTML color codes. When you type out a code -- #F7761F, for example -- you'll see a tiny swatch appear, like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HTML_color_code.png?width=380&amp;amp;height=110&amp;amp;name=HTML_color_code.png" alt="HTML_color_code.png" title="HTML_color_code.png" width="380" height="110" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;20. Created a to-do list using stars.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Starring an item on Slack is a way to mark a task as important. To star an item, simply move your mouse of a message or file and select the grey star to make it turn yellow. To view your starred items, click the star icon in the top right corner.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Starring requests and files that you need to work on makes it easy for you to create a to-do list on the fly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slack_to-do_list_stars.png?width=669&amp;amp;name=Slack_to-do_list_stars.png" alt="Slack_to-do_list_stars.png" title="Slack_to-do_list_stars.png" width="669" style="width: 669px; height: 182px;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;21. Shake it off with a shruggie.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Don't know the answer? Made a little mistake? Need to signal to your coworker that you actually have no idea what's going on this meeting? Send 'em a shruggie.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Serving as the "&lt;a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/05/the-life-and-times-of-%C2%AF_%E3%83%84_%C2%AF"&gt;default Internet feeling&lt;/a&gt;," a shruggie will say everything you need to say ... without saying anything at all. To pull it up, enter the &lt;strong&gt;/shrug &lt;/strong&gt;command.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Shruggie.png?width=427&amp;amp;height=140&amp;amp;name=Shruggie.png" alt="Shruggie.png" title="Shruggie.png" width="427" height="140" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;22. Edit your name in your profile to show when you're OOO.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're OOO on vacation or out on maternity or paternity leave, you can signal this to your coworkers by adjusting your last name on Slack. For example, I'd change my first name to "Carly Stec," and add "OOO" in the last name field -- as seen in the example below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To edit your name, click your team name in the top left corner to open up the Team Menu. Then, select "View Profile &amp;amp; Account" to open the team directory and click "Edit" to open the profile editor.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignCenter shadow" src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OOO.png?width=561&amp;amp;height=359&amp;amp;name=OOO.png" alt="OOO.png" title="OOO.png" width="561" height="359" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;23. Host a video call.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Want to have a video chat with one of your Slack groups or a thread of multiple people? You actually don't need to use an outside video service to do it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To start a video call, go to a thread that you'd like to chat with and click on the phone near the Slack search bar.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slack%20Video%20Call%20Phone%20Symbol.png?width=834&amp;amp;name=Slack%20Video%20Call%20Phone%20Symbol.png" alt="Slack Video Call Phone Symbol" width="834" style="width: 834px;"&gt;A call will start immediately, like it would on Skype or Zoom. From there, you can similarly turn audio and video on and off, or share your screen with your team.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;24. Make a note for your thread.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you don't feel like sharing a separate Google doc with your whole thread, you can make a note right on Slack. To do this, simply click the plus sign next to the message area in your thread. Then click "Create New" and then "Post."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Create%20a%20post%20on%20Slack.png?width=1276&amp;amp;name=Create%20a%20post%20on%20Slack.png" alt="Create a post on Slack" width="1276" style="width: 1276px;"&gt;Once you click "Post," a writing box will pop up where you can create a document for your team. When you're done writing it, you can share it with a caption and title that describes what the it is.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;25. React to someone's message.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a message warrants a thumbs up, a laughing face, or a more traditional smiley. Next time your boss Slack's the team about a great thing you or your co-worker team, react to the message with an appropriate emoji to make the conversation more fun. Here's how to do it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you want to react to a message, hover over it with your mouse. Message options, including one that looks like a smiley face will show up.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Message%20options%20in%20Slack.png?width=402&amp;amp;name=Message%20options%20in%20Slack.png" alt="Message options in Slack" width="402" style="width: 402px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;When you click on the smiley face, you'll be able to see and search all the possible emoji options.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slack%20Emoji%20reaction%20options.png?width=640&amp;amp;name=Slack%20Emoji%20reaction%20options.png" alt="Slack Emoji reaction options" width="640" style="width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;Once you click on one, you will react to the message. The emoji will appear directly under it. From there, other users can click it to react with the same emoji, or find their own emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Identify &amp; Work With the Best Brand Influencers for Your Business</title>
      <link>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-influencer</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-influencer" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/instagram-influencers.jpg" alt="instagram-influencers" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;When I scrolled through Instagram this morning on my commute, I commented on a friend's post about her vacation, scrolled right past an advertisement for a comforter, and double-tapped an influencer's post about a skincare brand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I scrolled through Instagram this morning on my commute, I commented on a friend's post about her vacation, scrolled right past an advertisement for a comforter, and double-tapped an influencer's post about a skincare brand.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;That's the thing about influencers -- you follow them for a reason, so you don't mind interacting with their sponsored content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I don't follow this exact influencer because I'm interested in her skincare routine. Instead, I follow her because she's an editor of a major magazine that I enjoy reading, and her content interests me. Since I trust her opinion, I'd definitely check out any skincare brands she endorses.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even though influencer marketing is a well-known marketing channel by now, it's always important to reiterate that your customers trust the opinions of others -- and that majorly impacts buying decisions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In fact, nearly &lt;a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/influencer-marketing-statistics/#10-most-important-influencer-marketing-statistics-for-2019"&gt;90% of all marketers&lt;/a&gt; find ROI from influencer marketing comparable to, or better than, other marketing channels.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So how can you identify the right brand influencers to work for your business? First, it's important to know what a brand influencer is, and determine the best way to connect with them -- on, or offline.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you work for a SaaS platform company, odds are you won't be reaching out to Beyonce to promote your product. Even if she did want to work with you, her audience likely doesn't fit your target audience or buyer personas.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Reaching out to random people with thousands or even millions of followers is a very transactional way to go about an influencer marketing strategy. The strategy becomes transactional because your business is completely focused on the influencer's follower count, and the influencer takes on a product endorsement role, rather than being a brand ambassador.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A better way to do it is by putting your relationship with the influencer first. The number of followers they have shouldn't be nearly as important as their fit with your brand and how their content resonates with both your audiences. Often, these influencers will be involved with your business long-term if you customize your content to their brand as well, and prove that you value their partnership.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've defined an influencer, let's explore how to find the best ones for your industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Find Brand Influencers for Your Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How can you determine the right "fit" with a brand influencer? Business/influencer fit will become extremely important for your future collaborations, so be sure to nail down the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Figure out your target audience.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research"&gt;target audience&lt;/a&gt; can be split by many factors -- including demographic, geographic, and behavioral, to name a few. Common ways to segment an audience is by age, gender, location, behavior, lifestyle, values, and interests. As you begin to narrow your audience, you'll dive into the types of marketing strategies and content that will resonate most with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Determining your target audience will ensure that your audience is similar to that of your influencer's. Otherwise, your content will fall flat and won't inspire users to take action.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A great example of business/influencer fit is how many sportswear brands, like Nike and Puma, partner with popular athletes to create both products and content. If you're a fan of &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lebron-james-nike-deal-exceeds-1-billion-maverick-carter-says-2016-5"&gt;Lebron James, you probably already know he's sponsored by Nike&lt;/a&gt; -- and that partnership goes a long way for Nike's business.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Research Influencers.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the best place to research your influencers is on social media -- but let's break it down into more concrete steps.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to find the right brand influencers is to see if any are already talking about your business. Social monitoring or searching for your brand on social media sites are great ways to get started, and listening tools can help you find influencers who are already interested in your industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another tip for researching influencers is to search for relevant hashtags. If you're a health and wellness brand looking for an influencer, searching for "#health, #wellness, #sponsored, #ad" on Instagram will bring you to influencers who have already posted industry-relevant content. If you see a post that catches your eye, check out the rest of the influencer's engagement on other posts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that influencers can have smaller, devoted followings -- so don't turn away from someone just because they have fewer followers than what you initially had in mind. Additionally, look out for influencers who are already posting your competitor's brands, as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you see an influencer's post on Instagram that may resonate with your brand, try looking for similar profiles. Next to the "Follow" button on Instagram, there's a down arrow. By clicking the down arrow, you'll see a list of suggested users. Scroll through those and see if any might be willing to take you on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Determine relevance.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your own content. What is your brand's aesthetic, and what tone do you use in your copy? What are the underlying messages you're trying to communicate?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's important to see how aligned your influencer's content is with your own. Obviously, their social presence shouldn't be filled with posts exactly like yours, but their messaging should be similar since you are targeting a specific audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Engagement is also an indicator of relevance for your brand. If the influencer's audience isn't engaged with their content, partnering with your brand won't make a difference. It's important to figure out whether the influencer's followers are commenting and sharing their content, or just liking it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, do similar users return to comment and like content, time and time again? This implies the influencer's audience enjoys engaging with the influencer and likes the content she promotes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now that you've done your initial research, and hopefully conducted a list of possible influencers for your brand to work with, it's time to connect.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You want to reach out to influencers without seeming spammy or too transactional. Relationships are key, after all. And if you have a bad relationship with your brand influencer, odds are they won't continue to post on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Connecting with Influencers&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1. Reach out...strategically.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cold emailing or direct messaging an influencer isn't a great strategy for relationship building. If you have an interest in working with an influencer, try courting them first.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What I mean by this is, you should subscribe to their blog, follow all their social channels, and comment on their posts. Influencers work hard on their content, just like your business does. If you want an influencer to take notice of your business, you have to be interested in what they're doing, as well. Beginning a partnership by interacting on the channels you hope to work together on will demonstrate your interest.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some influencers have a presence on multiple social media platforms. It's your job to know how they want to be contacted for business partnerships. If they have a business email in their Instagram bio, that's likely the best choice. Alternatively, maybe they have an inquiries section on their blog. Whatever the case is, make sure to send a personal message that doesn't feel like it's been generated by a template.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Make a human connection.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sending messages into the digital universe is a scary feeling because you don't know when or if you'll ever hear back. Making a connection in the real world is much more actionable, and puts a face to your business.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you should go out and stalk your list of influencers until you meet in person.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you're serious about making a connection, try attending or hosting an influencer event.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Bringing influencers to you will make connecting with them much easier, and give them an opportunity to interact with your brand before agreeing to work with you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many marketers are learning to market themselves as well as their business. Hopefully, you've been growing your network, as well -- so you may already have connections to your influencers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have someone who is at the very top of your list, see if they're following someone you know. Maybe they've worked with a similar brand in the past, and you know someone on that team. The world is smaller than we think, and you might just be sitting on a goldmine of potential relationships.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Manage your outreach efforts.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like any other marketing strategy, influencer outreach should be organized and well-documented. The last thing you want is to accidentally reach out to the same influencer on four different platforms with the same message. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After reaching out, be sure to give an influencer some time before a follow-up. Just like in a sales pitch, you don't want to be overbearing or clingy. Be respectful of the influencer's time -- if they want to work with you, they'll respond to your outreach.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You should also be documenting what outreach strategies work for you. Maybe after a first email, you've found success in hopping on a call with potential influencers. Knowing what works for you will help you further develop your outreach strategy, and enable you to be more creative in the future.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To recap, brand influencers can help you:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Build and expand a devoted following&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Increase your word-of-mouth marketing efforts&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Bring in more sales, leads, and conversions&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create more human relationships with your potential customers&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The right influencers are inherently interested in your brand, believe in your mission, and are capable of communicating about your business eloquently.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on long-term relationships with your influencers will continue to build their knowledge of your company, and will bring the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sponsored-content-that-doesnt-suck" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Ultimate-guide-to-sponsored-content.jpg" alt="Ultimate-guide-to-sponsored-content" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.ipglab.com/2016/09/23/ipg-media-lab-forbes-evaluate-the-current-state-of-branded-content/"&gt;people remember branded content twice as long&lt;/a&gt; as they remember a traditional advertisement. But creating your own branded videos, blogs, or podcasts can require a lot of bandwidth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve always wanted to experiment with &lt;a href="/agency/branded-content?_ga=2.187379240.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;this strategy,&lt;/a&gt; but haven’t had the time or resources to produce your own campaigns, sponsoring content from other companies or influencers might be the right strategy for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But creating your own branded videos, blogs, or podcasts can require a lot of bandwidth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve always wanted to experiment with &lt;a href="/agency/branded-content?_ga=2.187379240.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;this strategy,&lt;/a&gt; but haven’t had the time or resources to produce your own campaigns, sponsoring content from other companies or influencers might be the right strategy for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored content has been around for decades and got its start in print publications. But as online marketing has taken over the way we consume content, we’ve seen sponsorships move from print to web. Now, sponsored content is even thriving &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-get-sponsored-instagram?_ga=2.187379240.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;on social platforms like Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But, you might ask, "What makes sponsored content more appealing than traditional online ads?"&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, this post will explain what sponsored content is. We’ll also offer you a few best practices and solid examples of sponsored videos, podcasts, social media, and blog format. At the end, we’ll also give you a few tips on how to sponsor great content while still following federal advertising guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This type of content is most engaging when you sponsor a company or influencer who targets your core audience and already discusses topics that align with your brand. When this is done right, any mention of your brand feels like a natural fit rather than an invasive advertisement.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking they just saw an advertisement, audiences should come away from sponsored content feeling like they’ve learned something interesting. This makes your brand look more credible, memorable, and -- most importantly -- trustworthy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to branded or sponsored content, trust is a major factor that engages potential customers. In fact, when marketers sponsor content from a trusted publisher, they see a &lt;a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2016/quality-branded-content-outperforms-pre-roll-advertising/"&gt;50% higher brand lift than marketers who make their own content&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As branded and sponsored content gains steam, research continues to show that marketing your product with quality content can be incredibly effective. In fact, content marketing gets &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics"&gt;three times more leads&lt;/a&gt; than paid search advertising.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Distinguish Sponsored Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although sponsored content is engaging and effective, it still occasionally gets confused with more-traditional native ads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Native advertising is when a brand creates editorial content that centers around their product. Then, they might pay a website or publisher to share it in a way that naturally flows within a list of content on their homepage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of a native ad that appeared on Huffington Post’s homepage. Aside from the advertisement attribution under the headline, the post about senior entitlements is designed to show up on the page just like a regular news story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Native%20ad%20offers%2012%20senior%20discounts.jpg?width=615&amp;amp;name=Native%20ad%20offers%2012%20senior%20discounts.jpg" alt="Native ad offers 12 senior discounts" width="615" style="width: 615px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;When you click it expecting a regular post, you’re sent to a branded article that purely highlights services and discounts from Money Nation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Full%20page%20native%20advertisement%20offering%20senior%20discounts.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;name=Full%20page%20native%20advertisement%20offering%20senior%20discounts.jpg" alt="Full page native advertisement offering senior discounts" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you might want to consider a native ad that goes directly to a product page for immediate sales or traffic purposes, leading readers down a conversion path too soon could turn off audiences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since people may scroll past or tune out when they see content that’s obviously created by an advertiser, a piece of sponsored content created by a trusted source might be a stronger alternative.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re ready to start sponsoring content, it can still be difficult to come up with a list of content ideas or identify brands that you could sponsor. To help inspire you, here are a few great examples.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsored Content Examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sponsored Photo or Video Content&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Most consumers &lt;a href="https://research.hubspot.com/content-trends-global-preferences?_ga=2.220792472.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;want to see videos from brands&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s no surprise that video and photo content are gaining attention from sponsors. Here are three great examples of video and photo posts:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michelob Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Michelob recently sponsored a Tastemade recipe video which used the beer as an ingredient in a shrimp ceviche tostada dish. The video shows how the beer is used as a flavoring ingredient and lists its name in the video caption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;

   &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;"&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;In this example, Michelob was able to sponsor relevant content and get a natural product plug without altering Tastemade’s video recipe style.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Another great thing about this content is that it doesn’t just cater to beer drinkers or Michelob-specific fans. Someone who doesn’t drink beer regularly, but wants to cook this recipe as shown, might still have a reason to purchase Michelob Ultra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the small-business world, a local restaurant might sponsor a recipe video like this created by a food blogger to show off a meal they cook at their restaurant. You might also see a food or ingredient vendor similar sponsor a recipe video where there ingredients are listed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nude by Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3VdMt30qVg"&gt;Youtube video&lt;/a&gt;, a Global Ambassador from &lt;a href="https://nudebynature.com/"&gt;Nude by Nature&lt;/a&gt; gives a tutorial to a beauty reporter from the &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/"&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/a&gt;, a London newspaper.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/F3VdMt30qVg" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This type of sponsorship works well because it aligns with the editorial style of the Evening Standard’s beauty section.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This type of sponsored tutorial could be helpful to companies that offer beauty supplies. An expert demonstration on how to use a certain brand of products may be valuable to readers who enjoy wearing makeup and learning about new brands.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some viewers might even want to buy the exact same products that they saw in a tutorial so they can follow along and recreate the model’s look on themselves.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seedip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This Instagram post from Imbibe, a blog that informs users of interesting alcoholic beverages, shows off photos of &lt;a href="https://seedlipdrinks.com/us/shop/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuKC43pSX4wIVOffjBx1BQgeWEAAYASAAEgK97fD_BwE"&gt;Seedip&lt;/a&gt;, a non-alcoholic spirit.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The caption directs audiences to the account’s bio where they can find the link to a recipe that includes Seedip as an ingredient. It also describes the drink and uses hashtags like #sponsored to signal that the content was paid for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dognamedstella/" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;"&gt; Stella • LABsurdity Dogumented&lt;/a&gt; (@dognamedstella) on Jul 1, 2019 at 6:32pm PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is another example of how sponsoring content from a brand that aligns well with yours can create a more natural feeling campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This type of sponsored style might be helpful to other companies in the food and beverage industry. For example, if a local wine brewery sponsored a restaurant’s social post which highlighted a new line of wines, this could help the wine brand gain awareness and potential purchases from the restaurant’s followers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sponsored Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Podcasting is growing. In fact, in 2018, we discovered that &lt;a href="https://www.stateofinbound.com/?__hstc=20629287.cab3817eb1b5faffb5392bbfd33f8603.1562113918749.1562113918749.1562113918749.1&amp;amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1562113918750&amp;amp;__hsfp=2707452779"&gt;17% of marketers planned to add podcasting&lt;/a&gt; to their strategy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While big brands like &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lifeafter-the-message/id1045990056"&gt;GE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/podcast/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; have already created their own shows, other marketers have focused on sponsoring podcasts that relate to their field or have a similar target audience. Sponsoring a podcast allows marketers to gain awareness from listeners without having to put time and effort into creating their own content from scratch.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are two examples:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise and Grind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/pods/rise-and-grind-with-daymond-john"&gt;10-episode podcast series&lt;/a&gt; was sponsored by ZipRecruiter and hosted by Shark Tank’s &lt;a href="https://daymondjohn.com/"&gt;Daymon John&lt;/a&gt;. The series ran in correlation with the launch of John’s book, also titled &lt;a href="https://daymondjohn.com/pages/rise-and-grind"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rise and Grind&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The content aligned well with both John and ZipRecruiter as it included interviews from entrepreneurs and business leaders, career and interview tips, and motivational advice. ZipRecruiter is occasionally mentioned, but the content is mainly editorial in nature.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one of the podcast’s mini-episodes, titled “Motivational Minute: Take the Shot.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style="border: 1px solid #dedede; margin: 0px auto; display: block;" src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/164845/53946107" width="493" height="335" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For companies in B2B or highly-professional fields, sponsoring a podcast that features executive-level tips and advice allows your audience to see how in touch your brand is with its industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A sponsored podcast might also inform new audiences with similar interests about your brand when they tune in to hear an interview.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Brother, My Brother and Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/02/when-my-brother-my-brother-and-me-used-totinos-pizza-rolls-to-take-product-placement-to-the-extreme.html"&gt;The My Brother, My Brother and Me&lt;/a&gt; podcast, also known as MBMBaM, is a comedic show that touches on news and pop culture. When they have a sponsor, they come up with a topic that relates to the advertiser or use product placement strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable and extreme examples was in 2016 when they hosted a “Family Fun Hour” sponsored by Totinos. During the episode, they gave a brief history of Totino’s, discussed their favorite snacks from the company, and played games that included Totino’s foods. This was considered as a brand new strategy at the time and was noted on &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/02/when-my-brother-my-brother-and-me-used-totinos-pizza-rolls-to-take-product-placement-to-the-extreme.html"&gt;sites like Vulture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div class="hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube"&gt;
 &lt;iframe class="hs-responsive-embed-iframe" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tDSE4yqfiBY" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While this is an unusual example where product placement takes up most of the show, it demonstrates how content creators can develop something unique and still centered around a product.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sponsored Influencer Content&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="https://mediakix.com/blog/influencer-marketing-effectiveness/#gs.cwxh8w"&gt;80% of marketers report&lt;/a&gt; that influencer marketing is an effective strategy.&amp;nbsp; While many marketers have taken part in &lt;a href="/marketing/best-cobranding-partnerships?_ga=2.215147287.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;co-marketing&lt;/a&gt; with influencers, some have also sponsored their content.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the platforms where influencer marketing thrives most is &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few examples of how brands are sponsoring influencer content on the platform:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CR7 Footwear Sponsors Cristiano Rinaldo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this post, Cristiano Rinaldo, &lt;a href="/marketing/most-instagram-followers?_ga=2.211873428.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;a soccer star and the most-followed person on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, shares a picture of himself relaxing in CR7 Footwear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cristiano is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/By-tdE4Ag5E/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;no stranger to sponsored posts&lt;/a&gt; and he has mastered the art of natural product plugs. Because the photo shows him lounging and reading a book, rather than just his shoes, fans might feel like they're seeing a behind-the-scenes photo of him, rather than a promotion.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Since Cristiano is a major athlete and influencer who's recommended apparel in the past, viewers of this post might trust and follow his shoe endorsements, even if the footwear isn't athletic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While the sponsorship of an athlete seems ideal for companies that sell sporting goods or clothing, this placement shows how a major influencer can successfully promote a number of products that aren't just limited to their industry.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coach Sponsors Selena Gomez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example where &lt;a href="https://www.coach.com/shop/sale-women?viewAll=true&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgezoBRDNARIsAGzEfe66Q2l7Gk3OSjoP88TdCvu4I_F5Q1uG5u7tfajxPeX3P_PVMEZkF4caAvCjEALw_wcB"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; sponsored an Instagram post from Selena Gomez, the &lt;a href="/marketing/most-instagram-followers?_ga=2.178324004.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;former most-followed person on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of sponsor and promoter alignment. Coach is a high-fashion company and Selena Gomez regularly shares her outfits and thoughts about fashion on her social platforms. To viewers, this might feel like her usual posts where she casually shares what she’s wearing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On a smaller scale, this sponsored content strategy could be helpful for ecommerce stores or boutiques who want to promote their products by paying someone with a large following to take photos with them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lulus Sponsors Lexi Mars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers?_ga=2.220471832.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;Influencer Lexi Mars&lt;/a&gt; has published a few sponsored Instagram posts for Lulus. In these posts, she puts on a few of their outfits and shows off other accessories from the brand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like other influencers on this list, &lt;a href="/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers?_ga=2.220471832.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;she tags Lulus in her posts&lt;/a&gt;. This enables her fans to visit their account, learn more about their brand, and potentially follow them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the video post below, she tries on dresses from Lulus and captions the video as "outfit ideas for graduation."&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like the Selena Gomez example, this sponsorship aligns well with both the clothing company and the influencer's brands.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lexi regularly posts pictures of her outfits and videos with fashion tips, so this video will not seem unusual or forced to her fans. The style of clothing is also similar to the outfits she wears in other pictures, so fans who remember her usual fashion choices might not be disrupted by the ad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because Lexi also highlights that these are graduation outfits, she might engage members of her following who are graduating, as people searching Instagram for graduation dress inspiration.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This type of influencer strategy might be helpful to boutiques, physical stores, or ecommerce shops that want to promote their seasonal or event-related clothing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tractor Supply Sponsors A Dog Named Stella&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this sponsored post from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dognamedstella/?hl=en"&gt;@ADogNamedStella&lt;/a&gt;, Stella’s owner films her exploring s &lt;a href="https://www.tractorsupply.com/"&gt;Tractor Supply&lt;/a&gt; store with her family. In the video, the dog and children play with toys and items on the shelves and there are ample shots taken around the store. The video also shows friendly staff playing with the dog.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although there are some detailed shots of the store, this video is still focused on telling the dog’s story, which makes the content a bit more interesting than a generic marketing video.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dognamedstella/" style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px;"&gt; Stella • LABsurdity Dogumented&lt;/a&gt; (@dognamedstella) on Jul 1, 2019 at 6:32pm PDT&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By sponsoring the content of a popular dog influencer, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dognamedstella/?hl=en"&gt;who has over 284,000 followers&lt;/a&gt;, Tractor Supply might be spreading awareness about its products to dog owners and dog lovers that might not know they sell items other than landscaping supplies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many sponsored pieces, which often highlight online services on products, this content also creatively shows off a physical business. Sponsored content like this could be an effective way to show off products in a small or local shop that doesn’t offer an online store just yet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sponsored Articles&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/marketing/online-advertising?_ga=2.246071812.1605180896.1561986422-1582690004.1559596502"&gt;Sponsored articles&lt;/a&gt; have been around for years. While they were common in print publications, they have easily made the jump to blogs and online news sites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to a study by &lt;a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/03/08/nielsen-mode-media-study-reveals-branded-content-best-practices"&gt;Neilsen and Mode Media&lt;/a&gt;, consumers spend 2.5 minutes reading a sponsored article. That’s roughly the same amount of time that they spend reading a standard editorial piece.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one example of sponsored article content &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/sponsored-content"&gt;from Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Number&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In a piece sponsored by the &lt;a href="https://www.sleepnumber.com/?acid=psbrand&amp;amp;ascid=Google%2BNational-_-google-_-BRAND_Sleep_Number-_-SN_Brand_Exact-_-354786972454-_-e-_-aud-386305076833:kwd-300082267-_-mediacode-_-Brand-_-Brand&amp;amp;key=sleep%20number&amp;amp;s_kwcid=AL!6200!3!354786972454!e!!g!!sleep%20number&amp;amp;k_clickid=go_cmp-49429884_adg-13866925404_ad-354786972454_aud-386305076833:kwd-300082267_dev-c_ext-_prd-&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgezoBRDNARIsAGzEfe67AbbwtB0GkS1Wyb-luqZq_2HzitQKbCyy-_U8JpByHD3u_g9odOMaAv4CEALw_wcB"&gt;Sleep Number&lt;/a&gt; mattress company, Huffington Post readers are offered &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sleep-iq-quiz_n_5621370"&gt;a quiz and a slideshow&lt;/a&gt; on the science of sleep.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Sponsored%20content%20from%20Sleep%20Number%20discussing%20Sleep.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;name=Sponsored%20content%20from%20Sleep%20Number%20discussing%20Sleep.jpg" alt="Sponsored content from Sleep Number discussing Sleep" width="600" style="width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the native ad from Huffington Post that was shown above, this piece has the same design as all the other editorial posts on the website. It also has editorial newspegs and credibly sourced information including a fact from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the meat of the post, there is only one mention of Sleep Number. They also include sponsorship language at the end rather than in the middle or at the beginning. This makes the post feel more editorial and less like an ad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This example seems like it would be of value to audiences who want to learn more about the science of sleep.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The quiz and scientific facts also make it feel more engaging and credible. A user who reads this or takes the quiz might think that Sleep Number is a go-to mattress company because they’ve been affiliated with editorial content about sleep.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sponsoring editorial content like this could be a good strategy for businesses with an audience base that has interests in reading news or blogs online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, a gym might sponsor a piece on fitness tips for the elderly in the health section of their local newspaper. With a piece like that, audiences who visit the newspaper site or pick up the physical paper might learn more about why staying fit is important and decide to join the gym.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FTC Sponsored Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even though sponsored content might be more valuable to a customer than a traditional ad, it's still legally considered a form of advertising and is subject to specific guidelines. You’ll still need to follow the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/advertising-and-marketing/online-advertising-and-marketing"&gt;Federal Trade Commission’s online advertising and marketing guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On social media platforms, acknowledging that content is sponsored can get tricky. In 2017, the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/04/ftc-staff-reminds-influencers-brands-clearly-disclose"&gt;sent more than 90 letters and published an online announcement&lt;/a&gt; reminding influencers and brands to clearly state when they have a “material connection” to a brand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This means that a company or influencer must disclose when another company has given them a payment or another resource in return for publishing an endorsement or sponsored content&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To avoid any regulatory issues, many influencers and brands now use a hashtag such as #ad or #sponsored on social platforms if there is no other way to clearly disclose a sponsorship in a post. Hashtagging seems to be a go-to on Instagram, which currently has over 2.5 million posts marked with “#sponsored.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you should take time to read up on all the FTC requirements that could impact your campaigns, here are the biggest guidelines to keep in mind when posting or publishing sponsored content:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Make sure the content is free of &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/advertising-and-marketing/online-adve"&gt;any misleading claims or lies&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a supplement company shouldn’t say their vitamins cure a disease when they have not proven to do so.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Even if you are posting on social media, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/04/ftc-staff-reminds-influencers-brands-clearly-disclose"&gt;clearly disclose when content is sponsored&lt;/a&gt; and who the sponsor is. With this disclosure, audiences will know that some aspects of the content were paid for.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If your content is on your website or your sponsor’s, make sure the font of the disclosure is legible. The text and color should be easy to see and ideally different from the body copy’s style. A note that content is an advertisement, sponsored, promoted or presented by a company &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/native-advertising-guide-businesses"&gt;should appear in the post itself&lt;/a&gt; as well as near the headline if a CTA for it is featured on a homepage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: We're not lawyers, and the above shouldn't be taken as legal advice. Consult a legal professional.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Creating Sponsored Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When working with a sponsor to create interesting and compelling content, here are a few tips to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Aim to sponsor content that attracts and delights your audience. If it’s enjoyable, they’ll continue to consume it and potentially click on your links.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;When looking for the content creator, choose a company, influencer, or publisher with a similar audience or mission. If people see an endorsement or sponsored post from an entity they trust, they’ll be more aware of a product and more likely to buy it. This will also make any plugs or product mentions feel less like an ad.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Work with the sponsor to pick a topic that aligns with your goals and your audience’s interests. For example, if you’re a makeup company, sponsoring an influencer’s tutorial that highlights your products might be beneficial.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Focus on creating engaging content first and product plugs second. If you’re content feels like it’s solely advertising a product, people might tune out.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Sponsor content that goes beyond blog formatting. Be sure to consider videos, photos, and podcasts. These three areas are gaining more and more interest from marketers and consumers alike.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored content can allow you to reach new audiences and gain valuable trust from prospective customers. But, unlike native ads, you don’t have to sacrifice your team’s bandwidth to create it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you start looking for someone to sponsor, keep an eye out for people or brands that align with your mission and feel like a natural fit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
