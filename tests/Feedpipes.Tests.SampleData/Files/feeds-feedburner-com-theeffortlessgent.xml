<p class="lead">Tired of wearing dark denim &#8211; or even light wash jeans &#8211; in the summer months? Still liking the idea of stylish trousers in favor of wearing shorts off-duty all the time?</p>
<p><strong>You’re looking, in that case, for a pair of stylish chinos like the<a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos</a>, the very definition of the perfect pair of summer pants.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Now, that’s a lot of praise, but we think they can more than live up to your sky-high expectations.</p>
<p>It’s the blend of quality and versatility that makes these <a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olive chinos</a> a prime addition to our ever-growing list of <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/?s=style+staples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effortless Gent Style Staples</a>. This is the sort of gear that you can mix and match with ease in just about any style situation (like these olive chinos with a blue chambray shirt &#8212; but more on that later).</p>
<p>There’s plenty of reasons to pick up the Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos while we’re still in the throes of summer, rest assured. Why do you need them now? Read on, my friends.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16993 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool.jpg" alt="EG Style Staples: Flint and Tinder Cool Olive Chinos" width="1200" height="1200" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool-768x768.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<h2>Exactly Why You Need the Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos</h2>
<p>The Cool Chinos are the ultimate replacement for your dark blue or black denim. They provide every bit of polish and versatility without the discomfort of getting around in the heat wearing heavy denim.</p>
<p>Because &#8211; as much as we love a good pair of jeans &#8211; your legs need a break every now and again.</p>
<p>The Cool Chinos live up to their name right from the get-go with their high-twist cotton yarn construction, geared to provide breathability and also durability. The value you get from a classic pair of chinos is nearly unmatched &#8212; they’re wearable on the weekend and during the work week in equal measure.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olive chinos</a> offer a way to shake up <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/summer-clothes-for-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your summer style</a> without missing a beat. They can be worn to the office and on the weekend, and every guy needs at least one pair of pants like that in his Lean Wardrobe.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16996 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_bar.jpg" alt="EG Style Staples: Flint and Tinder Cool Olive Chinos" width="1200" height="1200" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_bar.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_bar-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_bar-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_bar-768x768.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_bar-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>What’s more, it’s worth it to invest a little more in a pair of chinos made with quality fabric and versatility in mind. Spending a shade under $100 is a step up from a bargain bin pair of chinos, one that pays off in spades.</p>

<p>Plus, they’re more unique than a standard pair of chinos. The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos</a> strike the right balance between modern and classic, thanks to an olive color that’s every bit as wearable as your favorite inky blue denim (with none of the added weight, to boot).</p>
<h2>What Makes the Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos Unique</h2>
<p>These <a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olive chinos</a> feature a sleeker fit than classic men’s chinos and an upgraded fit compared to the pleated chinos you wore back in the day (and perhaps have been guilty of wearing more recently than that &#8212; we’ve all been in that boat!).</p>
<p>They toe the line between modern and laidback with a slim fit that doesn’t stray into “rock star-skinny” territory.</p>
<p>This is crucial to keeping them in our Style Staple category; we’re all about items that you can wear in more than one way, and the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos</a> fit the bill.</p>
<p>We already mentioned the use of high-twist yarn, which lends them a more breezy feel than other chinos in your wardrobe (typically made of heavier cotton twill, in some cases).</p>
<p>These chinos are also a crucial pickup given the unique shade of olive &#8212; granted, there are other olive chinos on the market, but none with the detail that this Flint and Tinder pair bring to the table.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16995 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_pocket.jpg" alt="EG Style Staples: Flint and Tinder Cool Olive Chinos" width="1200" height="1200" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_pocket.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_pocket-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_pocket-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_pocket-768x768.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cool_chinos_pocket-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>Slash pockets reinforce the chino design, making it easy to slide a slim leather wallet in your pocket without throwing off the silhouette of your entire ensemble.</p>
<p>They’re also made in America, a relative rarity among chinos these days &#8212; especially chinos that’ll set you back less than $100.</p>
<p>That USA-made quality is evident when you dig into these F&amp;T chinos, with details like a custom shotgun shell button and durable zip fly. This is a no-fuss, no-frills pair of chinos, to be sure, and one that delivers the goods at that.</p>
<p>The list of positives runs on and on. So while the olive color remains a strong frontrunner, we wouldn’t be against picking up multiple pairs of the Cool Chinos in additional colors.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos are a worthy Effortless Gent Style Staple. Maybe you’ve even got a pair waiting for you in your shopping cart.</p>
<p>All of that being said, let’s not put the cart before the horse &#8212; here’s exactly how you can style these <a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slim olive chinos</a> to get the most out of them.</p>
<h2>How to Style Your Olive Chinos from Flint and Tinder</h2>
<p>Olive chinos can be an extremely versatile part of your wardrobe. That’s because olive is a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/tips-for-matching-colors-outfit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menswear neutral</a> &#8211; one of the basic colors you can use to create a Lean Wardrobe.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go classic and casual: </strong>Wear the Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos with a timeless <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-chambray-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chambray shirt</a> &#8212; just add suede chukkas, and perhaps a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-denim-jacket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep indigo denim jacket</a>. Wear that ensemble darn near anywhere you want (but especially to a weekend lunch date).</li>
<li><strong>Take things up a notch: </strong>Mash up your favorite navy cotton blazer with a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-white-ocbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white Oxford shirt</a> and <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-leather-loafers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brown leather loafers</a> for a sleek, office-ready look.</li>
<li><strong>Dial it down: </strong>The same chinos you favor for the office and can also be worn easily on your off-the-clock time &#8212; the Flint and Tinder Cool Chinos work quite well with a rugged short-sleeve henley and white canvas high-top sneakers.</li>
<li><strong>Team them up for travel: </strong>Take a merino T-shirt, add some broken-in leather Chelsea boots, then grab your <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-carry-on-bag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weekender bag</a>. That’s easy, functional travel style for a long day on the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>If at first you were skeptical of these <a href="https://effgnt.co/2M23DVP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olive chinos</a>, we hope we changed your mind. They could just become the most versatile pair of trousers in your closet. You only need to try ‘em out for yourself to find out why.</p>

<p class="lead">I received an email a few weeks ago with a great question.</p>
<p><strong>A young man named Nick wanted to know how to dress well as a teenager when everyone around him at school dresses ultra-casual &#8211; think basketball shorts, cargo shorts, T-shirts, and hoodies.</strong></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17001" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gmailImage.png" alt="Young Man Style: 4 High School Style Tips (That Work at the Office Too)" width="3584" height="2278" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gmailImage.png 3584w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gmailImage-300x191.png 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gmailImage-768x488.png 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gmailImage-1024x651.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3584px) 100vw, 3584px" />
<p>Nick wants to dress sharp with a more grown-up style. Maybe rock some chinos, an OCBD, or a stylish sweater. But he isn&#8217;t sure how to pull it off. Plus, he’s worried about his new style standing out too much.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Probably &#8211; because I get this same question from grown men who work in casual office environments too. They’re sick of looking like they just rolled out of bed and straight into their cubicles. They want to dress up a bit for the office &#8211; but without sticking out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>This is not a problem exclusive to teenagers. The earlier you learn to take control of your style and do so with confidence, the better off you’ll be in the long run.</p>
<p>But I get it. It’s easy for me to tell you, <em>&#8220;Just do it!&#8221;</em> But putting it into practice? That’s a whole different thing.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m sharing 4 tips about how to dress well for all you teenage guys out there struggling with your style &#8211; that means you, Nick.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>

<p><strong>Are you a reader in your 20s, 30s, or older?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You should still read this article. </strong>These tips apply to men of all ages, especially when you want to dress sharper than the casual crowd around you.</p>
<h2>Tip #1 &#8211; Change Just One Item</h2>
<p>Let’s say your current go-to school outfit is basketball shorts and a navy hoodie. You can take that oversized, shapeless hoodie and step it up with a navy sweater instead.</p>
<img class="wp-image-17002 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-sweater.jpg" alt="teenage style upgrade -- wearing a navy sweater instead of a navy hoodie" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-sweater.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-sweater-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-sweater-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-sweater-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p class="smallctr smalllink">Oversized hoodie → Fitted navy sweater</p>
<p>We’re not talking anything too crazy or different. You can even keep the basketball shorts (for now… though you probably won’t want to if your top half is already looking super sharp). <strong>Just by changing one item &#8211; ditching the hoodie for a fitted sweater &#8211; you’re already starting to elevate your look.</strong></p>
<p>What if you tend to wear a plain cotton T-shirt? Change it up by adding a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-chambray-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chambray shirt</a> on top. The resulting look is still casual, but adds interest. And it’s a good way to experiment with layering without looking too formal.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep swapping out one item in every outfit. Eventually, you’ll develop a new wardrobe full of upgrade pieces that elevate your style. And since you’re doing it a little at a time, the change won’t be as shocking.</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples of one item swaps you can make to improve your high school style:</p>
<img class="wp-image-17004 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shorts-1.jpg" alt="teenage style upgrade -- wearing chino shorts instead of basketball shorts" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shorts-1.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shorts-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shorts-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shorts-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p class="smallctr smalllink">Basketball shorts → Fitted chino shorts (<a href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-mens-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A few summer favorites.</a>)</p>
<img class="wp-image-17005 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shirt.jpg" alt="teenage style upgrade -- wearing a polo shirt instead of a graphic shirt" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shirt.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shirt-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shirt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-shirt-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p class="smallctr smalllink">Graphic T-shirt → Casual fitted polo (<a href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-mens-polos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our top picks.</a>)</p>
<img class="wp-image-17006 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-jeans.jpg" alt="teenage style upgrade -- wearing dark denim instead of faded, baggy jeans" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-jeans.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-jeans-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-jeans-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/swap-jeans-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p class="smallctr smalllink">Faded baggy jeans → Fitted dark denim (<a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-dark-denim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A great pair, plus how to style them.</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tip #2 &#8211; Take Your Time</h2>
<p>This is not a race. You want a smooth transition into your new style &#8211; not a sudden crash.</p>
<p>A subtle style transition that takes shape over the course of several weeks or months is best. Nothing too jarring or obvious. No sudden changes from shorts and a hoodie to a suit and tie.</p>
<p><strong>Think of your goal as updating your style with as much subtlety as possible. </strong>You want people to be impressed by your style, not surprised by it. The perfect reaction is: <em>“That looks great on you!”</em> You want to avoid: <em>“What are you wearing?!”</em></p>
<p>So move slowly and steadily towards your goal &#8211; resist the urge to sprint.</p>
<h2>Tip #3 &#8211; Embrace Trends</h2>
<p>You’re young. You’re in high school. You deserve to enjoy the way you dress. <strong>This is the perfect time to embrace trends and try out any new style you think looks cool.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s be honest &#8211; one day (much too soon) you’ll feel like you&#8217;re too old to pull off the trendiest fashions. So take advantage now while you can.</p>
<p>What’s hot in the music, movies, and celebrity culture you love? Is there a specific artist or star whose look you’d like to try for yourself? Go for it!</p>
<p>If you decide you don’t love it, you can always go back to the classics. But you just might find your favorite new outfits this way. When you&#8217;re young, having fun with fashion is all about experimenting with trends and discovering your favorite look. Don’t be afraid to be the trendsetter at your school.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quick note to the older guys:</em></strong> Yes, you can experiment with trends too. Maybe not like a rockstar or in outfits means for teens, but definitely with thoughtful details that update your style and show that you’re paying attention to what’s on trend in the menswear world.</p>
<h2>Tip #4 &#8211; Chill Out, People Don’t Really Care</h2>
<p>Reality check: Everyone is caught up in their own world. They’re all obsessed with themselves. It’s true in high school. And it will still be true when you’re older and working at the office.</p>
<p><strong>So just go all in on the styles you love.</strong> Wear what you want and what you like. People don’t really care. But you’ll feel so much more confident and relaxed when you’re wearing something you love.</p>
<p>It’s true, some people will make negative comments. But that nonsense is really a reflection of their own lack of confidence.</p>
<p>When you stand out for looking your best, the naysayers are naturally going to worry about their appearance. Their negativity comes from a fear that you’re dressing better than they are &#8211; which you probably are. 😉</p>
<h2>You’re Young! Enjoy It!</h2>
<p>Experiment with your style while you&#8217;re still a young man. Get to know yourself as a person in the process. You can easily dial it back when you decide you’re not so into that last outfit you tried. No worries.</p>
<p>Eventually, you’ll nail down a solid personal style &#8211; one you can continue to craft and improve on as you get older. That way, you’re already ahead of the game with your grown-up style.</p>

<p class="lead">Do you dread the idea of putting on a stuffy dress shirt and tie to head to work in the dead of summer?</p>
<p><strong>Believe me, we’ve all been there. But we’ve got a stylish solution to make dressing for the office in the summer <em>much</em> more bearable.</strong></p>
<p>What’s that, you say? It’s too good to be true?</p>
<p>Not quite. <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YUBxPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twillory Performance Dress Shirts</a> are the perfect men’s summer dress shirts &#8211; with a multitude of options, high-minded performance details, and an office-ready design.</p>
<p>Every guy needs at least one go-to summer dress shirt that’s tailored and sharp. These shirts do the trick &#8211; whether it’s around the office or at a summer wedding.</p>
<p>Twillory’s Performance Dress Shirts are the latest <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/?s=EG+Style+Staples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effortless Gent Style Staple</a> for good reason. They’re sure to upgrade the way you dress for that next big presentation &#8211; even as the thermostat continues to climb.</p>
<p>What’s the scoop with Twillory? How could the brand change the way you get ready for work? Read on, my friends.</p>
<h2>Why You Need to Look into the Twillory Performance Dress Shirts</h2>
<p>Twillory has dialed in a recipe for success &#8211; they focus on stylish dress and casual shirts for men, crafted in performance fabrics in a variety of fits and styles. These shirts are a cut above for a reason.</p>
<p>The brand’s fits and fabric are next-level, running the style gamut. They go from casual shirts made to be worn untucked (the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2GbJZmI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Untuckables Collection</a>) to sharp summer dress shirts for men with plenty of performance-ready features (more on that in a second).</p>
<p><a href="https://effgnt.co/2YUBxPT"><img class="alignright wp-image-16969 size-medium" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Dress-Shirt-223x300.jpg" alt="men's summer dress shirts from Twillory" width="223" height="300" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Dress-Shirt-223x300.jpg 223w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Dress-Shirt.jpg 421w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></a>Twillory’s performance dress shirts are also easy to shop, often sold in bundles and in a variety of colors and patterns. That gives you plenty of reasons to pick up more than one.</p>
<p>After all, you’re going to need multiple office and off-duty shirts, right? So it’s best to get a shirt or two &#8211; or three &#8211; that pass muster.</p>
<p>Their prices are also agreeable, starting at $54 and available in the aforementioned bundles from $119 (for 2) and $175 (for 3).</p>
<p>But does the fit separate these summer dress shirts for men from the pack?</p>
<p>Why yes, yes it does.</p>
<p>Twillory’s Performance Dress Shirts come in chest and neck sizes, plus Tailored (slimmer through the body, shoulders, and chest) and Traditional options. So they’ve got something for everyone.</p>
<p>Perfect sizing and fit options, check.</p>
<p>A plethora of color and style options, check.</p>
<p>But again, the real reason you need at least one of <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YUBxPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twillory’s Performance Dress Shirts</a>? As far as men’s summer dress shirts go, they’re very likely better than whatever’s on your back or in your closet right now.</p>

<h2>What Sets Twillory’s Performance Dress Shirts Apart</h2>
<p>Your average dress shirt is either made of heavy cotton (for a distinct lack of breathability), or it’s so thin and poorly made as to be nearly see-through. Those are extremes &#8211; the goal is to land somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>And right in the middle? Quite possibly your new favorite men’s summer dress shirts? You guessed it: <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YUBxPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twillory Performance Dress Shirts</a>.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2NXGFSu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advisor Performance Stripe Shirt</a> &#8212; it’s your classic men’s dress shirt, featuring bold stripes that pop handsomely under a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/the-perfect-fit-blazers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navy cotton blazer</a> or a navy tropical wool suit.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2NXGFSu"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16966 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Banker-Stripe-Shirt.jpg" alt="Twillory Banker Performance Dress Shirt" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Banker-Stripe-Shirt.jpg 800w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Banker-Stripe-Shirt-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Banker-Stripe-Shirt-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Banker-Stripe-Shirt-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>
<p>But again, the difference is in the <em>details</em>.</p>
<p>We’re talking four-way stretch fabric that wicks away moisture and provides crucial breathability in the heat. That means you won’t sweat right through these men’s summer dress shirts as you would with a less technically advanced garment.</p>
<p>The blend of cotton and Twillory’s proprietary CoolMax spandex fabric also means it’s much more heat-ready than a heavy, starched cotton shirt.</p>
<p>Twillory’s line of Friday Shirts is no less remarkable in terms of fit, construction, and style potential. The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2xL0nWC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twillory Friday Shirt</a> &#8211; particularly in an eye-catching shade of pink &#8211; is the ideal way to switch up your rotation of men’s summer dress shirts. Try it with off-white chinos and a khaki cotton blazer.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2xL0nWC"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16967 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Friday-Shirt.jpg" alt="Twillory Friday Shirt" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Friday-Shirt.jpg 800w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Friday-Shirt-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Friday-Shirt-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Twillory-Friday-Shirt-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>
<p>The blend of knitted pique cotton, spandex, and breezy microfiber means this shirt &#8211; with a tie or on its own &#8211; is far from stuffy. Throw in the brand’s brushed nickel collar stays, and get ready for the compliments to roll in.</p>

<h2>How To Style Your Men’s Summer Dress Shirts</h2>
<p>We’ve touched on this above, but the great thing about men’s summer dress shirts from Twillory is the versatility and functionality &#8211; particularly in smart casual situations. Take on the day with these suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stand out from the crowd: </strong>Take the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2xL0nWC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twillory Friday Shirt</a> in a unique shade of pink &#8212; seriously, don’t be afraid to switch it up from white and light blue &#8212; and pair it with a navy knit tie, <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-leather-loafers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brown leather loafers</a>, and a khaki cotton suit. This works at the office or at your next summer wedding.</li>
<li><strong>Go classic: </strong>Pick up more than one of the <a href="https://effgnt.co/30BuJXI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SafeCotton Non-Iron White Twill Shirt </a>and never go unprepared for your next business trip. Try it with a sharp charcoal suit and dark brown leather brogues &#8211; plus that same navy knit tie.</li>
<li><strong>Switch up your smart casual ensemble: </strong>Start again with the <a href="https://effgnt.co/30BuJXI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SafeCotton Non-Iron White Twill Shirt</a>, add a lightweight navy cotton blazer, throw on your best pair of <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-dark-denim/">dark blue denim</a>, add some tan suede <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-chukka-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chukka boots</a> in the mix… call it a day. Business travel-ready, date night-friendly, and still sharp for happy hour when you call it quits.</li>
<li><strong>Go bold and versatile: </strong>Try the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2NXGFSu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advisor Performance Stripe Shirt</a> in a more unique style. We’re talking a khaki field coat and <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/how-to-wear-chinos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navy chinos</a>, plus dark brown suede Chelsea boots &#8212; think of it as a European-inspired take on the classic striped dress shirt.</li>
</ul>
<p>With so many options, we figure you can’t go wrong with Twillory’s Performance Dress Shirts. <strong>What’s your take on the newest Effortless Gent Style Staple? </strong></p>

<p class="lead">Gents, it&#8217;s <em>hot</em> out.</p>
<p class="lead">The minute you step outside, you feel the oppressive sun beating down and the moisture floating in the air. You’re doing your best to not melt down into a sweaty puddle on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re wiping your brow constantly; your clothes stick to your back, forming abstract sweat blots like a Rorschach test.</strong></p>
<p>How&#8217;s an effortless gent like you supposed to dress well <em>and</em> stay cool? This, my friend, is one of those situations where you <em>can</em> have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>You know how the clothing we wear in winter is generally heavier, darker, and more substantial? Same goes for the summer styles men look best in, except <em>the complete opposite</em>: everything is lighter, brighter, and lacking in heft and bulk.</p>
<p>Let’s break each one down:</p>
<h3 id="bestcolors">The best colors for summer clothes<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h3>
<div id="attachment_13141" style="width: 335px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13141" class="wp-image-13141 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/light-colors.jpg" alt="summer clothes for men - nantucket red shorts with a light blue button up shirt sunglasses and brown loafers" width="325" height="487" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/light-colors.jpg 325w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/light-colors-200x300.jpg 200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/light-colors-20x30.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13141" class="wp-caption-text">Via <a href="https://lookastic.com/men/trends/summer-2017-trends-in-menswear-5-tips-to-up-your-summer-fashion-game-164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lookastic</a></p></div>
<p>In general, you’ll want to <strong>wear light colors in the summer</strong>. Lighter colors will keep you cool as they reflect the most light. So white, light blue, light grey, and tan / khaki are all “neutrals” (i.e. colors that can serve as your base and go well with all other colors in an outfit).</p>
<p>Navy and olive also fall into the neutrals category, but since they’re not light colors, we’ll ignore them for now.</p>
<div id="attachment_13140" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13140" class="size-full wp-image-13140" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/colorful-accessories.jpg" alt="alessandro squarzi wearing blue check shirt and chinos with colorful accessories for men" width="590" height="885" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/colorful-accessories.jpg 590w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/colorful-accessories-200x300.jpg 200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/colorful-accessories-20x30.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13140" class="wp-caption-text">via <a href="http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-via-sirtori-milan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sartorialist</a></p></div>
<p>Summer is a great time to <strong>add brighter pops of color</strong> as well.</p>
<p>If you’re just learning how to incorporate more color, start by adding them in with smaller outfit details like pocket squares, bracelets, sunglasses, and watch straps.</p>
<p>If you’re more advanced and experimental, throw in a vibrant, stand-out piece, like a sport coat or <a href="/colorful-chinos-pants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">colorful chinos</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bestfabrics">The best fabrics for summer clothes<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h3>
<p>For men&#8217;s clothes for hot, humid weather, <strong>summer-weight or lightweight wool, linen, and cotton</strong> will be your best friends. Loosely-woven fabrics such as these will keep the air flowing freely while still looking sharp.</p>
<p>In case you’re worried about linen and wrinkling… yes, linen tends to wrinkle, but that’s OK. I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Embrace the wrinkles!</p>
<p>Plus, when you’re in hot, humid weather, the fabric will relax and some of the wrinkles will fall off anyway. But for summer styles, men don&#8217;t need to stress. It&#8217;s natural to experience wrinkles with this fabric, so it’s not a big issue.</p>
<h3 id="bestfit">How summer clothes should fit<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h3>
<div id="attachment_13142" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13142" class="wp-image-13142 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/looser-clothes.jpg" alt="loose summer layers mens grey t-shirt and off-white wrap waistband cream mens trousers" width="590" height="885" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/looser-clothes.jpg 590w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/looser-clothes-200x300.jpg 200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/looser-clothes-20x30.jpg 20w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13142" class="wp-caption-text">via <a href="http://www.thesartorialist.com/men/on-the-street-casual-friday-milan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sartorialist</a></p></div>
<p>In general, clothes should fit how they always do, no matter the season. However, for summer styles, men tend to prefer things <strong>a bit looser</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, your outfits should <em>still</em> be sharp, and should <em>still</em> have a nice, fitted silhouette… but if you want to go a tad bit looser, do it. More room between your skin and the fabric will allow for more air to circulate, which will keep you cooler, longer.</p>

<h2 id="whatclothes">Outfit Specifics: “What clothes should I add to my closet?&#8221;<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h2>
<p>Before recommending specific summer clothes or capsule wardrobes for you, first decide <em>how</em> you need to dress.</p>
<p>Do you need to dress more formally (maybe you have an office job that requires you to suit up) or casually (every other situation, from running errands around town to getting drinks and dinner with your Sig O)?</p>
<h2 id="formal">Formal and Business: How to wear a suit and tie in hot weather<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h2>
<p>If you’re required to wear a suit to work, you <em>will</em> get hot. Hopefully the AC doesn’t break down on your way to the office so you don’t cross the Sweat Threshold (my term for when you start sweating, and once reaching that point, you can&#8217;t stop).</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s a way around it, but there <em>are</em> ways to minimize how hot you get in your suit and tie. You&#8217;ll have to pay attention to <strong>the cloth and the color</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="suitfabric">&#8220;What kind of fabric should my summer suit be made from?&#8221;<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h3>
<p>Suits can be made from a number of different cloths. To keep it simple, for a men&#8217;s summer style suit, you want to <strong>find something in a lightweight wool, cotton, linen, or a blend of those three</strong>.</p>
<p>Ideally, your suit will be <strong>partially lined and unstructured</strong>. Suit jackets can come unlined, half lined (front panel, shoulders, and sleeves), or quarter lined (sleeves and shoulders, or sleeves only).</p>
<p><em><strong>Why this matters:</strong></em> Having a partially-lined jacket means there&#8217;s <em>one less layer trapping the heat in</em>, and less sweating for you.</p>
<p>If you head to SuitSupply (or any shop that knows suits) right now and ask to see their summer-weight suits, they will know what you’re talking about. Generally, the suits are lighter, both in weight and in color, and the weaves of summer-specific fabrics are more open.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why this matters:</strong></em> They breathe better, more air gets through, and you stay cooler.</p>
<h3 id="suitcolors">&#8220;Are some colors better than others for summer suits?&#8221;<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h3>
<p>As far as specific fabric color, if appropriate for the event or the venue, I’d go with a light to medium grey suit, tan, cream, or brighter blues. Again, it’s going to depend on where you’re headed, as far as what’s appropriate, so you&#8217;ll have to make a judgment call there.</p>
<p>Your classic charcoal and navy could also work, but I tend to get hotter in darker colors and I imagine most others feel the same way. Then again, they’re classics for a reason, and you can’t go wrong with muted, somber colors such as these. If you stick with lighter-weight fabrics like I discussed in the previous section, you should be okay, temperature-wise.</p>
<h3 id="shirtstiesshoes">&#8220;What about shirts, ties, and shoes?&#8221;<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h3>
<p>Same goes for your shirts. There are plenty of dress shirt fabric options, but find one made from a lightweight, open weave cloth. The most common and easiest ones to find will probably be <strong>lightweight oxford and linen cotton blend shirts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Shirt colors:</strong> The staple white and light blue, of course. You can also go with a subtle stripe in blue / white or grey / white if you’re aiming for maximum versatility. As far as stripe width, I personally prefer the candy and awning <a href="https://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/showthread.php?86994-Common-Shirt-Stripes-Defined" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stripe widths</a>, though it’s up to you. You can also go with more vibrant colors, which work great against a neutral grey, navy, or tan.</p>
<p><strong>For ties</strong>, what’s most important is to keep it seasonally consistent. So no thick wool ties. Go with something lighter weight in wool, cotton, and silk. Knits are also a good option for men&#8217;s summer style dress clothing.</p>
<p>As far as<strong> shoes for business or formal wear</strong>, stick to an oxford in brown or black. If you have a bit of leeway, you can go with a tassel loafer.</p>
<h2 id="summercasual">Smart, Sharp Casual: How to dress sharp in men&#8217;s clothes for hot, humid weather<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h2>
<p>Smart, sharp casual describes outfits you&#8217;d wear in everyday life situations that aren&#8217;t any of the two extremes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Formal: black tie, white tie, or business environments</li>
<li>Casual or Activity-specific: lounging at home, performing manual labor, or participating in a physical activity (sports, the gym)</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you’re not sitting on the couch, mowing the lawn, or doing 5 sets of 5 in the squat rack, you would be dressing smart sharp casual.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to buy clothes and want a smart, sharp casual men&#8217;s summer style, look no further! Here are some suggestions below.</p>
<h3>Shorts</h3>

<p>3 pairs of shorts, either in linen (or linen blend) or cotton chino. Best colors would be a lighter blue, darker blue, and one in a brighter color, like this faded red. Standard khaki-colored chino shorts are also great to own, of course.</p>

<p>2-3 pairs of chinos. These look sharp and are much better in warm weather than heavy denim. You can&#8217;t go wrong with navy, medium grey, khaki, and one fun color like faded red or mint green.</p>

<p>2-4 shirts. I love linen shirts in the summer. I also wear a lot of OCBDs (year round, really) in white and light blue, or a light stripe (grey and white, blue and white).</p>

<p>2-4 short sleeve shirts: I&#8217;d go with linen, cotton, or a blend, in either short-sleeve button-ups or polos. For polos, slub cotton is my favorite (which is what you see above), but basic pique works too. Can&#8217;t go wrong with a white, navy, or gray, and two others in fun color and pattern combinations.</p>
<p>Remember, with a <a href="/lean-wardrobe-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lean wardrobe</a>, having one stand-out piece is easy to incorporate because it will go well with all your other neutral colors.</p>

<h3>Sportcoat</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13147" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_jackets.jpg" alt="the best summer sportcoats" width="1600" height="636" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_jackets.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_jackets-300x119.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_jackets-768x305.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_jackets-1024x407.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_jackets-30x12.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>These are three examples of super versatile sport coats: one in a medium grey, one in a brighter blue, and lastly, one in a brown check.</p>
<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d have all three, but depending on your specific men&#8217;s summer style, you may not need all three (or maybe you need <em>more</em>, who knows). The best sport coats for summer are linen or a linen blend, usually with cotton, wool, or silk. They&#8217;re also half-lined, unstructured, 2-button single-breasted, and double-vented. Double vents are my preference, though it&#8217;s not imperative yours be double-vented.</p>
<p>If you have your classics covered, don’t be afraid to experiment with pattern and texture, even if it&#8217;s subtle.</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13152" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_socks.jpg" alt="best no-show socks for men" width="1600" height="678" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_socks.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_socks-300x127.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_socks-768x325.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_socks-1024x434.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_socks-30x13.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>In the summer, I go with <a href="/no-show-socks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no-show socks</a> or shoe inserts. The ones you see above are my favorites.</p>
<div class="panel callout">
<p><strong>Shop Here:</strong> For inserts, I go with <a href="https://amzn.to/2kIoEpz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zederna cedar inserts</a>, or <a href="http://amzn.to/2soHvef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pedag Deo-Fresh inserts</a>. For no-show socks, I like <a href="http://fave.co/2tqZNK1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Falke</a> and <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/socks-and-tights/no-show-socks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniqlo&#8217;s</a> no-show socks.</p>

<h3>Undershirts</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13155" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_undershirts.jpg" alt="best mens undershirts for summer" width="1600" height="612" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_undershirts.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_undershirts-300x115.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_undershirts-768x294.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_undershirts-1024x392.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/c_undershirts-30x11.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>I like my undershirts to be invisible; I don&#8217;t even want to know I&#8217;m wearing one.</p>
<p>I look for shirts made from a thin cotton or cotton blend (sometimes synthetic too, i.e. the shirt on the right), in light grey, with a V-neck. This is the style you want to wear underneath light-colored and lightweight shirts; they won&#8217;t show through like white undershirts tend to do.</p>
<p>These are my two favorites.</p>

<h3>Accessories (optional)</h3>

<p>If you already have a standard pair of black or brown tortoise shell frame sunglasses, go with something fun and colorful for summer.</p>

<p>In the summer, I usually travel with a straw fedora. They look great, provide sun protection, and best of all, are packable&#8230; assuming you buy the right ones.</p>
<div class="panel callout">

<p>A dark brown leather belt is always good to have; it will match all your shoe options. Sometimes, though, you want something a little more fun, especially in the summer when you want to wear more color. So, something like these braided, webbed belts are the perfect men&#8217;s summer style.</p>

<h4>NATO straps</h4>

<p>You can usually swap out the factory band on your watch and replace it with a colorful NATO strap. It&#8217;s an easy way to add a bit more color to your outfit without going full pink seersucker or something equally in-yo-face.</p>
<div class="panel callout">

<h2 id="summeroutfits">Putting together your summer outfits<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h2>
<p>I think the best advice I can give for putting together great outfits every day can be summed up in three words: <strong>Don&#8217;t Be Scared</strong>.</p>
<p>Every question I receive from guys about how to put together outfits always sound so anxious and apprehensive, like if they wear the “wrong” combination, they’re going to set off a bomb or something equally terrible will happen.</p>
<p>The most common questions are usually something like, <em>“How do I wear X with Y?”</em> and <em>“Does A go with Z?”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The answer to #1 is: Put on X first, then put on Y.</li>
<li>The answer to #2 is YES</li>
</ul>
<p>You simply can’t go wrong with a wardrobe full of neutrals, and 1-2 pops of bright, vibrant color&#8230; nor can you go wrong with an outfit of solid colors, and 1-2 patterns.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to sound harsh, but look, you’re supposed to <strong>have fun with dressing well</strong>. If you put together a less-than-ideal look, and you don’t realize it until later, who cares? <em>It’s just clothing</em>. Put stuff on, have fun with your men&#8217;s summer style, go on with your day.</p>
<p>And by the way, YES, you can wear a long-sleeve linen or OCBD with shorts. Just roll up your sleeves if you’re hot. Don’t be so buttoned up, it’s summer, for god’s sake.</p>
<h2 id="outfitexamples">Men&#8217;s summer style examples<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h2>
<p>Anyway, because I love you, here are a few outfits I threw together from the pieces I suggested for your summer capsule wardrobe in the previous section.</p>
<h3>Outfit 1: Laid-Back Dressed Up</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13160" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit1v2.jpg" alt="laid back dressed up mens outfit" width="1600" height="758" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit1v2.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit1v2-300x142.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit1v2-768x364.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit1v2-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit1v2-30x14.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>This is a good example of a laid-back version of &#8220;dressed up&#8221;. The khaki chinos and light blue linen shirt are an easy pair, and with the brown drivers, is a great outfit on its own. The multi-colored brown webbed belt is a subtle color addition, along with the shades.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re headed to a nice venue (dinner at a classy restaurant, drinks at a fancy bar), throw on your blue sport coat, and you&#8217;re all set.</p>
<h3>Outfit 2: Poolside Happy Hour</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13136" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit2.jpg" alt="poolside outfit sharp summer clothes with light green pants white shirt loafers sunglasses and fedora" width="1600" height="750" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit2.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit2-300x141.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit2-768x360.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit2-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit2-30x14.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>This outfit reminds me of a night out in Miami; it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d wear if I&#8217;m going out to grab happy hour drinks and bites at <a href="http://cecconismiamibeach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cecconi&#8217;s</a> (best HH in Miami Beach).</p>
<p>Notice how the chinos are the only bright pop of color (not including the shades, but that&#8217;s OK); everything else is subtle and neutral.</p>
<h3>Outfit 3: Sharp in Shorts</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13137" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit3.jpg" alt="summer outfit with shorts linen shirt sneakers and panama hat" width="1600" height="718" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit3.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit3-300x135.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit3-768x345.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit3-1024x460.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit3-30x13.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>Shorts <em>can</em> be sharp! Find a dark pair in linen or cotton, pair it with a white linen shirt, clean white sneakers, and a tan fedora. Sunglasses optional (but it&#8217;s summer, so you probably are carrying them around everyday regardless).</p>
<h3>Outfit 4: Understated and No-Nonsense</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13138" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit4.jpg" alt="simple mens outfit with dark blue pants and grey polo loafers sunglasses and colorful belt" width="1600" height="752" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit4.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit4-300x141.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit4-768x361.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit4-1024x481.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit4-30x14.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of understated, no-nonsense looks, this outfit is for you. Dusty navy chinos, a grey slub cotton polo, and tan loafers. Super easy, you look sharp, and you still have a bit of color in that outfit with the awesome belt and shades.</p>
<h3>Outfit 5: Al Fresco Dinner</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13161" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit5v2.jpg" alt="dressy summer outfit for men with light green chinos white shirt and tan sport coat with brown loafers belt and sunglasses" width="1600" height="758" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit5v2.jpg 1600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit5v2-300x142.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit5v2-768x364.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit5v2-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/outfit5v2-30x14.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />
<p>I wanted to throw this example in to show you how to dress up colorful chinos. Essentially, you treat them as if they were your standard khaki or navy, but the key is to make sure everything else is subtle and neutral. I&#8217;m a fan of fun shades, so if that&#8217;s another pop of color you happen to be wearing, that&#8217;s totally fine.</p>
<h2 id="wrappingup">Wrapping Up<span class="smalllink"><a class="backtotop" href="/summer-clothes-for-men/#top">Back To Top</a></span></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far, you&#8217;re ready to dress sharp in men&#8217;s clothes for hot, humid weather!</p>
<p>Now you have a good idea of what fabrics and colors to choose, and how your clothes should fit when it&#8217;s warm out. You also have a solid list of clothing recommendations and ideas for how to put them together into different outfits.</p>
<p>Dressing well isn’t tough, regardless of the season. You just have to be strategic with what you wear and the cloth you choose, so you can look great while still remaining as cool as a cucumber.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! Anything else I can answer? <strong>Leave your questions in the comments below</strong>.</p>

<p class="lead">The summer style train keeps rolling at Effortless Gent, folks &#8212; and today’s topic is one that’s seemingly simple, yet only on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>We’re adding to our EG Style Staples series with classic white sneakers &#8211; one wildly affordable, highly stylish, supremely timeless pair: <a href="https://effgnt.co/2XfToiN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeaVees Hermosa Plimsoll Sneakers</a>.</strong></p>
<p>These are quite possibly the best white sneakers on the market for your hard-earned dollars (and not a whole lot of ‘em, at that!).</p>
<p>White sneakers, particularly a low-cut version in a summer-friendly construction, are a helpful style building block. They also offer a way to switch things up from <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-leather-loafers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leather loafers</a>, <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-chukka-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chukka boots</a>, or boat shoes &#8212; or heck, even <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/brown-dress-shoes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leather dress shoes</a>.</p>
<p>With roots in sporting style, they’ve also got that touch of old-school cool going for ‘em. And the list goes on. Let’s get started.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16945 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SeaVees-Hermosa-Plimsoll-.jpg" alt="Classic White Sneakers - SeaVees Hermosa Plimsoll" width="438" height="446" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SeaVees-Hermosa-Plimsoll-.jpg 438w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SeaVees-Hermosa-Plimsoll--295x300.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" />
<h2>Why These Classic White Sneakers Are a Style Staple</h2>
<p>Every guy needs a pair of white sneakers in his closet, even if you dress up for the daily grind during the week.</p>
<p>The rest of the time, you just might find the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2XfToiN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SeaVees Hermosa Plimsoll Sneakers</a> become the most versatile footwear offering in your closet &#8212; and that’s no bull.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2XfToiN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16942 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_side.jpg" alt="Classic White Sneakers - SeaVees Hermosa Plimsoll" width="1200" height="1199" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_side.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_side-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_side-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_side-768x767.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_side-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>These classic white sneakers, especially in a hard-wearing poplin twill fabric (more on that in a second) are the right alternative in every situation that calls for sneakers &#8212; outside of the gym, that is.</p>
<p>They step up your style without overdoing it &#8212; these are an affordable workhorse pair of sneakers. So you won’t have to stress about scuffing them up.</p>
<p>And for sportier, sneaker-appropriate occasions, they’re a heck of a lot sharper than the pair you typically wear to the gym.</p>
<p>These sneakers are an easy grab-and-go pair. They’re not overpriced or difficult to <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-white-sneakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">style with your menswear neutral wardrobe</a>. And they’re rugged enough that they won’t fall apart from a bit of real world use.</p>
<p>Plus, this basic style has been immortalized in popular culture. Classic white sneakers have the staying power that matches well with similar style staples &#8212; like the <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-white-ocbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford shirt</a> or <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/how-to-wear-chinos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tan chinos</a>.</p>
<p>That’s what we call a true style essential around EG. And what’s more, they’ve got heritage and history baked right in.</p>
<p>SeaVees has been making sneakers imbued with California cool for decades, and many styles call out memorable historical events. In the case of the <a href="https://huckberry.com/store/seavees/category/p/53402-hermosa-plimosoll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermosa Plimsoll</a> that event would be the first-ever skateboarding competition, held in August 1963 &#8212; hence the 08/63 designation.</p>
<h2>What Makes the SeaVees Hermosa Plimsoll Different</h2>
<p>They might look simple on the surface. But these classic sneakers &#8211; with their low-cut, West Coast-inspired touches &#8211; are worthy of consideration in your wardrobe.</p>
<p>For one thing, the poplin twill used on the uppers is what SeaVees calls “garment-quality”. That’s the sort of fabric that’s good enough to double as the material you’d find in one of your stylish shirts. And it makes them harder-wearing than thin canvas sneakers.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2XfToiN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16943 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_top.jpg" alt="Classic White Sneakers - SeaVees Hermosa Plimsoll" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_top.jpg 600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_top-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/seavees_hermosa_plimsoll_top-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>
<p>These aren’t sneakers to be kept in the box &#8212; wear them with tan chinos and a blue Oxford shirt. Or with a classic slub tee and <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-mens-light-wash-denim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light wash jeans</a> (more ideas below).</p>
<p>A few more details set them apart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comfort memory foam footbed for extra cushion</li>
<li>Gum rubber outsole for extra traction</li>
<li>Brushed antique brass eyelets</li>
</ul>
<p>Add these all together and you’ve got stylish sneakers that can go the distance.</p>

<h2>How to Style These Classic White Sneakers</h2>
<p>White sneakers are your answer for versatile, off-duty, casual style essentials. And this pair is designed for comfortable, all-day wear. But it’s not as simple as throwing them on with any old outfit&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Keep things classic: </strong>Match them with slim khaki twill chinos, a blue Oxford, and a tried-and-tested NATO strap watch &#8212; now you’re ready to grab a pint with your buddies.</p>
<p><strong>Dress ‘em down: </strong>White poplin sneakers are at their best when you don’t overthink it. Wear these with <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-mens-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tailored navy shorts</a> and a grey slub pocket tee &#8212; keep your NATO watch handy, too.</p>
<p><strong>Dress ‘em up: </strong>Mash up your classic white sneakers with a blue chambray shirt, a navy cotton blazer, and those same tan chinos &#8212; bingo, you’re ready for Casual Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Wear them to a music festival: </strong>Yes, really. Be it a massive festival, an outdoor amphitheater show, or a laidback lawn concert, these sneakers can go there (take it from someone who’s done it). Keep it casual with an <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/mens-military-jackets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">olive green military jacket</a> to combat evening breezes. Then throw on a grey slub tee and light wash jeans. Get me a beer while you’re over there, will ya?</p>
<p>So, what’s your take? What’s your favorite pair of white sneakers? How do you plan to style this pair?</p>

<p class="lead">As a former shy guy, I had no choice but to learn how to be socially confident.</p>
<p><strong>If not, I wouldn’t have had any idea how to put myself out there. And my life would have been much lonelier.</strong></p>
<p>Let me give you a clearer idea of how rough my situation was. My family and I immigrated to Canada from the Philippines when I was 17 years old. I didn’t really speak English at that point. And I was 60 lbs. overweight with crippling social anxiety.</p>
<p>After graduation, I got a job as a structural designer at an engineering company. That required me to sit in front of a computer 40 hours a week. My interactions with co-workers were limited to work-related questions.</p>
<p>Even though I was making good money, I was tortured by the feeling that something was missing. I knew that I was missing out on a big part of life because I couldn’t develop meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel in control of my life and it frustrated the hell out of me. Finally, I was motivated to make a change.</p>
<p>Today &#8211; after many years of learning through trial and error &#8211; I have more confidence, more dates, and more friends.</p>
<p>By the way&#8230; my name is Myke Macapinlac and I help STEM professionals create meaningful connections in their personal, romantic, and professional lives.</p>
<p>I’m the host of the Social Confidence Mastery podcast where I interview a variety of experts to help listeners improve their social confidence. I’ve also published a <a href="https://socialconfidencemastery.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">variety of books</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to share my personal journey with you and my best tips on how you can successfully go from shy to social.</p>
<h2>Tip 1: Learn The Fundamentals</h2>
<p>You talk to people everyday. That’s why learning how to be socially confident is one of the best skills you’ll ever acquire.</p>
<p>Still, you may need help to see where the gaps in your social abilities lie and to find the best ways to improve them.</p>
<p>As a social skills coach, this is something that I’ve noticed with all my past students. They would tend to dedicate immense time and resources to learning technical skills &#8211; all while completely neglecting their communication skills.</p>
<p>To prove my point, consider <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/student-loans/average-cost-of-college" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this interesting bit of research</a>: The average cost of college for the 2017–2018 school year was $20,770 for public schools (in-state) and $46,950 for nonprofit private schools.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for education to help you succeed professionally. But if you’re willing to invest in your career, why wouldn’t you do the same to help you succeed in building relationships with others?</p>
<h2>Tip 2: Start Small</h2>
<p>After working with hundreds of technically skilled guys in the past, I noticed that they shared one key factor that stopped them from making positive changes in their social lives: they were totally overwhelmed.</p>
<p>With so much information available online, it’s easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis. That’s why I recommend that you lower the bar for yourself, set small goals, and develop your social confidence one skill at a time. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a total beginner, focus on making eye contact and smiling at strangers when you’re out and about.</li>
<li>After that, say hello and try to engage them in small talk.</li>
<li>Once you’re comfortable doing that, see if you can hold a longer conversation.</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16915" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-beautiful-business-attire-2422280.jpg" alt="How To Be Socially Confident - 5 Tips That Work" width="3600" height="2711" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-beautiful-business-attire-2422280.jpg 3600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-beautiful-business-attire-2422280-300x226.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-beautiful-business-attire-2422280-768x578.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-beautiful-business-attire-2422280-1024x771.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3600px) 100vw, 3600px" />
<p>This approach works because it teaches you systematically. You begin with something easy and keep doing it until you’re a pro. Once you feel comfortable, you can move on to the next step. Keep doing this until you reach your social goals.</p>
<p>Doing this is so important because nothing feels better than making progress. Start small, manage your expectations, and be patient. The results are worth it.</p>
<h2>Tip 3: Allow for Errors</h2>
<p>You will make mistakes. But not only is that OK, it’s also totally normal.</p>
<p>Have some self-compassion. Don’t beat yourself up when you make a mistake. Remember, you’re doing the best you can in your current circumstances.</p>
<p>Watch out for negative self-talk and reframe it into something more encouraging. Be your own cheerleader and give yourself a pat on the back whenever you take positive action to reach your goals.</p>
<p>Your anxiety can get the best of you if you try to control things that you can’t. So focus on what you can do and let go of the rest.</p>
<p>When you adopt this mindset, you’ll find joy in your journey towards becoming more socially confident.</p>
<h2>Tip 4: Change Your Environment</h2>
<p>Be mindful of the company you keep &#8211; these individuals have a significant impact on the kind of person you become. With time, you’ll naturally adopt the mindset and behaviors of the people you’re around frequently.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16916" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blur-brainstorming-chatting-1881333.jpg" alt="How To Be Socially Confident - 5 Tips That Work" width="6000" height="4004" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blur-brainstorming-chatting-1881333.jpg 6000w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blur-brainstorming-chatting-1881333-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blur-brainstorming-chatting-1881333-768x513.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blur-brainstorming-chatting-1881333-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" />
<p>So if you want to become more outgoing, talkative, and charismatic, keep company with socially confident people. Pay attention to how they think and how they do things. Be around them as much as possible and aspire to emulate them.</p>
<h2>Tip 5: Seek Mentorship</h2>
<p>The fastest way to get good at something is to find someone who has already achieved what you want and get them to show you how to reach the same goal.</p>
<p>Working with someone competent can get you to your goals much quicker because they’ll keep you accountable and give you specific feedback.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16917" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-casual-chairs-935949.jpg" alt="How To Be Socially Confident - 5 Tips That Work" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-casual-chairs-935949.jpg 2048w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-casual-chairs-935949-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-casual-chairs-935949-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/adult-casual-chairs-935949-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" />
<p>Reading books, listening to podcasts, and watching videos around this topic are all fine. There’s nothing wrong with self-education. But in my experience, my results skyrocketed when I decided to work with an expert.</p>
<p>Remember, time is your most valuable asset. We all have a strict budget of 24 hours a day. You can make the most of that precious resource and fast-track your social success by learning from someone who’s been in your situation and has achieved the results you want.</p>
<p>By working with a <a href="https://socialconfidencemastery.com/social-skills-coach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social skills coach</a>, you’ll get to your goals much quicker than learning things on your own. You’ll save time, money, and the frustration of learning just through trial and error.</p>

<h4>What comes to mind when you think of stylish shorts? Well-fitting. Slightly above the knee length. Classic fabric and design.</h4>
<p><strong>The best men&#8217;s shorts should be as well-cut and well-made as your favorite pair of trousers &#8212; it’s 2019 after all, and that’s within the realm of possibility.</strong></p>
<p>Consider the alternative. You’ve seen it. Baggy, sloppy cargo shorts that we’ve all worn (some &#8212; myself included! &#8212; for far too long).</p>
<p>But the rules of wearing shorts are a bit different nowadays. Shorts are no longer the last resort, throw-it-on-and-hit-the-road move they might have been in the past.</p>
<p>No sir, the best men’s shorts for summer have just enough personality and style to work for any guy. Even if you don’t consider yourself a “shorts guy,” we’re here to change your mind. In fact, the best men’s shorts have a tailored fit to rival that of your favorite chinos, not to mention construction that is every bit as high-quality.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t go swapping in shorts for chinos in <em>every</em> outfit… but we would definitely recommend you wear these shorts with classic summer style staples, from a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-mens-polos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">navy polo</a> and <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-white-sneakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white sneakers</a> to a grey slub tee and leather moccasins.

<h4>Welcome to the latest entry in the EG Style Staples series, now with a seasonally friendly bent: the short sleeve henley.</h4>
<p><strong>It’s something every guy should have in his Lean Wardrobe &#8212; the type of gear that can be mixed and matched throughout the seasons and worn with ease in multiple situations.</strong></p>
<p>For summer, it’s hard to top the casual versatility and rugged appeal you get with the short-sleeve henley &#8212; it’s a shirt that looks great on every guy.</p>
<p>Since the thermostat is probably starting to climb in your neck of the woods, now is the perfect time to introduce you to the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a>.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16832 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fZgmttIY5j_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_0_original.jpg" alt="Flint and Tinder Short-Sleeve Henley" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fZgmttIY5j_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_0_original.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fZgmttIY5j_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_0_original-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fZgmttIY5j_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_0_original-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fZgmttIY5j_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_0_original-768x768.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fZgmttIY5j_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_0_original-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p>This is a one-of-a-kind shirt you’ll want to wear all season long. Just as with <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/eg-style-staples-flint-and-tinder-365-pants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder’s 365 Pants (profiled previously in this series)</a>, you’re going to like what you see.</p>
<h2>Why You Need the Flint and Tinder AirKnit Henley</h2>
<p>You might be thinking to yourself, “Why do I need another T-shirt? I’ve got a dresser drawer full of ‘em!”</p>
<p>First, zero in on and refine the tees you <em>really, truly </em>wear. After you’ve done that, you might find your wardrobe is missing a spot that the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> can fill: a rugged and versatile layer for spring and summer.</p>
<p>The henley has roots in sporting culture, first worn by rowers in England in the town of Henley-on-Thames (a fun fact for your next trivia night, perhaps). That’s why the short-sleeve henley of today retains its rugged good looks and appeal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> is a true winner in every sense of the word. The three-button placket on this shirt is critical for elevating it above a standard tee. And we love that the fit is trim and flattering but not overly tight.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16833 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UyTdr6qibC_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_4_original.jpg" alt="Flint and Tinder Short-Sleeve Henley" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UyTdr6qibC_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_4_original.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UyTdr6qibC_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_4_original-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UyTdr6qibC_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_4_original-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UyTdr6qibC_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_4_original-768x768.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/UyTdr6qibC_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_4_original-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p>We’d say you should try it on and see for yourself, but you’ll have to order it to do that… so, go ahead!</p>
<p>This rugged henley is a cut above your average T-shirt in every aspect. It’s premium in a way that makes it possible to be worn on its own.</p>
<p>Compare that to your beloved gym shirts or college tees… sadly, those aren’t going to work for a casual happy hour session of patio beers. But the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> absolutely will &#8212; and that’s why you need it, simple as that.</p>
<h2>What Sets This Henley Apart &#8212; Big-Time</h2>
<p>If you’ve copped any Flint and Tinder gear from Huckberry in the past (from the brand’s excellent hooded sweatshirts to its essential <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/eg-style-staples-flint-and-tinder-365-pants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">365 Pants</a>), then you know what I’m talking about: made-in-the-USA quality and attention to detail. In this case, that results in a henley made with what the brand calls the “cashmere of cotton.”</p>
<p>The fabric is remarkably soft yet not flimsy &#8212; 100% Supima cotton (a softer weave) makes it possible. Thanks to the way it’s knit and garment-dyed, the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> is breathable too &#8212; critical for summer.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16834 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MCDLQuIN1E_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_1_original.jpg" alt="Flint and Tinder Short-Sleeve Henley" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MCDLQuIN1E_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_1_original.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MCDLQuIN1E_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_1_original-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MCDLQuIN1E_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_1_original-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MCDLQuIN1E_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_1_original-768x768.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MCDLQuIN1E_flint-and-tinder_supima_air_knit_henley_1_original-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p>All of that means this henley is so much more than your average T-shirt. It fits well, it breathes tremendously even in the heat of summer, and you get an upgraded look via the classic henley construction.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s easy to find the perfect fit &#8212; just use the sizing chart to get a sense of which one is right for you, from S to XXL.</p>
<p>And then there are the versatile colors in which you can snag this henley. Dusty Blue looks particularly appropriate for spring and summer, as does the ever-wearable Navy. Feel free to buy more than one.</p>
<h2>How to Style the Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</h2>
<p>The great thing about a rugged henley is that it’s surprisingly more versatile than you might expect. The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> has a decidedly smarter vibe than a slouchy T-shirt &#8212; all thanks to the soft, premium cotton. The trick here is to not overthink it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go casual and straightforward: </strong>Wear the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> with your favorite pair of <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-mens-light-wash-denim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light wash jeans</a> and high-top canvas sneakers &#8212; that’s it!</li>
<li><strong>Layer it up. </strong>Pair your short-sleeve henley with a denim or <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-chambray-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chambray shirt</a> and <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-tan-khaki-chinos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tan chinos</a>; keep those same high-top sneakers on hand for a weekend coffee run.</li>
<li><strong>Dress it up… slightly. </strong>Wear the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> under a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/the-perfect-fit-blazers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cotton blazer</a> with <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-dark-denim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slim dark denim</a> to the office &#8212; throw some suede chukka boots in the mix to nail casual Friday.</li>
<li><strong>Show it off with some edge. </strong>Getting a bit breezy at that outdoor festival? Throw on a beat-up moto jacket or an <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-denim-jacket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">indigo denim jacket</a> with your best pair of black jeans &#8212; easy as can be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a doubt, the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2YDH5he" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flint and Tinder Supima AirKnit Henley</a> is a worthy EG Style Staple. Let us know which color you pick up and how you like it this summer.</p>

<p>We’re here to help you find the best men's polos for spring &#038; summer - and to rethink how you wear them for the perfect smart casual look.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://effortlessgent.com/best-mens-polos/">The Best Men’s Polos for Spring and Summer</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://effortlessgent.com">Effortless Gent</a>.</p>
<h4>The best men’s polos aren’t like the polos you wore back in middle school, high school, and maybe even college.</h4>
<p><strong>We’re here to help you rethink how you wear your polo and the brand’s you turn to for that summer staple.</strong></p>
<p>The polo shirt tends to get a bad rep. Too preppy, not versatile, too stuffy, etc. Yet, modern polos are made the right way, for the right time (any time at all this spring and summer, in fact).</p>
<p>Today’s best men’s polos have a dash of edginess mixed with a touch of the familiar and classic. Polo shirts were once worn during actual polo matches, so it’s tough to stray too far from that athletic past.</p>
<p>Still, our favorite polos are refreshing in their approach, use of versatile fabric, and ability to upgrade any outfit. You’ve got to find a polo that fits the right way &#8212; slimming (but not overly tight through the chest and across the shoulders), with sleeves that hug (not strangle) your biceps.</p>
<p>Start with our picks, then keep dreaming up ways to incorporate the best men’s polos into your summer wardrobe.</p>
<h2>Relwen Stripe Pique Slot Button Polo</h2>
<a href="https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=109&amp;url=29653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16818 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/relwen.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/relwen.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/relwen-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/relwen-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/relwen-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p>It’s fitting that Relwen would make a heck of a great polo &#8212; after all, the brand takes traditionally rugged and classic styles (like the field jacket or the CPO jacket) and updates them in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>In the case of the <a href="https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=109&amp;url=29653" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Pique Slot Button Polo</a>, that means the dressier four-button polo placket is updated with bar tacks and woven tape, plus horizontal buttonholes for added reinforcement. The 100% cotton fabrication is breathable and comfortable &#8212; far from a traditional pique weave. $98</p>

<p>The best men’s polos are different in a few key ways &#8212; notably, the fabric and fit. With the use of functional, comfortable merino fabric, we think Proof hit the mark with their <a href="https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=109&amp;url=29654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">72-Hour Merino Polo</a>. It was designed to be worn through multiple outfits and adventures across a 72-hour period.</p>
<p>Choose from a range of neutral, wearable colors (we like olive the best), then be ready to break out this polo on a long cross-country flight &#8212; followed by happy hour at your destination, naturally. $72</p>

<h4>I remember the first necklace I ever owned. It was a tiny gold chain—small enough for a 5 year old’s neck—and a small rectangle charm with a capital D on it (for my first name, Daniel).</h4>
<p><strong>I don’t actually know the backstory of this necklace and charm, only that it’s had a persistent role in my childhood memories.</strong> My parents must’ve given it to me when I was young, and that was that. I just wore it without thinking much of it.</p>
<p>I recently visited home and happened to find this charm again. I’ve always kept it in a safe place with a few other necklaces and things I’ve stopped wearing over the years.</p>
<p>But even though I no longer wore them, I never wanted to get rid of them.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16780" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/necklaces.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/necklaces.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/necklaces-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/necklaces-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/necklaces-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p>I guess that’s what happens when you hold onto old things. Their age, in addition to the simple fact that you’ve held onto them for so long, is what makes them <em>special</em>.</p>
<p>When I see that charm, I think of my youth, of being a young kid growing up through middle school and high school, all the friends that have come and gone, the places I’ve visited, the experiences I’ve had… and even though I wasn’t always wearing this charm throughout the years, it’s become a symbolic representation of the memories of my past.</p>
<p>It’s been a constant in my life&#8230; something always within reach and full of my own personal history (or at least an easy reminder of it).</p>
<p>And so before leaving my parents’ place to head back to NYC, I threw it on a chain and started wearing it again.</p>
<h2>Be Intentional With Your Accessories (And Your Style!)</h2>
<p>So, why did I just tell you that story?</p>
<p>Well, it all ties in to this idea of <em>accessorizing</em>.</p>
<p>I want to convince you to start wearing accessories (if you aren’t already). But not just wear them… I want you to <em>think</em> about your accessories and make intentional decisions about <em>what</em> you wear.</p>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<p>I’m going to walk you through it all, and this thought process applies not only to accessories but your personal style as a whole, from your clothes and shoes, to your home, your lifestyle, the way you travel, etc., so you want to pay attention.</p>
<a href="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08798.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16768" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08798.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1090" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08798.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08798-300x273.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08798-768x698.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08798-1024x930.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>But thinking about and applying these ideas to all of those things all at once can be intimidating, so I want to make it much easier and focus on your accessories.</p>
<p>To simplify it even further, let’s focus specifically on bracelets.</p>
<p><em>Much</em> easier, right?</p>
<h2>Why wear accessories at all?</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>“What’s the point? Why bother accessorizing? Don’t I just need a watch and a wedding ring if I’m married? Why should I care at all?”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Look, I realize wearing accessories can seem pointless, “extra”, or maybe even intimidating and confusing—just like dressing better can seem to the uninitiated—but it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: wearing accessories is like adding chopped chives onto a plate of perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, or grating fresh parmesan cheese on top of a piping hot plate of pasta.</p>
<p><em>Accessories are the extra 10% that make your whole outfit.</em></p>
<a href="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CK1_5469.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16764" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CK1_5469.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CK1_5469.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CK1_5469-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CK1_5469-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CK1_5469-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>On top of that, it’s an easy way to express yourself, to make your entire look more interesting, and to show that you pay attention to the little details.</p>
<p>So before you decide to slap a bunch of shit on your wrists and fingers and call it a day, I suggest taking a more intentional approach.</p>
<p>And this means <strong>procuring and curating a nice set of accessories over time… all with an individual meaning to you.</strong></p>
<p>So what would be the best way to start?</p>
<h2>How to choose your accessories</h2>
<p>OK let’s bring our focus back to bracelets so we have a simplified example.</p>
<p>By the way, shout out to our friends at <a href="https://effgnt.co/egazurorep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azuro Republic</a> for partnering with us on this article! You&#8217;ll see examples of their incredible bracelets throughout. You&#8217;re also able to shop any of the bracelets you see by <a href="https://effgnt.co/egazurorep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visiting their site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So when you’re choosing a bracelet to wear, these are some things you may consider:</strong></p>
<h3>“What have I seen and liked?”</h3>
<p>Maybe you have a friend, an older brother, or an uncle who wears a cool bracelet that makes you think, <em>“Hmm… I kinda like that!”</em></p>
<a href="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08741.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16767" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08741.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08741.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08741-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08741-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08741-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>Maybe you saw someone online&#8230; whether it be some rando influencer on Instagram, a model, or a celebrity who had cool wristwear.</p>
<p>Sometimes, simply seeing someone wear a piece you like can inspire you to try it out for yourself.</p>
<h3>“What is the meaning behind this bracelet?”</h3>
<h4>Values and goals aligned with yours</h4>
<p>Sometimes you find a company who’s driven by values and goals that you align with, and you want to support them by wearing their product.</p>
<p>Azuro Republic is a good example of this. I loved what they had to say about their brand’s mission. Here’s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Our goal for Azuro Republic is to bring men of all kinds, races, and beliefs to come together under the common banner of gentlemanly conduct and values.</em></p>
<p><em>This is our own, unique way of changing the world for the better not only on an individual level, but on a global scale.</em></p>
<p><em>Taking it one step at a time and one person at a time, our goal is to effect a positive impact on the world and transform the face of the modern man will be better achieved when we all come and work together as one.</em></p></blockquote>

<h4>Designed with meaning</h4>
<p>Maybe the bracelet itself is designed with a specific meaning in mind, or the materials from which they’re made have a history or meaning behind it.</p>
<a href="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obsidian_logo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16766" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obsidian_logo.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obsidian_logo.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obsidian_logo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obsidian_logo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/obsidian_logo-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>For example, this bracelet is a classic bead bracelet made from 925 silver and a stone called obsidian, a naturally occurring volcanic glass. Specifically, this variety is referred to as Apache Tears, a rounded obsidian pebble.</p>
<p>Obsidian has been utilized by countless tribes and cultures over hundreds of thousands of years. <sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian">1</a>]</sup></p>
<p>Culturally, the name is derived from an old Apache tribe legend<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_tears">2</a>]</sup>, and in this bracelet, have come to represent guardianship and bravery.</p>

<h4>A wearable reminder or talisman</h4>
<p>Another thought: accessories can also serve as a reminder of a set of values you strive to embody or traits you want to adopt.</p>
<p>Azuro’s <a href="https://effgnt.co/2VENn2e">howlite bracelet</a>—howlite is a porous, naturally occurring white mineral—has been designed to symbolize purity, clear mindedness, and focus.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2Y0B2mm">silver classic Picasso jasper bracelet</a>, apart from being a stunner, is said to bring optimism and openness, attracting positive people and cleansing negative energy.</p>
<p>And by the way, even if you aren’t a particularly spiritual person, or believe in the “woo woo” meanings of things, we all strive to better ourselves, and having bracelets as wearable talismans can serve as constant reminders of what you’re working towards.</p>
<h4>A representation of a happy time and place</h4>
<p>Or perhaps it’s a bracelet you stumbled upon that now holds a lot of memories and meaning to you because of <em>where</em> you bought it, or a specific time in your life.</p>
<p>One of my most recent pickups was a braided red leather bracelet with a knot on one end and a loop on the other. I bought it at a little seaside shop in a small beach town in Mexico.</p>
<p>My wife Kate and I had the best time talking with the owner and listening to her stories. It also happens to be across the way from our favorite fish taco stand, just a stone’s throw away from the sand and surf.</p>
<a href="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/taco_beach.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16775" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/taco_beach.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/taco_beach.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/taco_beach-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/taco_beach-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/taco_beach-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p>We discovered these fish tacos 7 years ago during our first visit to this little town, which happened to be the day after I proposed to Kate. We haven’t been back since, so it was nice to visit (and yes, the tacos are still as delicious as we remembered).</p>
<p>On top of that, we were in Mexico to see two of our very good friends get married, and I happened to be officiating their wedding.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by meaning and memories.</p>
<p>Whenever I wear that bracelet—basically any time I leave the house—I’m reminded of these layers of moments across years of intertwined experiences, and <em>all of that</em> is what makes the bracelet so special to me.</p>
<h3>“How’s the quality, construction, and value?”</h3>
<p><em>How well was the bracelet made?</em></p>
<p><em>Does it feel solid and substantial, like it will stand the test of time?</em></p>
<p><em>Also, is there value in this piece?</em></p>
<p>Basically you want to ask yourself is, “Is what I’m getting worth at least what I’m paying, if not more?”</p>
<p>And in terms of actual cost, maybe you’re willing to pay more for something you consider to be of higher value, whether that be higher quality materials, unique or better construction, or simply a special meaning behind it, similar to my red leather bracelet.</p>
<p>In terms of quality materials and construction, Azuro Republic is a good example of this.</p>
<p>I have to say, when I first received this bracelet, I wasn’t immediately blown away. Maybe I didn’t get it. It was a beaded bracelet… great.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16769" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08974.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="850" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08974.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08974-300x213.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08974-768x544.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RC_08974-1024x725.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />
<p>But the more time I spent with it, looking at it closely and wearing it on my wrist, feeling the weight of the obsidian stone and observing the beautifully polished sterling silver, <em>I got it.</em></p>
<p>I appreciate the attention paid to each detail, down to the display box every bracelet comes in.</p>
<p>Understandably, Azuro Republic’s bracelets aren’t cheap. This isn’t some $2 wooden beaded bracelet you’ll find at a mall kiosk. And if that’s all you’re looking for, this wouldn’t be for you.</p>
<p>But if you’re looking for a piece to add to your collection, a bracelet that’s made from precious metal and stone, uniquely designed and thoughtfully crafted, and beautifully presented in its own case like a fine jewelry piece, Azuro’s bracelets are worth your consideration.</p>
<p>I’ve had several beaded bracelets throughout the years, but none quite this caliber of quality and substance. And if that’s important to you, definitely check them out.</p>
<p>There are several steps that go into designing and making their bracelets. They do a great job of describing each <a href="https://azuro-republic.com/blogs/articles/azuro-republic-craftsmanship-of-stone-bracelets?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=20190502_EG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artistic step here</a>.</p>
<h3>“Personal expression, man”</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you just <em>like</em> something. Or more specifically, you’re drawn to how a bracelet looks.</p>
<p>Or maybe that bracelet just makes you feel cool, or feel good when you wear it, or like you’re taking on a new persona, or maybe you just think it looks great with your outfit that day.</p>
<p>And that’s totally cool too!</p>
<p>You don’t need a specific reason or meaning behind your bracelet to wear it.</p>
<p>But, of course, if you’re procuring and curating your collection over the years, most likely, your items will have a specific meaning behind it…</p>
<p>&#8230;either one that it’s designed with, or one that has developed over time because of your relationship with it (like my D charm that I’ve had since I was 5).</p>
<p>My point is: <strong>whatever your reason for liking, wanting, or wearing that bracelet, <em>have</em> a reason.</strong></p>

<h2>How to wear accessories</h2>
<p>There’s no right or wrong way to wear bracelets, rings, or any combo of accessories.</p>
<p>I personally feel you can wear <em>too much</em>, but then again, some guys can pull it off, while others can’t.</p>
<p>You have to use your best judgement, and if uncertain, err on the side of fewer accessories than more.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple ways to combine your bracelet and other accessories.</p>
<h3>Look 1: Simple and Straightforward</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16797" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bracelets-solo.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1667" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bracelets-solo.jpg 2500w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bracelets-solo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bracelets-solo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bracelets-solo-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" />
<p>Let’s say you don’t wear any accessories at all. A bead bracelet from Azuro would be the perfect way to start.</p>
<p>It’s bold and eye-catching with meaning behind each bead. Plus, it’s all you really need if you’re going for a more minimalist look.</p>
<h3>Look 2: With a watch</h3>
<p>There’s a good chance you wear a watch, and maybe a wedding ring if you’re married.</p>
<p>Adding a bracelet is a great way to dip your toe into accessorizing, and all you need is one (but you’ll want more, trust me).</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16798" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final_bracelets-with-watches.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final_bracelets-with-watches.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final_bracelets-with-watches-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final_bracelets-with-watches-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final_bracelets-with-watches-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p>Wearing a bold bracelet like this is perfect because if you’re keeping it simple, then one accessory is all you need, and that alone makes an impact without being overwhelming.</p>
<p>Feel free to wear it on the same wrist as your watch, or on the opposite wrist… it’s up to you.</p>
<p>By the way, Azuro has plenty of bracelets to choose from, not just the classic black Obsidian one I have. Here are a few of my favorites:</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/egazuro"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16799" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final-Bracelets-Product-Image.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="526" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final-Bracelets-Product-Image.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final-Bracelets-Product-Image-300x123.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final-Bracelets-Product-Image-768x316.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/final-Bracelets-Product-Image-1024x421.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>

<h3>Look 3: Combining multiple bracelets</h3>
<p>I love mixing metals, textures, and textiles when I wear accessories. That means stone, metal, woven fabric, leather… all fair game.</p>
<p>Oftentimes my outfits are made up of all <a href="/tips-for-matching-colors-outfit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menswear neutral colors</a>, and wearing a few colorful accessories complements that nicely without being too over the top.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16778" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6401.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6401.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6401-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6401-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6401-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />
<p>When I have several bracelets on, I like to wear them on the wrist opposite my watch, but again, there’s no right or wrong way to do it. You can wear a few on the same wrist as your watch if you like that look.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t be afraid to mix metals as well. Both my necklaces are gold, but my watch is steel and my wedding ring is two-toned. My accessories are mixed and matched.</p>
<p>Again, there&#8217;s no right or wrong way to do it. But you do need a bit of confidence when mixing and matching, so if you&#8217;re even slightly unsure, keep it as simple as possible until you get more comfortable with the mix.</p>
<h2>Are you ready to accessorize?</h2>
<p>I hope this article inspires you to accessorize more! And more importantly, to do so in an intentional way.</p>
<p>You can use this thought process to build, develop, and evolve your personal style as well.</p>
<p>By being observant about how others dress and thinking about what you’re personally drawn to, you can begin to explore other pieces you might not have otherwise considered.</p>
<p>Thanks to our friends at Azuro Republic for partnering with us on this article! They have incredible bracelets that are <em>literally</em> crafted by hand, all with beautiful stones and precious metals, and a meaningful backstory behind each one.</p>

<h4>When you think about light wash denim, perhaps your mind drifts toward outlandishly faded high-rise jeans &#8212; think “Seinfeld.”</h4>
<p><strong>But the best men&#8217;s light wash denim couldn’t be farther from those retro styles.</strong></p>
<p>If you read Effortless Gent on the regular, you know how much we love to <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-dark-denim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommend and wear a pair of slim, dark denim</a>. It’s a tried-and-true essential that makes every guy look great &#8212; that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>And yet, as temperatures rise, we’re all about trading in your dark wash denim for a pair of the best men’s light wash denim &#8212; done the right way, of course.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite brands are putting serious time and effort into crafting slim-fitting, investment-level light wash denim that will only get better with age.</p>
<p>Don’t think you’re painting yourself into a corner by wearing light wash jeans &#8212; you can wear them the same way you’d wear your favorite pair of dark denim. Good pairings include <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-white-ocbd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford shirts</a> with suede chukkas, or a henley with <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-white-sneakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white leather sneakers</a>. Simple as that.</p>
<p>But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let’s talk about the denim that’s worth buying and wearing all season long.</p>
<h2>Benzak Denim Developers Slim 13oz. Denim</h2>
<a href="https://benzakdenimdevelopers.com/collections/jeans-pants/products/b-01-slim-13-oz-dark-stone?variant=17705977970803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16746 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Benzak-Denim-Developers-Jeans.jpg" alt="Benzak Denim Developers" width="600" height="900" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Benzak-Denim-Developers-Jeans.jpg 600w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Benzak-Denim-Developers-Jeans-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a>
<p>The thing with a pair of the best men’s light wash denim is that … well, it doesn’t have to be full-on light wash, 1980’s style-denim. This pair from <a href="https://benzakdenimdevelopers.com/collections/jeans-pants/products/b-01-slim-13-oz-dark-stone?variant=17705977970803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benzak Denim Developers</a> toes the line nicely, featuring exceptional Italian Candiani denim (one of the world’s best denim makers), plus an agreeable slim fit.</p>
<p>These are the perfect business casual jeans for spring and summer, yet the wash makes them casual enough to wear on the weekend with a crisp white tee and brown leather boots. <em>$55</em></p>
<p><a class="button small buy" href="https://benzakdenimdevelopers.com/collections/jeans-pants/products/b-01-slim-13-oz-dark-stone?variant=17705977970803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LEARN MORE »</strong></a></p>
<h2>Raleigh Denim Workshop Graham Pilot Denim</h2>

<p>If you don’t want to verge too far off the path of stylish indigo denim, a light wash option like the <a href="https://raleighdenimworkshop.com/collections/shop-mens-denim/products/graham-pilot?variant=2249052815370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pilot in Raleigh Denim’s Graham fit</a> is the way to go. These are an investment-level pair of light wash jeans you’ll have for years to come.</p>
<p>Even better, they feature 1% stretch for extra comfort and mobility. We’d wear these with a white Oxford shirt and tan suede chukkas any day of the week, in nearly any style situation. <em>$245</em></p>

<h2><strong>orSlow Slim Fit Denim Pants</strong></h2>
<a href="https://www.superdenim.com/us/107-slim-fit-2-year-wash-denim-pants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16748" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orSlow-Denim.jpg" alt="orSlow Denim" width="1200" height="1200" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orSlow-Denim.jpg 1200w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orSlow-Denim-150x150.jpg 150w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orSlow-Denim-300x300.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orSlow-Denim-768x768.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/orSlow-Denim-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<p>If you’re a guy who tends to favor the classic over the trendy &#8212; which you very well might be, seeing as that’s what we’re about at Effortless Gent &#8212; then these <a href="https://www.superdenim.com/us/107-slim-fit-2-year-wash-denim-pants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orSlow Denim Pants</a> are for you.</p>
<p>The light wash is, again, light without going over the top. And this pair is made from premium Japanese denim, in a slim fit &#8212; the “two-year” wash means they’re broken in to start, but you can still add plenty of your own character to them. <em>$287</em></p>

<h2>Todd Shelton Pro Soft Mid Denim</h2>

<p>As we’ve said before, not every pair of light wash denim has to veer into full-on “dad jeans” territory. Another fine example of this? The New Jersey-made <a href="https://toddshelton.com/jeans/pro-light-selvedge-medium-wash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Soft Mid Jeans</a> from Todd Shelton.</p>
<p>They’ve taken great care in crafting an investment-quality pair of denim that wears well with their essential, custom-made casual shirting &#8212; there’s no better spring and summer uniform, in our opinion. <em>$265</em></p>

<p>Is there a better option for a pair of the best men’s light wash denim than Levi’s? Not quite &#8212; perhaps with the exception of the rest of the picks on this list, that is.</p>

The 501 is utterly unimpeachable, and this update is even better. Wear these with white leather sneakers and a garment-dyed pocket tee for breezy spring and summer style. <em>$298</em></p>

<h4>You know those pieces we frequently mention here at Effortless Gent? The type of style staples you can wear day in and day out, season after season, without worrying about passing trends or fads?</h4>
<p><strong>Well, there&#8217;s a reason we do that &#8212; these are the sort of menswear essentials that stand the test of time. </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s with that spirit in mind that we&#8217;re introducing the <strong>EG Style Staples </strong>series &#8212; focused on the best of the best.</p>
<p>That means we&#8217;ll be spotlighting one product across different categories that you absolutely, truly, TOTALLY must have. That goes for seasonal must-haves (like tough outerwear for fall and winter) and pieces you can wear any time of year (like the perfect T-shirt or an essential chambray shirt).</p>
<p>The first entry? The fantastic <a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc">Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</a>, a pair of versatile five-pocket pants like nothing you currently own.</p>
<p>Why are these guys such an important piece to wear on the daily? Please, follow us right this way.</p>
<h2>Why You Need the Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re all about building an investment worthy <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/lean-wardrobe-minimalist-wardrobe-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Wardrobe</a> at EG. So we recommend gear that you can mix and match with ease. These are the sort of pieces that look and feel perfect whether you&#8217;re going for a relaxed look or a smart casual outfit.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc">Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</a> come into play, and it&#8217;s only part of what makes &#8217;em a style staple.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16726 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flint-and-Tinder-365-Pants-2.jpg" alt="Flint and Tinder 365 Pants" width="463" height="448" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flint-and-Tinder-365-Pants-2.jpg 463w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flint-and-Tinder-365-Pants-2-300x290.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px" /></a>
<p>As made and sold by the fine folks at <a href="http://effgnt.co/eghuckberry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huckberry</a> (a favorite online retailer that stocks menswear and lifestyle goodies that are made to last), the 365 Pants simply get the job done.</p>
<p>As the retailer says, they&#8217;re cut like your favorite pair of jeans &#8212; yet they wear like chinos (it&#8217;s that crucial blend of cotton and stretch fabric). For a go-anywhere pair of pants, that&#8217;s a pretty huge benefit.</p>
<p>And in a range of versatile colors, they&#8217;re the perfect candidate for a pair of pants to wear to work … then happy hour … and then out on the weekend. Go ahead, try telling us you don&#8217;t need a pair of pants like that.</p>
<h2>Standing Out from the Crowd</h2>
<p>OK, so the <a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc">Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</a> seem pretty cool. But, they&#8217;re just another pair of pants, right? Like your favorite chinos or jeans?</p>
<p>Not exactly. Cotton twill chinos can be a bit stiff. Inky indigo denim is very rigid at times. But <strong>these are cut to move with you &#8212; not against you</strong>. And it&#8217;s a critical difference that will earn them a place in your permanent menswear rotation.</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16727 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flint-and-Tinder-365-Pants-.jpg" alt="Flint and Tinder 365 Pants" width="501" height="435" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flint-and-Tinder-365-Pants-.jpg 501w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Flint-and-Tinder-365-Pants--300x260.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></a>
<p>They&#8217;re also quite soft. Take it from a guy who&#8217;s got three pairs in both Slim and Straight fits &#8212; the 97% cotton + 3% Lycra blend is key for all-day comfort.</p>
<p>This is a pair of pants you can wear for a full day of travel, and then head right out in when your plane touches down (I should know &#8212; I&#8217;ve done it). Try that in heavy denim or stiff chinos.</p>
<p>They also stand out from the crowd in another key area: they&#8217;re <strong>made in the States</strong>, something you&#8217;re not going to find for most pants in your wardrobe &#8212; especially not pants that run for under $100.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the fits. The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc">Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</a> come in both Slim and Straight cuts, yet neither are too extreme.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Straight Cut is a bit more relaxed, but it isn&#8217;t at all baggy.</li>
<li>The Slim Cut is nice and tailored without cutting off your circulation. Again, a tricky balance to strike.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming around now? Wait until you see how you can wear them.</p>
<h2>Styling and Personalizing the Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc">Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</a> have the potential to be the most versatile pair of pants you own (yes, even more versatile than a dark blue pair of slim denim). It all comes back to the &#8220;cut of a jean, feel of a chino&#8221; ethos.</p>
<p>These are more than suitable for the office. Trot them out with a white Oxford and <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-chukka-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tan suede chukkas</a> on casual Friday (menswear neutrals like navy, moss, earth, or charcoal will suit you well).</p>
<a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16728 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FT-365-Pants.jpg" alt="Flint and Tinder 365 Pants" width="666" height="500" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FT-365-Pants.jpg 666w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/FT-365-Pants-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></a>
<p><strong>Adding a blazer in the mix?</strong> Go for it &#8212; simply swap out your chukka boots for brown leather brogues.</p>
<p><strong>Dressing it down a little?</strong> The <a href="https://effgnt.co/2OUJZuc">Flint and Tinder 365 Pants</a> are your best friend. Pair them with white canvas sneakers and a grey slub tee, then throw on a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/five-ways-denim-jacket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denim jacket</a>. Or swap out the henley for a polo (we love the Flint and Tinder AirKnit Polos) and you&#8217;re good.</p>
<p><strong>Want to wear them when it gets a bit chilly?</strong> From a <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/the-perfect-fit-sweaters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rugged crewneck sweater</a> to a luxurious cashmere cardigan, the 365 Pants are imminently wearable.</p>
<p>And again, you&#8217;re getting them for under $100. So pick up a pair (or two, or three) and find out for yourself why they&#8217;re an Effortless Gent Essential.</p>

<h4>So, you&#8217;re a bigger guy, and you want to dress well, but you&#8217;re not sure where to start.</h4>
<p><strong>Maybe you can’t find clothes that fit right, or you just don’t know if something looks good or not.</strong></p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Well, I hear ya, and I know where you&#8217;re coming from.</p>
<p>I used to be a big guy myself—I&#8217;m 5&#8217;9&#8243; and 15 years ago, at my heaviest, I was 241 lbs and pushing a 40&#8243; waist (!)</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1123" title="me a long time ago" src="http://www.effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/fatme1.jpg" alt="B a long time ago" width="400" height="355" />
<p class="smallctr" style="text-align: center;">Me in my early 20s and 80 lbs heavier than I am today</p>
<p>Luckily (for you), I was always into fashion and my own personal style, so I picked up some tricks along the way that applied to both my bigger self as well as when I was losing weight.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking to dress sharp as a big guy, just follow these tips I&#8217;ve laid out for you in this article.</p>
<h2>Fashion Tips For Big Guys&#8230; in a video?</h2>
<p>Damn right!</p>

<h2>Big Guy Style Tip #1: Understand how clothes should fit YOUR body</h2>
<p>So, how exactly should clothes fit on a bigger guy?</p>
<p>You want to use the same fit cues that every guy should use. Your shirts and pants should fit close to your body without being too slim and tight, and also without being too big.</p>
<p>For example: With woven shirts (like collared dress shirts and sport shirts), first make sure the shoulder seam is sitting directly on top of your shoulder bone.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16689" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shirt-fit-1024x576.jpg" alt="big guys: how a shirt should fit" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shirt-fit-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shirt-fit-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shirt-fit-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p class="smallctr">Shirt and pants from <a href="https://fave.co/2HXmHDr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonobos</a></p>
<p>From there, how far away can you pull your shirt from your body? If you can pull it away 2-3&#8243;, that should give you enough room to move comfortably and sit down while still pulling off that slimmer, more tailored fit.</p>
<p>For pants to fit, they can be a bit closer to your legs, and you want to make sure there&#8217;s little to no break (meaning no excess fabric bunching and pooling at your shoes), and a slight taper from the knee down.</p>
<p>You want to avoid excess volume wherever possible, and having a tailored pant leg with little to no break makes you look slimmer.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16691" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pants-fit-1024x576.jpg" alt="Big Guys: How slim pants should fit" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pants-fit-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pants-fit-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pants-fit-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p class="smallctr"><a href="https://fave.co/2HXmHDr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bonobos</a> has plenty of choices for big guys</p>
<div class="panel callout">
<h5>MINI TIP: Sit down in the fitting room when trying on clothes.</h5>
<p>Shirts and pants may look good standing up, but when you sit down, it might be a completely different story.</p>
<p>Maybe the shirt is too tight and you can&#8217;t move your arms, or the buttons look like they&#8217;re gonna pop.</p>
<p>Maybe the pants are too tight in the thighs when you sit, or the waist is simply uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Clothing should be comfortable when seated, as well as when you&#8217;re up and walking around.</p>
</div>
<p>By the way, tailoring is everything!</p>
<p>Go to a tailor whenever necessary to achieve the best fit; most likely, clothes won&#8217;t fit you well off the rack, so this is the extra step you must take.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re not alone; pretty much everyone (aside from models whom most clothes are designed for) has to do this to achieve a tailored fit with off-the-rack clothing.</p>
<h2>Big Guy Style Tip #1B: Find cool brands that make your size, and stick with them</h2>
<p>If you watch other <a href="https://youtube.com/user/effortlessgenttv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">men&#8217;s style YouTube videos</a>, or simply look at models in magazines or in stores, you might think your clothes should / will fit like theirs.</p>
<p>Well, it won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to find the clothes and brands that work best for <em>your</em> body type.</p>
<p>Yes, that requires you to do a bit of leg work but once you find the brands and fits that work best, you can stick with that brand for life.</p>
<p><strong>Here are two great suggestions to get you started:</strong></p>
<h3>Bonobos: Smart, sharp casual fashion for big guys</h3>
<a href="https://fave.co/2HXmHDr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16698 size-large" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bonobos_screenshot-1024x576.jpg" alt="big guys: bonobos extended sizes" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bonobos_screenshot-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bonobos_screenshot-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bonobos_screenshot-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bonobos_screenshot.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>
<p>I love Bonobos for classic smart sharp looks, and it&#8217;s a brand I&#8217;ve shopped for years.</p>
<p>They recently introduced extended sizes, so basically, their same great clothes but made for bigger guys.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="button success large" href="https://fave.co/2HXmHDr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check Out Bonobos here »</a></p>
<div class="panel callout">
<h5>MINI TIP: Go shopping and try on clothing in the afternoon or evening instead of in the morning.</h5>
<p>You are your slimmest in the morning and your body expands and gets bigger throughout the day—you rehydrate, you eat meals, you move around, you sweat, etc.</p>
<p>If you shop and try on clothes early in the morning, what feels like a great fit then, may be uncomfortably snug by day&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>So, if possible, shop and try on clothes towards the end of the day.</p>

<h2>Big Guy Style Tip #2: Buy affordably (for now)</h2>
<p>Trust me, I&#8217;m all about buying investment-worthy pieces that look and feel great, that you enjoy wearing, that have great brand reputation and recognition, and are a pleasurable experience to own overall.</p>
<p>But!</p>
<p>Your body changes a lot as you lose weight, so assuming you <em>are</em> on that journey of dropping the pounds, it&#8217;s a good idea to buy affordably first.</p>
<a href="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/celeb2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16701 size-large" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/celeb2-1024x576.jpg" alt="fat to skinny celeb transformations zach galifianakis john goodman" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/celeb2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/celeb2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/celeb2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/celeb2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>
<p>Save the investment-worthy pieces for when you are at your ideal weight or body composition.</p>
<p>And once you hit your goal, treat yo&#8217;self! Grab those higher-quality <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/lean-wardrobe-minimalist-wardrobe-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Wardrobe</a> pieces, knowing that you won&#8217;t be having to replace them any time soon.</p>

<h3>Side Note: Follow big guys who dress sharp on Instagram</h3>
<p>Of course, Instagram can be a <em>huge</em> source of inspiration when you&#8217;re trying to figure out how to dress. Follow these stylish bigger guys on Instagram and pay attention to how clothes fit on them.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16702" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/instagram_bigguys.jpg" alt="great instagram accounts to follow for bigger guys - carpe_dmg ethandesu thefattorialist thebigsartorialist" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/instagram_bigguys.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/instagram_bigguys-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/instagram_bigguys-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/instagram_bigguys-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />

<h2>Big Guy Style Tip #3: Replace your most frequently worn items first!</h2>
<p>As you lose weight, your body shrinks, and you&#8217;ll need to replace some things.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re wearing clothes that are too big for you! And you won&#8217;t look like you lost weight at all.</p>
<p>You want to show off all your hard work, right?</p>
<p>So the big tip here is, as you lose weight, to replace the stuff you wear most frequently, <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>Wear a lot of jeans and flannel day to day? Grab new, smaller, affordable versions of those items.</p>
<p>Drowning in your suits? Time for another trip to the tailor!</p>
<p>A rule of thumb is, for every 10-15 (maybe 20) lbs you lose, you go down one shirt size. Of course, this depends on how big you actually are, but for most guys, this is a good estimation to keep in mind.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re down 25 lbs, there&#8217;s a good chance the clothes that fit decently a few months ago are <em>waaay</em> too big on you now.</p>
<p>So replace them!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll feel your best when your clothes fit right and you look sharp&#8230; even if you still have a ways to go in your weight loss journey.</p>

<h5>MINI TIP: Find pants with a bit of stretch!</h5>
<p>Looking sharp doesn&#8217;t have to mean being uncomfortable. Find pants with elastane or some other fabric with stretch property to get max comfort while out and about.</p>
<p>Luckily, many brands make pants with stretch properties in them.</p>
<p>My favorite pair of jeans for guys with bigger legs is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2YQILVF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Levi&#8217;s 541</a>. I even did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aIvAkKmiNc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a whole video on the 541</a>!</p>

</p>

<p>To clarify, I&#8217;m not telling you to replace <em>everything</em> in your closet just because you&#8217;re down a shirt size or two. I&#8217;m simply saying to replace the stuff that gets the most wear.</p>
<p>Replacing <em>these</em> items are what will make the most difference in your everyday confidence and look.</p>
<h2>Big Guy Style Tip #4: Set milestones and treat yo&#8217;self when you hit them</h2>
<p>This may sound a bit contradictory to tip #2 (buy affordably), but hear me out.</p>
<p>Going through the process of losing weight is an emotional experience. It takes a lot out of you! It&#8217;s a ton of hard work!</p>
<p>And because of this, I suggest setting little milestones for yourself, and once you hit those milestones, treat yourself to something nice.</p>
<p>It could simply be a pair of jeans or a button-up shirt that&#8217;s, say, double the price of what you&#8217;d normally buy. Or maybe a new pair of sneakers you&#8217;ve been eyeing.</p>
<p><strong>For example, I remember when I started my own weight loss journey way back in 2005</strong>, I wore a size 38&#8243; in pants and XL shirts.</p>
<p>In fact, the 38&#8243; waist started to feel a bit tight, so sometimes I had to size up to a 40&#8243; waist 😩</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not <em>that</em> tall (5&#8217;9&#8243;) so you can imagine how rotund I was.</p>
<p>So one day, it hit me, and I got really serious about losing weight. I was dropping, on average, 5 lbs every two weeks!</p>
<p>After 2.5 months, I was down 25 lbs and I noticed my jeans were way too loose on me, which made me go 😲 because it was surprising and I guess I hadn&#8217;t really paid attention until then.</p>
<p>I hit the mall and tried on some new jeans, and I fit in a size 34! <strong>You can bet I treated myself that day.</strong></p>
<p>They weren&#8217;t expensive jeans (I think I was at Express Men) but the fact that I was buying a size 34&#8243; was a treat in itself.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, set that goal, hit it, and then do something nice for yourself. You deserve it!</p>
<h2>Big Guy Style Tip #5: Keep sizing down until you can&#8217;t anymore, then start sizing up</h2>
<p>The fact of the matter is, most guys (big, small, short, tall) wear their clothes too big.</p>
<p>And as a big guy, the issue with that is multiplied ten-fold; big, loose clothing makes you look bigger! So you want to size down.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little trick to finding the right fit—combine this method with tip #1. Let&#8217;s say you normally wear an XXL and you <em>think</em> that&#8217;s your size.</p>
<ul>
<li>Next time you&#8217;re shopping, find a shirt (or pair of pants, or jacket) you like and take a M, L, XL, and XXL into the fitting room.</li>
<li>Start with the XXL, and work your way down.</li>
<li>Put each item on and keep sizing down until you literally cannot fasten the pants or button the shirt any more.</li>
<li>Maybe you manage to put on the medium shirt but your arms look like sausages and you can&#8217;t button it closed in the front. Great.</li>
<li>Then, start sizing up again one by one to achieve the best fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might end up at a Large, and that fits great. Perfect!</p>
<p>Or maybe it turns out that XL fits just fine, and you&#8217;ve been wearing shirts that are too big.</p>
<p><em>(Don&#8217;t forget to test the fit by sitting down in a chair!)</em></p>
<p><strong>You never would&#8217;ve figured this out if you didn&#8217;t try on multiple sizes of the same shirt!</strong></p>
<p>Remember that a well-fitting item of clothing won&#8217;t necessarily feel as comfortable as a big, billowy T-shirt or baggy sweatpants. That&#8217;s because clothes that fit well are closer to your body. You will feel them on your skin!</p>
<p>So always remember when trying on clothes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because you feel the cloth on your skin, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s too tight.</li>
<li>And just because it&#8217;s super comfortable—like your baggy sweats and oversized tees—doesn&#8217;t mean it fits well or makes you look good.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> <strong>Not all sizes are equal across brands.</strong> One brand&#8217;s Medium size is another brand&#8217;s Large. You have to go through this process with each new brand you try.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I always suggest when you find a brand or brands that work well for you, stick with them and buy all your clothes there.</p>
<h2>Big Guy Style Tip #6 (a bonus!): Thicker and heavier fabrics drape better</h2>
<p>Think oxford cloth shirts, twill dress shirts, flannels, etc. These shirts are made with a more substantial fabric and drape—or &#8220;lay&#8221;—better on your body.</p>
<p>Because of their weight, these shirts have structure and they make you look better because they aren&#8217;t hugging every luscious curve of yours.</p>
<a href="https://fave.co/2HYAxp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16706 size-full" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigguy_tshirts.jpg" alt="big guys: how a t shirt should fit!" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigguy_tshirts.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigguy_tshirts-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigguy_tshirts-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bigguy_tshirts-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p class="smallctr">If you&#8217;re wearing a tee by itself, it should fit like this. Perfect sleeve length, shoulder seam hits right where it&#8217;s supposed to, and there&#8217;s a bit more room in the torso so it&#8217;s not hugging every curve of your body</p>
<p>So if you wear a T-shirt under a knit sweater, it&#8217;s not as easy to hide the parts you&#8217;re looking to hide (and let&#8217;s be honest, when you&#8217;re overweight, you&#8217;re always trying to hide <em>something</em> or make it look a bit less conspicuous).</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s say you wear a heavier overshirt or &#8220;shacket&#8221; over a T-shirt, well, that will do a much better job at complementing your shape and hiding any body insecurities you don&#8217;t like.</p>

<p class="smallctr">This is a good example. The model is wearing a sport coat over a dress shirt. The sport coat has more structure and is designed to give you a waist, making you look slimmer.

<h4>You wouldn&#8217;t wear a fur-lined parka in the desert in the middle of summer, would you?</h4>
<p><strong>When it&#8217;s 90 degrees Fahrenheit outside, is the first thing you grab your heavy wool peacoat?</strong></p>
<p><em>(I hope not&#8230; weirdo)</em></p>
<p>We generally switch out our thicker, heavier clothes when spring shows up, and in again when autumn rolls back around. <strong>Why wouldn&#8217;t we do the same with our shoes?</strong></p>
<p>If this thought hadn&#8217;t yet occurred to you—and don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not something we talk about often—let me present to you my favorite men&#8217;s summer shoes&#8230; 5 warm weather-appropriate pairs that are worthy additions to your closet!</p>
<h2>Summer shoe #1: Espadrilles</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16625" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_espadrille.jpg" alt="Men's Summer Shoes: 5 Pairs Worth Considering for Spring and Summer - espadrilles" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_espadrille.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_espadrille-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_espadrille-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_espadrille-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;">Left to right: <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2UJnCKq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soludos</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2OfMlDC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea Star Beachwear</a></strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;re heading for the nearest body of water as often as you can, just like every other spring and summer.</p>
<p>Espadrilles are the perfect shoe for these getaways.</p>
<p>The most common style consists of a flexible sole—traditionally made from Esparto rope, though modern versions most likely are made from jute or other natural fiber—plus a cotton or canvas upper.</p>
<p>Because of how espadrilles look and are designed, they&#8217;re <strong>best worn in tropical, warm-weather places</strong>—you&#8217;re not wearing these in Chicago in the winter—or when you&#8217;re on the coast, at the beach, or at the pool.</p>
<p>Soludos is an easy go-to for good-looking espadrilles in a variety of uppers, from canvas to leather (the leather versions are more &#8220;around town&#8221; appropriate).</p>
<p>Sea Star Beachwear reimagined the espadrille while keeping its aesthetic largely the same, making their version with a neoprene upper and a deck shoe sole.</p>
<h2>Summer shoe #2: Knit sneakers</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16662 size-large" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_knit_2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Men's Summer Shoes: 5 Pairs Worth Considering for Spring and Summer - knit sneaker" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_knit_2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_knit_2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_knit_2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_knit_2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;">Left to right: <strong><a href="https://fave.co/2FowwX9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cole Haan trainer</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2Fp3WFh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nike Flyknit</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2TOkJM2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cole Haan tennis shoe</a></strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why a knit shoe is necessary for your summer wardrobe:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a great substitute for your go-to full leather sneakers</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll keep you cooler as the weather warms up</li>
<li>They&#8217;re super<strong> lightweight and flexible</strong></li>
<li>They&#8217;ll keep you comfortable even as your feet expand and shrink (totally happens as you move throughout your day!)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go with a classic tennis sneaker silhouette or a trainer with a more sporty look &#8211; you&#8217;re wearing these casually anyway.</p>

<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2TrTQs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penny Loafer and Double Monk from Ace Marks</a></strong></p>
<p>The tan leather loafer—specifically one with an apron toe—or a sharp double monk (or both!) are the best possible additions to your lean wardrobe.</p>
<p>Not only do they go with suits and more formal-leaning outfits, they easily dress up a smart sharp casual look. You can wear them with jeans, chinos, dress trousers&#8230; the options are endless.</p>
<p>I love this tan, cognac color in particular because it&#8217;s <strong>a bit more fun</strong> than your typical dark brown or black, and much more appropriate in the spring and summer as well.</p>
<p>They work with all your <a href="/clothing-color-combos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">menswear neutrals</a> and your lighter-colored summer outfits. My favorite combo is a pair of tan leather loafers with white denim and a navy linen shirt or sport coat. Super crisp and sharp!</p>
<p><em>This penny and double monk from Ace Marks are the perfect examples.</em></p>
<p>The penny has a supple full-grain calfskin leather upper that&#8217;s been hand dyed and burnished and a leather sole featuring Blake Flex construction&#8230; super flexible and comfortable. And yes, you can resole them.</p>
<p>The double monk is from Ace Marks&#8217; new Essentials line, with the same supple full-grain calfskin leather upper and a Blake-stitched rubber outsole.</p>

<p>By the way, thanks to Ace Marks for partnering with us on this article!</p>
<p>The brand is releasing two new lines, <a href="http://bit.ly/2TrTQs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signatures and Essentials</a>, and the Essentials line is <em>particularly</em> noteworthy.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the process of building out your Lean Wardrobe as we outline here on Effortless Gent, you&#8217;re gonna need a few pairs of dress shoes, and the Essentials line is right up your alley.</p>
<p>Every shoe in the Essentials line exists because they&#8217;re classics that belong in every man&#8217;s closet.</p>
<p>For the price, the quality is unmatched—you&#8217;re getting full-grain calfskin leather with flexible, Blake-stitched rubber outsoles (especially great when it&#8217;s slippery out) that can be resoled—all under $150!</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t already have at least one pair of Ace Marks shoes, you need to check them out. <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2TrTQs6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tap here to check out all the Ace Marks lines.</a></strong></p>
<h2>Summer shoe #4: Unlined Italian loafers</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16627" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_suedeunlinedloafer.jpg" alt="Men's Summer Shoes: 5 Pairs Worth Considering for Spring and Summer - unlined suede loafer" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_suedeunlinedloafer.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_suedeunlinedloafer-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_suedeunlinedloafer-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_suedeunlinedloafer-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;">Top to bottom, left to right: <strong><a href="https://fave.co/2HMw480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cole Haan</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2TVouzv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo Boss</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2HMdRHV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To Boot New York</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2unPzf8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meermin</a></strong></p>
<p>You may be wondering, <em>&#8220;Why would I need two different loafers?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The tan leather loafer from Ace Marks is perfect for the office, or worn with denim for dinner and drinks on the weekend.</p>
<p>This second loafer looks very similar, but is unlined, made from suede, and is <strong>much more casual yet still super sharp</strong>&#8230; think linen or light cotton pants, or even sharp tailored shorts with a linen shirt.</p>
<p>These loafers look perfectly at home on the coast, whether Miami or Positano, as well as in the city when the sun is beating down and you want to look sharp and put together&#8230; but they <em>feel</em> loose and laid back.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always easy to find the perfect lightweight, unlined, suede, apron toe loafer. The best I&#8217;ve seen recently is from Meermin (in the photo, first pair in the second row).</p>
<p>If you can get close—i.e. have most or some of these qualities: lightweight, unlined, suede, apron toe—then, good enough!</p>
<h2>Summer shoe #5: Suede chukkas</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16624" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_chukka.jpg" alt="Men's Summer Shoes: 5 Pairs Worth Considering for Spring and Summer - unlined suede chukka" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_chukka.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_chukka-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_chukka-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mensSummerShoes_chukka-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;">Top to bottom, left to right: <strong><a href="https://fave.co/2HMAwDK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clarks</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2TOmSY5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Varvatos</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2TRjZ8X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trask</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2uls1b1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gordon Rush</a></strong></p>
<p>The key word you want to remember for your summer clothes and shoes: Unlined.</p>
<p>Your sport coats should be unlined. Your loafers, unlined. And your chukkas too!</p>
<p>Chukka styles can vary, but the specific one I&#8217;m suggesting is lightweight, with an unlined suede upper and a crepe sole.</p>
<p>Leather uppers can work during the summer as well, just make sure the leather is soft and unstructured. So can leather soles (though they&#8217;re decidedly more dressy).</p>
<p>The best summer-friendly chukkas are lightweight, unlined, and unstructured.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll love these with lightweight denim or cotton chinos around town, and they&#8217;re <strong>the perfect spring and summer traveling shoe</strong> (easy to slip on and off at the airport security line).</p>

<p>The best men's spring jackets extend far beyond what you might think of at first - this ever-changing season isn't just about rain jackets.</p>

<h4>One day, it hits you. It&#8217;s not winter anymore &#8211; and your outerwear rotation isn&#8217;t quite up to snuff.</h4>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s where your handy team at Effortless Gent comes into play &#8211; because you deserve nothing less than the best men&#8217;s spring jackets across a range of different styles.</strong></p>
<p>The same principles we always preach here at EG still apply: Fit, quality, and versatility.</p>
<p>The best men&#8217;s spring jackets extend far beyond what you might think of at first &#8211; this ever-changing season isn&#8217;t just about rain jackets.</p>
<p>You can still have plenty of fun &#8212; yes, fun! &#8212; with the best spring outerwear for breezy days and (hopefully) warmer nights.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little bit like fall &#8211; there&#8217;s a lot you can wear, from a rugged denim trucker jacket to a lightweight cotton field jacket. And, of course, your tried-and-true rain jacket.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to run out to a fast-fashion retailer, either. We appreciate each of the brands on this list for the care and quality they&#8217;ve put into these garments. We know you&#8217;ll feel the same way.</p>
<h2>American Trench Coat in Dark Navy</h2>
<a href="https://americantrench.com/collections/all/products/american-trench-coat-in-dark-navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16650 size-large" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_americanTrench-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_americanTrench-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_americanTrench-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_americanTrench-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1_americanTrench.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>
<p>We promised you we&#8217;d move beyond spring rain jackets in this post &#8212; but not before we tell you all about the one spring rain jacket you really need.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not to love about <a href="https://americantrench.com/collections/all/products/american-trench-coat-in-dark-navy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this American Trench coat</a>? The Ventile cloth exterior is totally water-repellent, the silhouette is trim and easy to layer (even over a blazer and an Oxford shirt), and the crisp navy color goes with any combination you can dream up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a workhorse during the week and right through the weekend, so it&#8217;s worth the price you&#8217;re paying up front (we think, at least). <em>$849</em></p>

<h2>The Hill-Side J-1 Letterman Jacket</h2>
<a href="https://thehill-side.com/products/j-1-letterman-jacket-navy-black?variant=25459014280" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16651 size-large" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2_hillside-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2_hillside-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2_hillside-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2_hillside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2_hillside.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>
<p>There&#8217;s something simple yet remarkable about the letterman jacket silhouette &#8211; it&#8217;s certainly stood the test of time. And The Hill-Side has made maybe the coolest one out there, a jacket that transcends &#8220;high school jock&#8221; stereotypes to become so, so much more.</p>
<p>For weekend coffee outings or a night out at your favorite brewpub, <a href="https://thehill-side.com/products/j-1-letterman-jacket-navy-black?variant=25459014280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this letterman jacket</a> will wear quite nicely with faded indigo denim and a white slub tee. Think of it as the best men&#8217;s spring jacket for your off-duty uniform. <em>$595</em></p>

<h2>Falcon Garments MA-1 Bomber Jacket</h2>
<a href="https://falcongarmentsco.com/product/ma1-nylon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16652 size-large" src="http://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3_falcon-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3_falcon-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3_falcon-300x200.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3_falcon-768x512.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3_falcon.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>
<p>The bomber jacket has gone through fits and starts over the years, from its roots as a military-ready garment to its celeb-driven resurgence over the past half-decade. So, why start wearing one now?</p>
<p>In short: The MA-1 bomber jacket (especially <a href="https://falcongarmentsco.com/product/ma1-nylon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this handsome olive number</a> from Falcon Garments) is the definition of a grab-and-go spring jacket. It&#8217;s weather-ready yet not too bulky, it&#8217;s easy to layer, and it goes with most of your wardrobe already.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe us? Try it with a white slub henley and tan chinos the next time you want to look sharp &#8211; but not <em>too </em>dressed up. <em>$375</em></p>

<p>The best men&#8217;s spring jackets should be as versatile and functional as they are stylish. Bridge &amp; Burn has long been one of our favorite brands for this reason; it&#8217;s gotta be the brand&#8217;s Pacific Northwest roots.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bridgeandburn.com/collections/mens-jackets/products/nelson-cedarwood-mens-wax-coat?variant=16071000293410" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nelson Jacket</a> sits perfectly at that crossroads. It&#8217;s made with tough, water-repellent waxed canvas in a chore jacket silhouette, making this the ideal way to switch things up when you get tired of wearing your trusty blazer. <em>$258</em></p>

<p>We know we can count on Levi&#8221;s to deliver classic menswear with a modern twist. We feel the same way about the West Coast-based retailers at Unionmade, who are offering <a href="https://unionmadegoods.com/collections/jackets-outerwear-mens/products/trucker-in-danico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this classic jean jacket</a> for a solid price.</p>
<p>A light wash denim jacket is a spring go-to. It layers with ease over everything from a thermal henley to a white Oxford shirt, and it wears well with olive or tan chinos. Feeling edgy? Try it with black denim and tan suede chukka boots. <em>$98</em></p>

<h4>I&#8217;ve always said that guys should focus on building a Lean Wardrobe made up of <a href="https://effortlessgent.com/clothing-color-combos/">menswear neutrals</a>.</h4>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s because when you have a closet full of basics and essentials in neutral colors</strong>, it&#8217;s easy to put outfits together and you <em>know</em> you won&#8217;t mess up your clothing color combinations.</p>
<p>But what if you wanted to add<em> just a bit</em> of color to your outfits?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking orange pants or a bright pink shirt, but maybe a touch of orange or pink, <em>somewhere</em> in your outfit, so your look isn&#8217;t so&#8230; boring?</p>
<p><strong>Here are 5 areas you can add a pop of color to your outfit.</strong></p>
<p>Good news for you –</p>
<ul>
<li>they&#8217;re all relatively low-risk,</li>
<li>you can experiment without investing too much,</li>
<li>and you can do it quickly and easily!</li>
</ul>
<h2>5 Areas To Add A Pop Of Color</h2>
<h3>1. Your Socks</h3>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_socks.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16558" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_socks.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_socks.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_socks-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_socks-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_socks-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://fave.co/2Fd3Bq8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordstrom</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2u5GRlR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ted Baker</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2W0hxtk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calvin Klein</a></p>
<p>This is an obvious choice, and of course there are a plethora of options out nowadays, but I encourage you to do this with a healthy dose of subtlety.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to wear the loudest, most vibrant socks. Adding a pop of color is like enjoying a finger of scotch vs. chugging a 1/2 liter of beer. You&#8217;re going for a small dose of it, simple and effective.</p>
<p>So look for socks that are more understated&#8230; a color and pattern combination a true connoisseur or clotheshorse would appreciate.</p>
<h3>2. Your Belt</h3>
<a href="http://effgnt.co/ansonboxset" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16554" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_belts.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_belts.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_belts-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_belts-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_belts-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;">(<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_belts.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click to enlarge image</a>) Get Your <a href="http://effgnt.co/ansonboxset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anson Belt Box Set</a></p>
<p>If you ask me, Anson Belt is the obvious choice here.</p>
<p>You have plenty of options for strap colors and materials, the buckle and strap combos are completely customizable, the no-hole ratchet system allows for multiple sizing (adjustable to every 1/4&#8243;), which means you&#8217;re not stuck with only 5 sizes like a typical belt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wearing Anson for years and I&#8217;ve since replaced all my belts with theirs. (No joke, I have at least 5 in my rotation)</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried them before, they&#8217;re worth a shot. Anson&#8217;s also got 13,000+ 4- and 5-star reviews, so you can rest easy knowing you&#8217;re getting an awesome belt.</p>
<p>By the way, I suggest going the box set route. You get 3 belt straps and 2 buckles (or 2 belt straps and 3 buckles, though I&#8217;d choose the former) for under $100.</p>

<h3>3. Bracelets</h3>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_bracelets.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16555" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_bracelets.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_bracelets.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_bracelets-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_bracelets-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_bracelets-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://fave.co/2VZnPJN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half rope cuff</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2FdPDob" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuff</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2Fb9O5X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hook rope</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2VZO8zl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leather bracelet</a>, all from Miansai</p>
<p>I like buying accessories when I travel.</p>
<p>My latest purchase is a leather bracelet from Sayulita, a small beach town in Mexico, where I spent a week with good friends (and officiated my first wedding!).</p>
<p>Good memories, a great accessory, and I&#8217;m reminded of the fun times we had whenever I wear it.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t travel much, or simply want to accessorize NOW, I suggest checking out the bracelets from <a href="https://fave.co/2FkswIx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miansai</a>. Their bracelets feel elevated and polished, and they have a nice selection of unique styles. Above are a few of my faves!</p>
<h3>4. Your Shoes</h3>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_shoes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16557" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_shoes.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_shoes.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_shoes-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_shoes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_shoes-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://fave.co/2ubJ7ru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ace Marks blue loafers and green double monks</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2FcOOvM">Fratelli Rossetti Dusty pink tassel loafers</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2W28o3C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Belvedere color laces</a></p>
<p>This one might not be that obvious, but you can go for shoes from brands that offer unique leather colors and patinas.</p>
<p>Ace Marks is a good example of this. Fratelli Rossetti, a luxury shoe brand founded in the 1940s in Italy, also carries shoes with <a href="https://www.fratellirossetti.com/us-US-en/Fratelli-Rossetti-Art-518344207400473-Serie-13730-Tg-10_224374001.aspx">fun colors</a>.</p>
<p>And if you can&#8217;t commit to a colorful shoe, you can take a baby step by lacing your brown brogues with colorful laces. The ones you see above are from <a href="https://fave.co/2W28o3C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Belvedere</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Everyday Carry</h3>
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_edc.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16556" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_edc.jpg" alt="add a pop of color in your everyday carry" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_edc.jpg 1280w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_edc-300x169.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_edc-768x432.jpg 768w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/popofcolor_edc-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>
<p class="smalllink" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://amzn.to/2TF7FbO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moleskine Notebook</a>, <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/surfacepad-for-iphone?variant=18812762947641&amp;aff=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TwelveSouth iPhone case</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2VXVtQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carl Friedrik backpack</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2HyPNIq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bellroy Card Holder</a></p>
<p>Think of the things you carry with you every day. These, effectively, are a part of your whole look as well.</p>
<p>So experiment with colorful EDC items like your wallet, key fob, notebooks, bag, and more. And don&#8217;t feel like all your everyday carry items have to match; they <em>can,</em> but they don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to.</p>
<h2>The #1 Rule For Adding Pops Of Color</h2>
<p>Keep in mind the number one rule when it comes to incorporating pops of color into your outfits.</p>
<p>You want to make sure your base outfit is made up of <a href="/clothing-color-combos/">menswear neutrals</a>, and if you do that, adding little pops of color here and there is much easier, and you won&#8217;t have to worry about clashing or looking like the inside of a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=2560&amp;bih=1338&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=TZeJXNLmNaO1ggfksKqICw&amp;q=sanrio+store&amp;oq=sanrio+store&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l6j0i8i30l2j0i24l2.3112.3615..3798...0.0..0.76.403.6......1....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i67.ROc0X0SEIDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanrio store</a>.</p>

<h4>With clocks on every digital interface we encounter, wristwatches may seem pointless. But the best men&#8217;s watches are about more than just telling time.</h4>
<p><strong>Much like attention-getting socks or a cheeky monogram inside a suit jacket, the right wristwatch showcases the wearer&#8217;s personality in a unique way.</strong></p>
<p>A wristwatch is the one accessory that not only serves a specific purpose, but also stands the test of time. You won&#8217;t look at photos of yourself twenty years from now and say, &#8220;Oh man, how embarrassing, I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m wearing a watch in this photo!&#8221;</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re striving for classic and timeless when possible, you should know a little something about your options before you make a purchase.</p>
<p>So in this guide to the best men&#8217;s watches, you&#8217;ll learn the design and features that make our recommended timepieces stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p id="inpostnav">And since we&#8217;re all about dressing smart and sharp no matter the setting, we&#8217;ll show you:</p>
<ul>
<li>parts of a watch (so you know what you&#8217;re referring to and talking about)</li>
<li>the best watches for each type of outfit</li>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16469" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MG_3153_crop.jpg" alt="best men's watches - watch movement" width="853" height="830" srcset="https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MG_3153_crop.jpg 853w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MG_3153_crop-300x292.jpg 300w, https://effortlessgent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MG_3153_crop-768x747.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" />
<p>Watches with <strong>mechanical movements</strong> use a set of tiny, intricate gears to release the energy from a wound spring and calculate time based on that energy release. An easy way to spot a mechanical watch is the sweeping motion of the second hand.</p>
<p><strong>Manual mechanical watches</strong> require physical rewinding while <strong>automatic mechanical movements</strong> rewind themselves using the energy created by the wearer&#8217;s wrist motion throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Quartz watch movements</strong> use a battery to send an electric current through a small piece of quartz crystal. That produces vibrations which power the movement of the watch and measure time. You can spot a quartz movement watch easily by the jerky tick of the second hand.</p>
<p><strong>So which is the best watch movement for you?</strong> It all depends on your lifestyle and budget.</p>
<p>If you want a budget timepiece for everyday wear, go with a quartz movement. But for an investment-worthy dress watch you want to wear for decades, mechanical is the best watch movement.</p>
<h3>Watch Case</h3>
<p>A watch case is the main body that houses the movement. If it&#8217;s made from or mimics a precious metal (gold, silver, platinum, etc.), there&#8217;s a good chance your watch is more on the formal side.</p>
<p>If the watch case parts are made from steel, plastic, or other materials (ceramic, titanium, carbon fiber, etc.), it&#8217;s most likely not a formal watch.</p>
<h3>A quick note on watch case sizing</h3>
<p>Most men&#8217;s watch cases are 36mm-50mm in diameter.</p>
<p>Formal and luxury watch cases are typically on the smaller side (36-40mm). Sport-specific, fashion, and casual watches vary in size but are usually larger than formal watches.</p>
<p>Some fashion brands take it a bit too far and look like you&#8217;re wearing a wall clock on your wrist. Avoid these.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, the right watch size for you is relative. A 42mm watch may look too large on a 6.5&#8243; wrist, but perfect on an 8.25&#8243; wrist.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to measure your wrist and try on a few different watches.</p>

<h3>Watch Face and Dial</h3>
<p>Stick or Roman numeral indices tend to be found in more formal watches. Arabic numbers appear on more casual watches. Of course, there are exceptions to both.</p>
<p>Is the dial elegant and simple, or does it have multiple functions and complications?</p>
<p>The simpler and more elegant the watch parts, the more formal the watch. The more sport-specific task or feature rich (stopwatch, time zones, depth measurement), the more casual it is.</p>
<h3>Watch Strap</h3>
<p>The best watch straps vary from style to style. Here&#8217;s a simple way to identify which strap will look right with your attire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worn-in leather looks better dressed down with jeans than it does with a suit. Thicker, bulkier straps are better with casual outfits, as do nylon straps.</li>
<li>Glossy, slim, and thin leather bands best complement formal attire. They usually look out of place with denim and other casual clothes.</li>
<li>Metal bands can go either way. But if your watch is sport-specific (chronographs, divers, etc.) it&#8217;s meant for more casual wear, or that particular sport.</li>
<li>Rubber straps are decidedly sport-specific &#8211; save them for time when you&#8217;re active.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dress Watches</h3>
<div class="panel">
<h5>Best for</h5>
<p>Formal settings</p>
<h5>Characteristics</h5>
<ul>
<li>Slim, understated profile</li>
<li>Metal case</li>
<li>Simple watch face</li>
<li>Leather strap</li>
<li>Analog</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When attending a formal event &#8211; anything from a traditional wedding to a black tie event &#8211; a classic and understated men&#8217;s dress watch is best.</p>
<p>Your accessories should match the formality of the setting, so a simply styled watch with a light-colored face and black leather strap is perfect. (It goes without saying that your leather shoes and belt should also be black.)</p>
<p>For &#8220;dressy casual&#8221; or business casual situations when you&#8217;re still in a suit and / or tie, a similar watch with brown leather band would fit the bill.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s possible to get by with an all-purpose wristwatch in most instances, there&#8217;s something special about having one specifically for formal or special business occasions.</p>
<h3>Fashion Watches</h3>
<div class="panel">
<h5>Best for</h5>
<p>Casual, smart casual, and professional settings</p>
<h5>Characteristics</h5>
<ul>
<li>Larger case</li>
<li>Metal or leather bracelet</li>
<li>Activity specific features built-in to the watch face</li>
<li>Analog</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Metal fashion watches can be used in a variety of casual situations. They combine form and function in a way that speaks to your personal style.</p>
<p>Fashion watches aren&#8217;t right for formal settings, but they can work with just about any other situation. For example, I have a <a href="https://instagram.com/p/6sKE03oflC/?taken-by=effortlessgent">Gucci Pantheon steel watch</a>. It works just as well casually with jeans and a T-shirt as it does in a professional setting when I&#8217;m wearing a suit.</p>
<p>Want a fashion or sports watch that&#8217;s just as flexible? In that case, the best men&#8217;s watches for you will have understated designs and unadorned watch faces.</p>
<p>Activity-specific fashion watches have built-in features that are purpose driven. For example, diving watches are built to withstand underwater pressure. Pilot watches have large, easy-to-read numerals and dials.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to be a pilot, diver, or race car driver to enjoy watches that are specifically built and designed for these activities. It comes down to preference, so just make sure you&#8217;re wearing it in the right situations–in this case, not to a formal event.</p>
<h3>Sport Watches</h3>
<div class="panel">
<h5>Best for</h5>
<p>Active/Sports settings</p>
<h5>Characteristics</h5>
<ul>
<li>Large but lightweight</li>
<li>Rubber or nylon straps</li>
<li>Sport-specific features built in to the watch face</li>
<li>Digital or analog</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Sport watches are fun to have when you&#8217;re working out, playing sports, or being active. They&#8217;re lightweight, can take a beating, an are easy to clean up after a sweaty game or workout.</p>
<p>These watches have built-in features like timers (or chronographs if analog), water resistance (for diving and swimming), backlit screens or dials (for nighttime use), compasses, and altimeters.</p>
<p>Because of their strap material, large faces, and plethora of features, these watches are very activity specific. They&#8217;re best worn only when doing something active &#8211; they&#8217;re totally wrong for formal settings and can sometimes even be overkill for a casual outfit.</p>
<h3>Casual Watches</h3>
<div class="panel">
<h5>Best for</h5>
<p>Everyday wear, casual settings</p>
<h5>Characteristics</h5>
<ul>
<li>Smaller watch face</li>
<li>Metal casing</li>
<li>Nylon, leather, or metal strap</li>
<li>Affordable</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are the best men&#8217;s watches for when you&#8217;re not going anywhere in particular and you don&#8217;t need a special watch for the occasion. Think situations like low-key weekends, running errands, seeing a movie, etc.</p>
<p>Since these watches are daily wearers, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with choosing a more affordable option if restricted by budget. You can find stylish men&#8217;s casual watches with leather, nylon, or metal straps in a wide variety of sizes, colors, and designs.</p>
<h3>Smart Watches</h3>
<div class="panel">
<h5>Best for</h5>
<p>Everyday wear, sports/fitness, professional settings</p>
<h5>Characteristics</h5>
<ul>
<li>Large touchscreen face</li>
<li>Interchangeable straps</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Smartwatches represent the modern marriage of fashion and technology. For that reason, it&#8217;s hard to pin them down into one category or degree of formality. In most cases, you can fit a smartwatch into one of the above categories and style them similarly. Consider these three factors before you head out wearing a smartwatch:</p>
<p><strong>Design.</strong> A GPS running or fitness watch is activity specific and should be worn much like a sports watch. An Apple Watch with productivity apps you use while working will fit into both casual and professional settings.</p>
<p><strong>Strap.</strong> Sports-focused smartwatches often come with rubber straps, so wear them as you would any other sports watch. In the case of multi-use smartwatches with interchangeable straps (like the Apple Watch), make sure the strap you choose fits the setting. Rubber for sports, nylon for casual, and metal or leather for smart or business casual.</p>
<p><strong>Watch face.</strong> Fitness smartwatches typically have large digital displays that give them a casual look and feel that&#8217;s hard to dress up. Other smartwatches have optional displays, including analog-style faces. Those are best for smart casual and business settings.</p>
<h2>Best Men&#8217;s Dress Watches<br />
<span id="dress" class="smalllink label secondary"><a href="/best-mens-watches/#inpostnav">back to section menu</a></span></h2>
<p>Here are the factors we look for when choosing the best men&#8217;s dress watches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case: Relatively thin and made from steel or precious metal.</li>
<li>Strap: Leather or some type of exotic animal hide, sometimes metal.</li>
<li>Face/Dial: Simple stick or roman dial with light-colored, neutral, unadorned details.</li>
<li>Movement: Mechanical in luxury watches, quartz in less expensive options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Everyday Men&#8217;s Watches<br />
<span id="everyday" class="smalllink label secondary"><a href="/best-mens-watches/#inpostnav">back to section menu</a></span></h2>
<p>The perfect everyday watch is classically styled, not too sporty, and can still be worn with a blazer. At the same time, it can&#8217;t look so dressy that it feels out of place with denim.</p>
<p>Most of all, it can&#8217;t be so expensive or fragile that you&#8217;d be scared to scratch it up or break it. After all, you want to be able to wear this watch in just about any circumstances.</p>
<p>Your perfect everyday watch, much like your perfect Lean Wardrobe, will depend on your preferences, lifestyle, and budget. Here are a few that you may like, or at the very least, a few that will incite you to explore more and find one on your own.</p>

<h4>If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re probably having a hard time matching clothes. And don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re not alone.</h4>
<p><strong>In fact, it&#8217;s one of the most common questions I get! Usually, guys get confused when trying to combine different color shirts, pants, and shoes together.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this article, you&#8217;ll find easy-to-follow guidelines and tips so you&#8217;re never unsure how to match your clothes again.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do this!</p>
<h2 id="thebasicidea">How to Match Clothes: The Basic Idea</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m keeping this as simple as possible. Four things to keep in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>#menswearneutrals.</strong> Menswear neutrals are the KEY 🔑 to outfits that ALWAYS &#8220;match&#8221; and never clash. Learn these, memorize them, use them. Watch the video below to see what I mean.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast is key.</strong> Light top, dark bottom, light shoes. Dark top, light bottom, dark shoes. You want a good amount of contrast among the three.</li>
<li><strong>Stay away from tonal outfits</strong> (all three pieces being the same color, or close in value). It <em>can</em> be <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tonal_good.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled off successfully</a>, but also has the possibility of <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tonal_bad.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking kind of terrible</a>. It&#8217;s a more advanced style concept which we’ll cover in a different article.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid tops that are too close to your skin tone.</strong> It makes you appear pale and washed out. <a href="http://effortlessgent.com/contrast-clothing-combinations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read this article</a> for a more in-depth explanation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Matching Tips and Tricks in this Video</h2>
<p>In this vid I discuss a few matching tips and tricks that aren&#8217;t in this article. You&#8217;ll find more videos on EG&#8217;s YouTube channel, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=effortlessgenttv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>make sure to subscribe</strong></a>!</p>

<h2 id="afewthingstonote">Mixing and matching colors for clothes? Keep these things in mind</h2>
<p><strong>In the graphic below, you&#8217;ll see these are basic solids, and technically, all combinations can work.</strong> But, to make it easy when you&#8217;re starting out, focus on the top three choices I put together for you.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, you&#8217;ll no longer need this article and you&#8217;ll be able to figure out how to put together any color combination, not just the basics.</p>
<p><strong>We’re discussing color, not illustration accuracy or level of formality.</strong> This visual guide contains <em>symbols</em> representing tops, bottoms, and shoes. These are not necessarily representative of any specific type of shirt, pair of pants, or shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Use your imagination.</strong> If you can’t, and visualizing all this is too difficult for you, maybe you should consider my wardrobe building course, <a href="http://smartsharpstyle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Sharp Style</a>, where I help you put together a wardrobe from scratch, plus give you all the techniques you need to put together outfits quickly and easily.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment.</strong> Go to your closet, pull similar items, and put them together for yourself so you can see how they look together. It&#8217;s a lot easier than you think.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve started building these combos with the pants</strong>, but you can start with any item you want.</p>

<p><strong>There will be varying degrees of darkness and lightness in your clothing&#8217;s colors</strong>, so use your best judgement. You may be dealing with a darker neutral, or a shade of blue that is lighter than the representative symbol you see here. Just keep in mind that contrast is key.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s a mixed color shirt?</strong> Mixed color—anything from a basic <a href="http://effgnt.co/2znLiK2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contrast collar shirt</a> to <a href="http://effgnt.co/2znUPAU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tartan</a> or <a href="http://effgnt.co/2znLjO6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-colored gingham</a>—are best handled by asking yourself what the overall hue of the shirt is.</p>
<p>Hang your shirt against a blank white wall and walk to the other side of the room. Does its hue read blue? More red / pink? Neutral? Base the rest of your selections on how the shirt reads.</p>
<p><strong>Khaki chinos, gray trousers, and dark denim are safe bets</strong>, no matter the color of your shirt or shoes.</p>

<p>The whole idea is to show you how easy it is to pair shirts and pants, and how to finish off the outfit with shoes.</p>
<h3>Interpreting the guide to matching clothes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The top section shows the three clothing types, with every color I&#8217;m using in this example.</li>
<li>I started each outfit with the pants as the base.</li>
<li>Read the bottom section vertically to see the combos based on each pair of pants, B1 to B5.</li>
<li>The choices that don&#8217;t make the list could still work, though I&#8217;m trying to keep this simple.</li>
<li>Almost every shirt / pants / shoes combo within each group of three is interchangeable, so don&#8217;t feel stuck with these exact match-ups.</li>
<li>Remember: <em>1. experiment, 2. there are no hard-and-fast rules, 3. have fun.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you remember the three points from the beginning of this article (contrast, no tops too close to your skin tone, avoid tonal outfits), putting together combos from these basic colors is super easy.</p>
<p><strong>Why only basic colors?</strong> Simplicity, and also because if you&#8217;re following the <a href="/lean-wardrobe-minimalist-wardrobe-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lean Wardrobe</a> philosophy, you&#8217;ll have all these in your closet.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you&#8217;re adding mid- and top-level items based off the <a href="/lean-wardrobe-pyramid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lean Wardrobe pyramid</a>, you don&#8217;t have to worry about matching those things (because it&#8217;s all about <a href="/tips-for-matching-colors-outfit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complementing</a>, not matching).</p>
<h2 id="makessense">Make Sense?</h2>
