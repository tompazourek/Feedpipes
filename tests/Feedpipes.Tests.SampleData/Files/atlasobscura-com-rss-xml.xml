        <![CDATA[<p><img alt="Entries in the Punishment Book." data-width="4000" data-height="3000" width="300" height="200" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2EyN2NlNmJjLTBmN2QtNDA2Mi05ZTI1LTkyNGY3ODZjMjI2MTE3MjExYjUxZGVhMDEzN2RmOF9QdW5pc2htZW50IGJvb2ssIHBob3RvIERhdmlkIEhhbW1vbmQuSlBHIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjMwMHgyMDAjIl1d/Punishment%20book%2C%20photo%20David%20Hammond.JPG" /></p> <p>At the Jameson Irish whiskey distillery in Midleton, Ireland, archivist Carol Quinn shows visitors the “Punishment Book,” a listing of employee infractions (such as smoking) and associated penalties (usually withdrawal of the daily liquor ration). In times past, employees at Jameson’s Distillery were given a shot of whiskey when they came to work and a shot of whiskey before they left. Breaking company policies meant losing those morning and afternoon alcohol allotments.</p>
<p>“During the era of the Punishment Book," Quinn explains, “most adults smoked, and of course that was dangerous where you had so much raw whiskey maturing in oak barrels, all very flammable! Management had to be very vigilant about illicit smoking, though drinking on the job comes in a close second. But the most dangerous offense was stealing whiskey and removing it from the premises. In that instance, you aren’t just cheating the distillery, you’re cheating the Inland Revenue too, a much more serious thing, as they had the power to shut down operations if they thought whiskey was being removed without duty being paid. The main punishment was to stop your ‘grog,’ the two free glasses of Jameson each employee was entitled to every day, for a period of days or, in the worst case, a fortnight.”</p>
<p>In many ways, cutting off whiskey rations was a much kinder punishment than, say, docking an employee’s pay. “This is at a time when most women did not work outside the home,” Quinn explains. “The husband or father was the main breadwinner, and families depended on his wage. Cutting pay didn’t just affect the employee, it levied a punishment on the family. Stopping a person’s individual ration of free whiskey was a much more effective deterrent.”</p>
<p>The distribution of morning and afternoon slugs of product was also practiced at other distilleries and breweries. At the Guinness St. James Gate Brewery in Dublin, archivist Eibhlin Colgan notes that Guinness used to provide a glass of their brew during morning and afternoon breaks. Such liquid perks no doubt kept employees in tune with the fruits of their labor and perhaps further motivated them to cheerfully put in a good day’s work.</p>]]>

      <title>Lego Extremely Large Telescope in Garching bei München, Germany</title>

These telescopes are enormous by any metric, and allow people to see the universe at resolutions that are hard to imagine. However, astronomers are far from content at the moment, and are currently building the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will sport an opening of a staggering 128 feet (39 meters).</p>
<p>The ELT is the upcoming flagship telescope of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) that will be built in Chile. It’s expected to enable research that would now be much too difficult with the current telescopes. The ELT’s surface area will be roughly five times as large as the Very Large Telescope, and it can therefore capture the same amount of light in 1/22 of the time. Basically, if the current telescopes would need to integrate for two hours to get a good picture of a galaxy, the ELT could achieve the same in just over five minutes.</p>
<p>This next-generation telescope is still being built, and is estimated to be finished in 2025. In the meantime, the ESO has released a Lego model of the telescope for those who want to see how big it is. The model is built on a 1:150 scale. It consists of 5,274 pieces and is built in a way that allows for the same movement that the real telescope will have.</p>]]>

      <title>Fed Up With Fatbergs, an Australian Water Company Recorded a Jazzy Jingle About the Sewer</title>

        <![CDATA[<p><a class="destination-link article-destination-link" title="Things to do in Australia" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/australia" data-destination-link-kind="article" data-geo-id="4473" data-title="Australia" data-slug="australia">Australia</a>’s landscapes are famously full of wondrous creatures, and that includes the ones in South Australia: The long-snouted<a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/wildlife/numbat/"> numbat</a> noshes on termites in the <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/sanctuaries/yookamurra/">Yookamurra Sanctuary</a> and beyond. The <a href="https://www.bushheritage.org.au/species/malleefowl">chicken-sized malleefowl</a> <a href="https://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/malleefowl">mounds sand and leaves</a> into nests on the ground. And <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/mammals/greater-bilby/">the greater bilby</a>—which looks a bit like a bunny that happens to have a pointy snout and sharp claws—burrows. Bilbies don’t go deep—<a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/mammals/greater-bilby/">less than a foot</a> at a time—but they’re avid diggers. In fact, a single bilby can upturn some 20 tons of topsoil each year, <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/wildlife/bilby/">according to</a> the Australian Wildlife Conservancy.</p>
<p>Much deeper underground, there’s a whole other ecosystem—one engineered by humans and made of pipes. While you won’t find birds or marsupials moving through the sewer sludge, pipes in South Australia are home to an inanimate creation that looks a bit like a swamp monster—shaggy, gloopy, and meddlesome. Perhaps worst of all, it’s made from the stuff people flush down the drain.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67145/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/london-fatberg-museum-exhibition-conservation">London</a>, New York City, <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/whats-inside-fatbergs">and Charleston</a>, <a class="destination-link article-destination-link" title="Things to do in South Carolina" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/south-carolina" data-destination-link-kind="article" data-geo-id="4402" data-title="South Carolina" data-slug="south-carolina">South Carolina</a>, South Australia has got a fatberg problem. Made of grit and saponified fats clinging to a matrix of sticky solids (such as wet wipes and condoms), the hulking pipe-cloggers can snake through a city’s underground guts, impinging the flow of water and causing nasty backups of sewage.</p>
<p>Combating fatbergs requires a range of approaches and artillery, from blasting the behemoths with water (to break them down into a slurry) to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/sidmouth-devon-england-fatberg">hacking at them with pick-axes</a> (to break them into manageable bits).</p>
<p>But defeating the clogs is an expensive and time-consuming business, so prevention plays a big role too—and water utilities around the world have recently launched campaigns urging residents to pause before they pour cooking oil (or, for that matter, <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/yorkshire-pudding-sewer-blockage">entire Yorkshire puddings</a>) down the train. In February, New York rolled out <a href="https://gothamist.com/2019/02/15/nyc_fatberg_fearberg.php">a series of comic book–style public-service announcements</a>. In July, the South Australian utility SA Water released a jazzy jingle.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-20147988/sa-water-jingle-the-three-ps">17-second earworm</a> has a simple backbone—a folksy guitar and a singsong voice reminding listeners that nothing belongs in the toilet except for the “three Ps”—“paper, pee, and poo.” (New York’s ad campaign adds a fourth “p” to the mix—"puke.")</p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/654987356&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“Everything else—the wet wipes, the nappies, the tampons, the pads—[doesn’t] break down,” SA Water innovation manager Anna Jackson <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-23/paper-pee-and-poo-jingle-to-target-fatberg-waste/11337272">told ABC Radio Adelaide</a>. The cheerful jingle instructs listeners to think before they flush: “If it ain’t the three Ps,” the ditty goes, “pop it in the bin, please.”</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67147/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Compared to, say, the monsters that have sprawled beneath English streets—a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/london-fatberg-museum-exhibition-conservation">particularly gnarly one</a> in London spanned more than 820 feet and weighed more than 130 tons—South Australia’s fatbergs <a href="https://twitter.com/SAWaterCorp/status/1156012799685849089?s=20">are downright petite</a>. But the cost to extract them is still hefty—$400,000 a year, according to SA Water.</p>
<p>Australia's South West region is also fighting fatbergs. There, <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/south-western-times/clearing-fatbergs-a-costly-exercise-ng-b881276704z"><em>The</em> <em>West Australian</em> reported</a>, it can cost as much as $50,000 to unclog a blockage at a single pump station.</p>
<p>Meaning the best kind of fatberg is one that never exists in the first place.</p>]]>

      <title>S.S. City of Milwaukee in Manistee, Michigan</title>

It's a relic of the days when numerous ferries carried rail cars, automobiles, and passengers across the lakes.</p>
<p>Launched on November 25, 1930, the S.S. <em>City of Milwaukee</em> ferried railroad cars across Lake <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in Michigan" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/michigan" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="4423" data-title="Michigan" data-slug="michigan">Michigan</a> for more than 50 years. The 354-foot-long boat operated under the flag of the Grand Truck Railroad for approximately 47 years before being acquired by the Ann Arbor Railroad for the last four years of its formal service. </p>
<p>The ferry could carry between 28 and 30 loaded railroad cars across the lake, generally on either the Muskegon, Michigan, to <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in Milwaukee, Wisconsin" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/milwaukee-wisconsin" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="1314" data-title="Milwaukee, Wisconsin" data-slug="milwaukee-wisconsin">Milwaukee</a>, <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in Wisconsin" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/wisconsin" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="4426" data-title="Wisconsin" data-slug="wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, route or between Frankfort and Elberta, Michigan, and Kewaunee and <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in Manitowoc, Wisconsin" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/manitowoc-wisconsin" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="7763" data-title="Manitowoc, Wisconsin" data-slug="manitowoc-wisconsin">Manitowoc</a>, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>For many years after its service was discontinued, the ferry sat anchored in Elbert, Michigan, before it was acquired and moved to Manistee. It was then restored and repurposed as a museum and a bed and breakfast. The S.S. <em>City of Milwaukee</em> is listed as a National Historic Landmark.</p>]]>

The cluster of domed structures and has been classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. </p>
<p>More than 500 of these tombs sit at the foot of Jebel Hafeet mountain. They look like small stone igloos baking in the Sun.</p>
<p>Incredibly, some of the tombs still contain skeletal remains. These tombs and architectural remains are significant, as they are a rare and unique illustration of human development in the Bronze Age and the Iron Age on the Arabian Peninsula. </p>
<p>The drive alone to get to the tombs is an adventure in itself. Although Jebel Hafeet mountain is accessible on the <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in United Arab Emirates" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/united-arab-emirates" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="4563" data-title="United Arab Emirates" data-slug="united-arab-emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> side via an excellently maintained road, the tombs are off-road.</p>]]>

But the botanic garden is also home to something a bit more surprising. Bennett's wallabies have roamed there since the eccentric naturalist Sir Edumind Loder introduced them in the late 1880s.</p>
<p>The species is native to the Australian island of Tasmania, where it often experiences harsh weather conditions and temperatures. As such, the wallabies have evolved thick and dense winter coats that have allowed the species to thrive in the <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in United Kingdom" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/united-kingdom" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="4441" data-title="United Kingdom" data-slug="united-kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in Ireland" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/ireland" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="4523" data-title="Ireland" data-slug="ireland">Ireland</a> after they were introduced by the Victorians. </p>
<p>Today, more than 100 wallabies, some of which are albinos, roam the Australian garden at Leonardslee. They're particularly entertaining to watch in the spring when mothers rear their young in their pouches, and summer when males perform boxing-style bouts with one another to compete for mates. </p>
<p>Wallabies aren't the only animals you'll see at the gardens. The grounds also house three species of deer: the Japanese sika, the Indian Chital, and the native fallow deer. </p>]]>

<p>The flak position in Tantolunden park was built to defend the bridges Årstabron and Liljeholmsbron in case of an aerial raid. Unlike many other similar positions built at the time, this one was not constructed as a tower. Instead, a number of foundations were built on which the cannons could be placed. The main armament consisted of two 40-mm anti-aircraft flak cannons served by seven soldiers, and apart from them there were another 40 soldiers to defend the position.</p>

Andreas Gugumuck, a former IT specialist and boxer, has fast turned his snail farm in the south of Vienna into a hub for sustainable farming. </p>
<p>The farm raises Wiener <em>schnecke</em>, or "Viennese snails." Visitors can tour the farm, participate in "snail rearing" workshops, and enjoy the fruits of Gugumuck's labors at the shop or bistro. The former includes jarred snails as well as snail livers and caviar. The bistro serves specialized snail dinners three Fridays each month (it seats only 28, so reservations are recommended). The snail farmer himself is usually around to guide guests through the various courses.</p>
<p>Back in the 18th century, snails were a popular food in Vienna, which ran its own snail market just behind St. Peter's church. Now they form not only a part of Austria's culinary heritage, but may hold a promising place in its future: To firmly position snails as a resource-saving alternative to meat, Gugumuck collaborates with agricultural and food scientists and speaks at sustainable food events. </p>]]>

The statue was a collaboration with Joan Gardy Artigas, who applied its colorful tiles. It's one of three pieces commissioned by the city of <a class="destination-link place-destination-link" title="Things to do in Barcelona, Spain" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/barcelona-spain" data-destination-link-kind="place" data-geo-id="6760" data-title="Barcelona, Spain" data-slug="barcelona-spain">Barcelona</a> to welcome visitors. </p>
<p>"Dona i Ocell" ("Woman and Bird") continues Miro’s theme of using women and birds. Its name has an additional meaning, too, as <em>ocell </em>is also a slang term for penis, and the statue has a rather phallic shape. There's also a yonic gap down the side of the statue, which is outlined with dark tiles.</p>
<p>Joan Miró Park stretches across four city blocks, though it's divided in to separate spaces. One area has many different trees including eucalyptus, pine, and palm trees. Another is paved and contains the artificial lake, with the sculpture towering in a corner. The park is also known as <em>Parc de l'Escorxador</em>, which translates as Slaughterhouse Park, as a slaughterhouse once occupied the area.  The park opened months before Joan Miró's death, though he was too ill to attend the sculpture's dedication. </p>]]>

After letting friends hang around for nearly a decade, he formalized his hospitality and converted his home into a café. He applied for a liquor license shortly thereafter (his patrons were already practicing the BYOB model), and, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VeniceCafeStl/?ref=ts">according to the bar's Facebook</a>, "then took on the business model it follows today: Booze and beauty for cash."</p>
<p>The beauty that Venice Café alludes to—concentrated, vivid, and frenetic—swarms the property, both inside and out. The patio is filled with cement statues covered in tiles<strong>,</strong> and a collection of artwork created by Lockheed himself is visible through the window. Inside, mosaics and quirky assemblages blanket every visible surface. Venice achieves the kind of glow patrons expect from a barroom by blending the soft emanations of more than 20 different light fixtures in yellow, red, green, and blue. These collections are the result of decades of collection and curation, and Lockheed welcomes donations. Simply drop your gift off by the alley door and it will either be added to the gallery or disposed of.</p>
<p>Downstairs, you'll find an ATM (the bar is cash-only), along with a fish tank, turtles, and a continued expanse of mosaics that flows into two bathrooms and surrounds the toilets. To find them, just follow the stairs beneath the neon sign that reads "Shitters." </p>
<p>The Explorer’s Lounge, which occupies the upstairs level, opens on Friday and Saturday nights. Mr. Waylon Slithers—a king snake known for napping in a vacant turtle shell—greets guests from his tank behind the bar. Taxidermy and artwork dot the room. Attached to the lounge is a bathroom that goes by The Blue Hole and is filled with curios, from ceramic lions to ancient chests to monkey statues that hold toilet paper to more mosaics.</p>
<p>Outside, the walls are covered in ashtrays, lighters, action figures, and more bric-a-brac. During the city's warmer months, "The Garden" opens up, complete with spring foliage. There's also a functioning "boat bar"—made from the front end of a boat. Patrons saddle up to the outside while a bartender mixes cocktails from behind the steering wheel. For those who don't like liquor, the bar also serves up beer and wine.</p>
<p>Two resident turtles, Myrtle and Shemmy, occupy the adjacent pond. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VeniceCafeStl/?ref=ts">On Lockheed's request</a>, "Please don’t throw pennies in the pond. You’ll hurt the shell babies and your dumb wish will never come true."</p>]]>

The street is completely full of shops dedicated to the traditional Neapolitan presepio, the Christian nativity scene. Almost every figure and decoration found here is handmade by local nativity scene artisans.</p>
<p>The tradition of the presepio (also spelled presepe) goes back to the Middle Ages, when Saint Francis of Assisi created the first nativity scene in 1223, depicting the infant Jesus in a manger. But it wasn't until the 16th century that it started to become common in Naples to put nativity scenes in churches and houses before Christmas. During the 17th and 18th centuries the nativity scene became more widespread and began incorporating fine handcrafted figurines. Many presepi from this era that are true works of art can be seen in churches and palaces in Naples and the surrounding region.</p>
<p>Now, besides the classical figures of the presepio—the baby Jesus, Mary, and Joseph—all kinds of statuettes can be found on Presepi Street, from pizza makers to animals, and especially caricatures of celebrities like politicians, singers, TV personalities, and athletes (mostly soccer players), in a fusion of sacred and profane. The figures are often small enough to place in a nativity scene, but sometimes even life-size statues can be found. Also on offer are various decorations and structures crafted for nativity scenes, from little household objects to full houses, as well as trees, mountains, and evens rivers and waterfalls with real water.</p>
<p>Many characters or places have hidden meanings rooted in the long tradition of the presepio. Different merchants represent different months of the year, and the river represents the mythical river Acheron that marked the border of Hell. Statues of the classical masked character of Pulcinella that has represented Neapolitan people since the 16th century are also very common, along with other symbols of the local culture, such as the little horn amulet worn to protect against bad luck.</p>]]>

Originally, the Tabacal neighborhood of Xicotepec de Juárez<em>, </em>also known as Villa Juárez<em>, </em>was home to a small church consecrated to the Virgin of Guadalupe.</p>
<p>In the late 2000s, however, a government and civic proposal lead to the conversion of this sleepy neighborhood into a religious tourism destination. Mexico's "<em>Pueblos Mágicos"</em> <em>(</em>Magical Villages) program started in 2001 as a way to allocate federal funds to towns with touristic potential that could use a boost.</p>
<p>Construction on this 75-foot (23-meter) statue started in 2009 with money obtained through grassroots funding projects. It was inaugurated in 2011 after injections of funds by local and state governments. By 2012 it, along, with the town's historical heritage<em>, </em>lush landscapes, and local gastronomy had helped Xicotepec become a "Magical Village."</p>
<p>In the following years, the statue's fame grew, and it started becoming an important pilgrimage site. The federal funding program ended in 2018, although by this point Xicotepec had become a religious tourism destination. That same year, a huge cross was built farther up the mountain from the Virgin, along with steps connecting the two, thus creating one of the world's most recent Catholic pilgrimage sites.</p>]]>

The path leads to an abandoned brick and tile factory, known as La Ceramica, that during its heyday in the 1940s and '50s helped rebuild wartorn Sardinia.</p>
<p>The site consists of two main buildings, the factory and an office, that were shuttered in the 1980s and left forgotten. Piles of red bricks are strewn all around, left behind when the factory was abandoned. Some of them have been smashed and become crimson sand glittering in the sunset, while the light casts long shadows from the broken doors and windows.</p>
<p>Delicate spiral stairs lead to the upper level, which has a firing kiln in the middle and thousands of tiles piled into rows. There are parts of beautiful brick ornaments still on the walls. On the ground level, there are two massive firing tunnels and a tall, empty hall where rainwater-filled pools on the floor reflect the open interior.</p>
<p>In the office building, the shower room is completely demolished and the windows of the offices are sealed with bricks, of course. The walls are covered in graffiti from the past decades: "bum bum bum," "Pink Floyd," "Marco and Maria 8/8/1986." Peacefully buzzing bees have taken over the empty rooms. The sounds of nature are intense, as grasshoppers, insects, and birds are now the only sounds in this empty factory surrounded by fields and forests</p>]]>

      <title>These Hidden Treasures Hold Clues About Jewish Life in Medieval France</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>In 1863, a mysterious terracotta pot was discovered in the wall of a French sweet shop. Handymen stumbled upon it while renovating the building in Colmar, a commune in the riparian region of Alsace. Upon closer inspection, this proved to be no ordinary piece of pottery. The pot held a collection of medieval treasures: <a href="https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/hidden-colmar-treasure-comes-to-met-cloisters-1610554">384 silver coins</a> and 14 gold and gem-encrusted rings, to be exact.</p>
<p>Now these precious items, which date to around the year 1300, are on display at The Met Cloisters in New York City, on loan from Paris’s Musée de Cluny. One artifact in particular—a ceremonial wedding ring—is giving art historians insight into who owned the treasure chest and why it was concealed.</p>
<p>Made of gold and decorated with colored enamel, the wedding ring is the most ornate and skillfully constructed piece in the collection. When it was discovered in the 19th century, after having been hidden for 500 years, it was still in good condition.</p>
<p>“Even when buried, gold retains its luster—unlike silver or copper, for example,” says Barbara Drake Boehm, curator of the exhibition<strong>.</strong> However, “it has lost its green translucent enamel, which [was paired]with the red enamel that remains.”</p>
<p>A clue found in the goldsmith’s handiwork reveals that this ring was made specifically to celebrate a Jewish union. Its centerpiece is a structure that looks similar to the lost temple of Jerusalem, and it features Hebrew letters that spell out “Mazel Tov,” or “Congratulations.”</p>
<p><strong>“</strong>Fourteenth-century Jews in Colmar were citizens of the Holy Roman Empire,” says Boehm, “and until the Black Death broke out, theirs was a thriving community. The treasure was found on the ‘Rue des juifs,’ or ‘Street of the Jews'—an area where Jews and Christians had lived alongside one another for close to a century.”</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67143/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>At the time, Colmar’s Jewish and Christian populations not only lived in harmony; they also shared the same class status and held similar tastes. Boehm says that jewelry similar to the pieces found in this Jewish family’s treasure chest is described in the wills of Christian families too.</p>
<p>“Judging from the size and contents, I believe the treasure belonged to one Jewish family of the merchant class,” says Boehm. “There’s the tiniest whisper as to who the owner was [hidden in the ring]: A belt in the treasure bears a small inscription that reads ‘ANCH,’ which might be the medieval equivalent of ‘Annie.’ So maybe this is ‘Annie’s’ family’s treasure.”</p>
<p>The bubonic plague devastated Europe in the middle of the 14th century, and more than half of the Holy Roman Empire’s Jewish population died between <a href="https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/hidden-colmar-treasure-comes-to-met-cloisters-1610554">1348 and 1351</a>. Colmar’s Jewish community’s synagogue, mikveh (ritual bath), and school were demolished.</p>
<p>“It had long been thought that the treasure was the only legacy of the medieval Jewish community of Colmar,” says Boehm. The family in possession of these coins and jewels may have hidden the pot in a wall as racial tensions rose with the onset of the pandemic. Or simply because that was the wisest place to sequester family valuables.</p>
<p>Recently, Judith Kogel of the <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/en/cnrs">French National Centre for Scientific Research</a> in Paris has begun reconstructing the library that belonged to the Jews of Colmar, after discovering illustrated Hebrew manuscripts and prayer books in the region. Centuries after they were written, these pieces of literature—now coupled with one medieval family’s personal jewels—are finally starting to tell the story of Colmar’s Jewish community and its long-obscured history.</p>]]>

      <title>Embracing the Mysteries of a Trove of Hungarian Photos, Rescued From the Dustbin of History </title>

        <![CDATA[<p>The woman with the fashionably-angled hat looks wary and weary, as she sits next to a decorated soldier, preoccupied, it seems, with his hands and thoughts. His beer is almost empty; she doesn’t seem to have one, or has she pushed that fuller glass aside? Are they preparing to dine in the tent? What is the occasion?</p>
<p>Many of the photos in the exhibit <a href="https://en.mng.hu/exhibitions/every-past-is-my-past/"><em>Every Past Is My Past</em></a> carry a similar air of mystery. Curated from Hungarian online archive <a href="http://www.fortepan.hu/">Fortepan</a>, this collection started with images found in the trash in the late 1980s, by Fortepan founders Miklós Tamási and Ákos Szepessy. Many of the pictures, which have since been augmented by many more from other sources, have no captions or identifying information—no explanations. These are moments of everyday life from throughout the 20th century, frozen in time and often open to interpretation. We’ll never know what the woman in the hat is waiting for.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67094/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Every spring in Budapest there is a tradition called <em>lomtalanítás</em>, in which everyone throws their garbage out on the street, creating a hellish trashscape for sanitation workers and a playground for dumpster divers. “Walking through Budapest at the height of <em>lomtalanítás</em> days is an experience akin to setting out into a post-apocalyptic city where no apocalypse has occurred,” writes Nick Robertson in an article on <a href="https://welovebudapest.com/en/2015/04/07/of-trash-and-treasure-lomtalanitas-reveals-many-budapest-lives/"><em>We Love Budapest</em></a>, “... sidewalks are buried under meters-high mounds of myriad junk, forcing pedestrians to wander down the middle of the road in a muddled haze.”</p>
<p>For decades, these “junk clearance days” declared by city officials have allowed people to chuck anything they don’t want, from a year’s worth of newspapers, to yesteryear’s furniture, to appliances that haven’t worked for years—without limit or cost. People place their items out well before the appointed date, when trucks come through and clear everything out. The period leading up to this are a bonanza for scavengers, scrap metal collectors, artists, and other enthusiasts of the discarded, such as the founders of Fortepan (which is named for a discontinued brand of Hungarian photographic film).</p>
<p>The rescued snapshots offer glimpses of ordinary moments, across a wide range of Hungarian life. One image shows four uniformly dressed young women from 1904 in a lush garden, leaning in and touching heads. Another depicts the festive solidarity of Hungarians attending a parade to celebrate their version of Labor Day, May 1, in 1957, complete with balloons and streamers. A more sobering scene shows us the cool gaze of a Soviet soldier in a wrecked Budapest during the last year of World War II.</p>

<p>First launched online in 2010 with 5,000 found images from lomtalanítás and rummage sales, Fortepan now contains more than 115,000 photographs, thanks in part to a continuous stream of donations from individuals and institutions. According to Fortepan’s editor and manager András Török, the message of the photos is resilience, how the “private drive to live a happy, full life was hindered, but not blocked, by the terrible 20th-century Hungarian history.”</p>
<p>Besides providing a wealth of fascinating stories and curious little mysteries for browsing, the archive is community-based, which is atypical of such historic collections. Registered viewers can tag and add keywords to images for all to see, or chat in forums about attempts to identify locations in the pictures. Hungarians have written letters to Fortepan expressing surprise at seeing a friend, relative, or even themselves in an old photograph. Fortepan also offers all of their materials to download and use for free. Fortepan is so popular that a sister website, <a href="http://www.fortepan.us/">focusing specifically on Iowa</a>, launched in 2015. Török hopes that “archives, all over the world will sooner or later adopt our approach.”<br /><br /><a href="https://en.mng.hu/exhibitions/every-past-is-my-past/"><em>Every Past Is My Past</em></a> is on exhibit at the Hungarian National Gallery through August 25, 2019. <em>Atlas Obscura</em> has a selection of images from the archive.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Sixteenth-century Japan had a wardrobe problem. Citizens of every class all wore kimonos, T-shaped robes wrapped around the body and held in place with sashes called obis. Kimonos are functional and elegant but lack a crucial element rather helpful for everyday life: pockets. People have always needed to carry things, and medieval Japan was no exception. The practical solution to this sartorial problem evolved into <em>netsuke</em>, one of the most distinctive and diminutive art forms in a country known for them.</p>
<p>Netsuke were, from their creation, a gentleman’s game. Japanese women made do by tucking small objects into their baggy, sewn-up sleeves, creating a kind of makeshift purse, Hollis Goodall, a Japanese art curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, told <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/Netsuke-Collecting-Guide-5-Things-to-Know-7963-1.aspx"><em>Christie's</em></a>. But men had no such luck, with their open, unsewn sleeves. To carry small objects such as tobacco or medicine, they crafted <em>sagemono</em>—generally, “hanging things”—that were suspended on a cord from an obi. They functioned like detachable external pockets or tiny purses, and to keep them in place, men fastened small carved ornaments, netsuke, to the loose end of the cord. The totems acted as counterweights that helped cradle the pockets between the wearer’s waist and hip. “It’s like a fob or a toggle, a giant button,” says Robert Mintz, deputy director of the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and a scholar of Japanese art. “You pop the giant button under your belt and it keeps your suspended object from falling.”</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67131/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>The first netsuke were observed during the 16th century, in Japan’s Muromachi Period, and were simple, natural paperweights, frequently a chunk of wood or a dried gourd, Japanese netsuke expert Barba Teri Okada wrote in a 1980 issue of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3258709.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fdefault-2%2Fcontrol&amp;refreqid=search%3Ab47c77923a9a0d537b157df3c23ef8a7&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"><em>The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin</em></a>. After all, any small object could work. The only requirement was that the item must have a place to thread a cord and be smooth all over to avoid snagging on the delicate silk of a kimono. But the artistic possibilities of the ornaments were endless, and Japan’s evolving social structures led artists to transform these mundane objects with an entirely new class of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>The first to wear netsuke were warriors, or at least men from the warrior class. When shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu ascended to power in 1603, he instituted stringent neo-Confucian code that stratified society into four distinct classes, Okada writes. Warriors were at the top, followed by farmers, artisans, and finally lowly merchants. The shogun established laws to govern seemingly every aspect of daily life, including sumptuary laws to dictate how people were to dress, Japanese art scholar Terry Satsuki Milhaupt wrote for <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nets/hd_nets.htm">a netsuke exhibit</a> she curated at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. For example, as members of the highest class, samurai were allowed to wear two swords as symbols of their rank. But Japan was in the midst of a luxurious, 300-plus-year period of peace, and samurai soon began to spend their money elsewhere. They began carrying fancy pillboxes called <em>inrō</em>, which, like any hanging thing, required a counterweight and anchor.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67130/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>But in the 17th century, netsuke shifted from functional items to must-have accessories, when they became part of a widely spreading addiction. The Portuguese had just introduced tobacco to Japan, and pipe-smoking became a new craze. Many Japanese men carried tobacco and a lighter on their person at all times, stoking demand for yet more netsuke, Okada writes. The items had also become status symbols for a newly rich and ascendant merchant class that sought to flaunt wealth without breaking sumptuary laws, Milhaupt writes. Though the shogun passed an edict forbidding the use of tobacco in 1609, the law was repealed in 1716 in the hope that tobacco production would help lift the economy. It did.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67133/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Netsuke carving had grown from a hobby of traditional artists such as mask carvers or sculptors into its own form. Artists began to specialize in netsuke and developed their own schools and styles. In Shimane Prefecture, carvers of the early and celebrated Iwami school never made the same netsuke twice. Netsuke, as a form of art, grew into political and social commentary that seemed to escape the watchful eyes of the government. Craftspeople began to carve objects satirizing leadership or expressing subversive religious thoughts and feelings, Okada writes<em>. </em>Some even veered into the ribald, conveniently small enough for any grotesque or erotic theme to be unnoticed by a passing Tokugawa military authority, according to Milhaupt.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67132/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>But netsuke came in many forms, Okada writes. Most common were the tiny sculptures known as <em>katabori</em> netsuke, three-dimensional carved figures. But there were also <em>anabori </em>netsuke (hollow trinkets carves from clams), <em>ryusa</em> netsuke (discs so intricately carved that light could pass through), and mask netsuke, which resembled tiny theatrical masks. Certain netsuke led elaborate double lives, perhaps as an ashtray to catch smoldering ashes from a gentleman’s pipe, or as a compass. Other historical examples functioned as whistles, sundials, abacuses, brush rests, and even firefly cages. There were even trick netsuke, crafted out of mundane moving parts that would open to reveal a surprise, such as a tiny goddess nestled between two halves of a nut.</p>
<p>According to Okada, the most common netsuke depicted figures from Japanese and Chinese legend, such as the <em>shishi</em> (lion-dog) or the creatures of the zodiac. Human-shaped netsuke were rarely heroes, but rather characters from folklore or kabuki actors, which could be rendered in far less detail but remain recognizable. At the dawn of the 19th century, netsuke began to reflect scenes from everyday life, such as ordinary townsfolk doing daily chores.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67129/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>The most status-granting carvings were made from any material considered rare. While many were carved from ivory, artists also experimented in wood, amber, antelope horn, persimmon, boxwood, narwhal tooth, boar tusk, hornbill beak, and many other mediums,art collector Anne Hull Grundy wrote in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/4629147.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fdefault-2%2Fcontrol&amp;refreqid=search%3Ab47c77923a9a0d537b157df3c23ef8a7&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"><em>Netsuke Carvers of the Iwami School</em></a>.</p>
<p>As netsuke become flashier and more intricate, it no longer was enough to just have one fancy example. The flashy and stylish began wearing season-specific netsuke, and it was highly unfashionable to wear one at the wrong time of year. “If someone wears a chrysanthemum and it’s not an autumn month, you’d say, 'Oof, why is he wearing a chrysanthemum?'” Mintz says.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67120/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>The golden age of netsuke art arrived at the beginning of the 19th century, according to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=h5rTAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=netsuke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiczOjZ7drjAhWXZs0KHc0YBNYQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=netsuke&amp;f=false"><em>Contemporary Netsuke</em></a> by Miriam Kinsey. Professional carvers abounded in major cities, and to prove their prowess, true masters might etch entire poems on the bottom of the figurines, which could only be read with a magnifying glass. As certain carvers became famous, Mintz says, sneaky, less-accomplished carvers might forge the name of a great on their own substandard creations. “There are a few famous carvers whose names were used over and over, even after they died, because they were popular and famous,” he says. “But the crude ones are still really kind of charming.”</p>
<p>If netsuke’s rise in popularity was always tied to tobacco, so was its fall. When Commodore Perry landed on Japanese shores in 1953, foreign trade reopened for the first time in over two centuries, Okada writes. Japanese men began dressing in Western clothing—styles notoriously packed with pockets—and replaced small-bowl pipes with cigarettes, which eliminated the need for a tobacco pouch.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67116/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Netsuke disappeared as a functional item and status symbol, but found a second life as collector’s items. People from the United States and Europe grew fascinated by the intricate miniatures and began acquiring them, Kinsey writes. This passion persists today, with a <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/Netsuke-Collecting-Guide-5-Things-to-Know-7963-1.aspx">subculture in collecting</a> similar to the collector’s market for Japanese swords or snuff bottles. In the 21st century, the art of netsuke is far from forgotten. Today, many netsuke artists eschew ivory, in compliance with international bans on trading African elephant ivory, according to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/japan-illegal-ivory-trade-african-elephants/"><em>National Geographic</em></a><em>. </em>These contemporary netsuke makers instead opt for the plastic elforyn, or sustainable natural materials including wood, deer antler, metal, and stone.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67122/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Founded in 1975, the <a href="https://www.netsuke.org/contemporaryartists">International Netsuke Society</a> publishes a quarterly journal describing netsuke of note and spotlighting modern artists—many of whom hail from outside Japan—and workshops open to the public. Like kimonos, netsuke are still worn today, though usually not the vintage examples, which live in the cabinets of museums and dedicated collectors, as a distinctive national art form. “If you think of quintessential Italian art, you imagine frescoes or oil paintings, while the symbol of Japan is this tiny little goofy sculpture,” Mintz says. “I find that kind of amazing.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.netsukekan.jp/en/">Kyoto Seishu Netsuke Art Museum</a> is the only museum in the world dedicated to these tiny treasures. Housed in a beautifully restored two-story samurai residence, it specializes in contemporary work and displays around 400 figurines at a time, from <a href="https://www.netsukekan.jp/en/collection/m_44/">an aviator penguin chick</a> to <a href="https://www.netsukekan.jp/en/collection/m_15/">beavers in love</a>. While the museum displays the most intricate examples under magnifying glasses, it wouldn’t hurt to bring your own.</p>]]>

      <title>What's Silver, Purple, and Very Well-Traveled?</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Tucked into a far corner of the annex to Carolina Rediviva, the main library at Sweden’s Uppsala University, a book sits alone behind bulletproof glass. You might think its remote placement indicates its minor significance. But look closer and you'll see a work of visual splendor—a uniform script in silver and gold ink, written on purple parchment, as bright and vibrant as if it were brand-new</p>
<p>This is the Codex Argenteus, or Silver Bible. Created more than 1,500 years ago in northern Italy, it was commissioned by the ruler of a people long since vanished. But their lost language is preserved on the pages of the book before you.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the story of how this bible ended up on display at a Swedish university is as mysterious as the book is beautiful.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67104/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>The codex arrived here in 1669, when Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, a Swedish nobleman of French ancestry, donated it to his alma mater. His hope was that it would remain there forever, and thus strengthen the historical bond between the Swedes and the Goths, a lost people believed to be their ancestors.</p>
<p>But the Silver Bible’s journey to Uppsala began in the sixth century, in the northern Italian city of Ravenna. The king there, Theoderic the Great, wanted to turn Ravenna into a capital city worthy of his imperial ambitions. The Silver Bible was part of his plan, and it’s clearly a book that’s meant to impress—a copy of a fourth-century translation of the Bible from Greek to Gothic, an extinct Germanic language once spoken from the Black Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. Of its original 336 parchment folios, only 187 remain today. All of them are dyed purple, a color so expensive to produce in the ancient world that it was reserved exclusively for emperors.</p>
<p>But by the time of his death, in 526, Theoderic’s kingdom had broken apart. Soon after his passing, Ravenna’s importance began to fade too. The Silver Bible disappeared, and for a thousand years its whereabouts were unknown.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67106/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>In the middle of the 16th century, however, the opulent bible was rediscovered—on a shelf in the library of a Benedictine monastery in Werden, Germany. No one knows for sure how or when it arrived there. Nor does anyone know who found it or broadcast its existence. What we do know is that in 1569, parts of the Gospel of Mark showed up in the Netherlands, printed in Gothic. The origin of those excerpts could only have been the Silver Bible.</p>
<p>Seven years later, in 1576, Rudolf II ascended the throne as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. An eccentric obsessed with the occult, Rudolf established his court at Prague Castle, where he began collecting books from all over Europe. One of the books he acquired was the Silver Bible.</p>
<p>The book remained in Prague until the end of the Thirty Years War. Though hostilities had ceased by the summer of 1648, the Swedish army staged a final push to strengthen its position at a peace congress then under way in Westphalia. In July, the Swedes descended on Prague, and when the city fell, a looting spree began. One of the books carted off to Sweden by the victors was the Silver Bible. Once it reached Stockholm, it became part of Queen Christina’s personal library.</p>
<p>Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie and Queen Christina were friends, with a close relationship that went back years. But in 1653, after a falling out, the queen banished him from her court. Soon after, she converted to Catholicism, abdicated the throne, and left for Rome. Her court librarian, the Dutch scholar Isaac Vossius, joined her on the journey. Strapped for cash, the queen paid his back salary in books—one of which was the Silver Bible.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67109/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, De la Gardie’s luck turned again. Queen Christina’s successor, Charles X Gustav, was the nobleman's brother-in-law, and he soon appointed De la Gardie chancellor of Uppsala University. De la Gardie contacted Vossius, who was then in Amsterdam, and purchased the Silver Bible for 400 marks, or $15,000 in today’s U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>For the next three centuries, it seemed as if the Silver Bible had found a safe home. But on April 15, 1995, the book’s existence was upended once again. Two men wearing gas masks walked into the Carolina Rediviva, smashed the bible’s glass display case, and grabbed what was inside. As they ran off, they sprayed tear gas to elude capture. A month later, the stolen goods were discovered in a deposit box at Stockholm Central Station. The perpetrators have never been identified.</p>
<p>Today, the Silver Bible is encased in bulletproof glass, bathed in the soft glow of a light designed to protect its ancient pages. If its benefactor De la Gardie has his way, it will remain there forever this time, in the university's “eternal possession.”</p>]]>

The scorching heat of summer and sticky humidity of monsoon season give way to mild, golden days and cool nights so thick with fog you sometimes can't see three feet in front of you. In the twisted alleyways of Lucknow's bazaars, which have served as bastions of high culinary and poetic culture for centuries, winter mist means one thing: <em>nimish.</em> Light, frothy, and impossibly rich, this melt-in-the-mouth boiled milk foam pudding, delicately scented with rose water and nuts, is a quintessential winter food. Come summer, the delicate foam flops, the milk growing quickly rancid in the punishing sun.</p>
<p>Called <em>daulat ki chaat</em> in Old Delhi <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/opinions/the-magic-and-mystery-behind-the-making-of-daulat-ki-chaat-1268294">and <em>malayo</em> in Varanasi</a>, nimish's mythology fits perfectly into the Urdu literary culture endemic to this refined city. And like a traditional poetic gathering, preparing nimish is an all-night affair. Around 5:00 p.m., nimish makers boil milk and cream. They then set the boiled, cooled milk in a clay pot outside <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/opinions/the-magic-and-mystery-behind-the-making-of-daulat-ki-chaat-1268294">to absorb droplets of nighttime dew</a>. Some cooks say the dewdrops help aerate the boiled milk, leading to the pudding's fluffy texture. Others—echoing the city's literary romanticism—say nimish can be prepared only <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/tried-and-tasted-how-daulat-ki-chaat-got-it-s-name-where-to-have-the-best-in-delhi/story-QB16cK2MuAV8TtMXHzmzGM.html">on a cool, full-moon night</a>. By morning, the dew-infused mixture is whipped for hours until it achieves perfect foamy peaks, then flavored with rose water and cardamom and topped with slivered almonds and <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/warq-edible-silver-garnish">silver <em>warq</em></a>. </p>
<p>The dish's diversity of names only adds to the romance of its preparation. In particular, nobody quite knows how the Old Delhi variant, daulat ki chaat, received its title. For North Indians, <em>chaat</em> normally designates <a href="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/aloo-tikki-aloo-pattice-recipe-made-from-leftover-potatoes/">street snacks such as <em>aloo tikki</em></a> with tamarind sauce. <em>Daulat</em> normally designates wealth of the material kind. <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/tried-and-tasted-how-daulat-ki-chaat-got-it-s-name-where-to-have-the-best-in-delhi/story-QB16cK2MuAV8TtMXHzmzGM.html">One explanation suggests</a> that <em>chaat</em> comes from the Hindi word "to lick," while <em>daulat </em>refers to the sweet's ephemerality. So if you're lucky enough to be in Lucknow or Old Delhi in the winter, take advantage of the cool weather and enjoy a dish that can be as fleeting and sweet as good fortune.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Last week, Atlas Obscura <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/first-journey-finalists-announcement">announced the five finalists</a> for <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/first-journey"><strong>First Journey</strong></a>, the competition we launched earlier this year to send one of our readers on their first real journey. The idea was inspired by our co-founders, <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/co-founder-dylan-thuras-eastern-europe">Dylan Thuras</a> and <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/co-founder-josh-foer-road-trip">Josh Foer</a>, who both went on transformative journeys of their own when they were younger. This year being Atlas Obscura’s 10th anniversary, we decided to celebrate by giving someone out there—a person with an amazing idea who just needed the means to pull it off—$15,000 to take a meaningful, life-changing trip.</p>
<p>Thousands applied, and our panel of judges spent weeks narrowing down an incredibly impressive field of applicants to just <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/first-journey-finalists-announcement">a handful of finalists</a>. Each of the four runners-up is being awarded $500, which we hope will serve as seed money toward making their journeys a reality.</p>
<p>And now, at last, we couldn’t be more thrilled to announce that the winner of First Journey—who receives $15,000, logistical support, and will be featured on Atlas Obscura—is… <strong>Jenn Smith</strong> of North Adams, Massachusetts!</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67070/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Growing up in Western Massachusetts, Smith had a classic 1980s American kid’s bedroom, with a few twists. The walls were pink and bordered with unicorn wallpaper. The My Little Ponies were kept in a small suitcase. The Archie and Batman comics were plentiful. And on one wall was a poster, scooped up at a yard sale, of the Taj Mahal. It coordinated nicely with the globe she received as a gift during elementary school. On that globe, right on the spot marking <a class="destination-link article-destination-link" title="Things to do in Kolkata, India" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/kolkata-india" data-destination-link-kind="article" data-geo-id="1456" data-title="Kolkata, India" data-slug="kolkata-india">Kolkata, India</a>, was a hand-drawn star.</p>
<p>Smith was born in an orphanage in Kolkata and has no memories of her birthplace. She was adopted at a young age by a loving U.S. family of Irish-Polish-Lithuanian descent, and raised as an only child. Now 37, she’s never traveled back to India, despite long yearning to do so. With her $15,000 prize, she’ll spend three months traveling around India this fall, with plans to participate in up to a dozen different festivals.</p>
<p>“I’m just really excited to be there,” says Smith, “to learn and find the things that I don’t get a chance to read about in books or see on mainstream TV.”</p>
<p>As “a bookworm of a kid,” Smith took any opportunity to immerse herself in information about India. At the children’s library, she gravitated toward the geography section. For social-studies assignments, she’d write about Indian elephants. In middle school she made a valiant attempt to cook puri, a fried, unleavened Indian bread, at home. With no deep fryer in the house, she improvised with oil in a soup pot, but the oil wasn’t hot enough and the flour wasn’t right. She ended up with “small, slightly puffy fried dough balls” and a kitchen that reeked of burned vegetable oil.</p>
<p>In college at Syracuse University, Smith took a South Asian studies course and met some Indian students. Talking to those who grew up in Indian families brought forth some thorny issues about identity—namely, says Smith, “feeling fraudulent about it. I have this identity, but I wasn’t raised or taught in this culture. So how Indian am I, really?”</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67084/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>In her First Journey application, Smith wrote that she “worked multiple jobs during the school year and throughout the summer” to be able to afford college, and was never able to study abroad or save up for the trip to <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/india">India</a> she so badly wanted to take. Working multiple jobs turns out to be a bit of a theme in Smith’s life—she currently has two, one as a community engagement editor and reporter at the local newspaper, the <em>Berkshire Eagle</em>, and another at Tunnel City Coffee, a coffee shop and bakery in Williamstown, Massachusetts. Smith is grateful that both of her employers have agreed to let her take time off to go on her journey, and says she’s relieved that she’ll be able to “set people up for success to fill in for me while I'm gone.”</p>
<p>Both of Smith’s jobs require her to be relatively outgoing, but during her journey, she does wonder how she’ll manage without being able to speak Hindi or Bengali, the latter being the most commonly spoken language in Kolkata. On her trip, “I’ll blend in, I’m sure, in facial appearance, but if I open my mouth I’m clearly not from India.” That feeling of not fitting in and potentially being judged for it is something she’s a little nervous about. But such worries also provide an opportunity for self-reflection, against the backdrop of India’s caste-system legacy. After a lifetime of absorbing information about her birth country from across the world, Smith is ready to immerse herself in it.</p>
<p>“I think the biggest thing I’m craving is context,” she says. “Tangible, first-hand, visceral sensory context. I’m sure I have my own notions and even unconscious biases, but I don’t want to feed into that. I really want to let India, let this culture, let all these festivals I’m hoping to take part in speak for themselves.”</p>
<p>“All these festivals” means a dozen in 90 days, all over the country. It’s an ambitious itinerary, and one that promises an explosion of sights, sounds, and flavors: “The best food, the best, most beautiful flowers, the most traditional songs.” Festivals are amazing because, says Smith, “you try to have your best attitude, put away your differences, and just get along with people to have a good day. Or in the case of Indian culture, a good, like, eight days.”</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67072/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>One standout festival on her itinerary: Ganesh Chaturthi, a birthday celebration for the elephant-headed Hindu god. The week-and-a-half-long commemoration ends with a procession of clay Ganesh idols toward a body of water. These idols, which have been crafted by artisans, are then immersed in the lake, river, or sea. “There’s something I kind of dig about creating something for hours, making something so beautiful, and then just lowering it into the ocean,” says Smith.</p>
<p>By attending festivals like these, Smith hopes to experience—and share with Atlas Obscura readers—a version of India that goes beyond stereotypes, simplifications, and fear-based reports of the country. When you think of the common perceptions of India, she says, “you think of terrorism, or sex trafficking abuses; pollution.” Or yoga retreats. “I just know that there’s so much more to the country. And that’s something that I want to experience for myself, but I also want to share with others.”</p>
<p>Smith took a similar approach when she went on a reporting exchange to Pakistan in 2014. The very idea of that trip made her mother, Cheryl, cry, but Smith was determined to see aspects of the country that go under-reported in the U.S. media. “That was my big thing,” she says. “What people can I meet that will prove my theory that this country is so much more than how it’s been typecast?”</p>
<p>Despite being right next door, Smith still didn’t make it to India. When she finally gets there this fall, she expects she’ll continue to seek out untold stories—and her mom will continue to worry about her. But that’s just a reflection of how close-knit their family is, and how encouraging they have been toward their daughter. “I’ve known a lot of adoptees, and some adoptees are not ever told about where they came from or their past,” she says. “But my adoptive family was so supportive in letting me know that I came from a different country than the one I lived in.”</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67086/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Other major supporters: friends, particularly the “amazing” Ed, a kayak engineer and Jenn, a puppeteer and Smith’s best friend in high school. Mutually obsessed with the 1993 martial arts film <em>Only the Strong</em>, the teenage Jenns would “pretend to capoeira each other in the hallway.” In 2014, Smith officiated Jenn and Ed’s wedding. And a couple of years ago for Smith’s birthday, Jenn and Ed gave her a card and some seed money for a very specific purpose: that trip to India she’d always been talking about. It was “a vote of confidence” that made Smith even more determined to go. She wrote in her journal that she would like to make the trip before age 38. In August, aged 37 years and five months, she’ll arrive in Delhi.</p>
<p>Smith’s itinerary has her traveling from Delhi down to the west coast, to Goa and Kerala. Then she’ll head northeast to Kolkata, where she’ll finally see the birthplace she’s spent so much time imagining. “I have this Google Earth image of the address where I was born,” she says. “Just being able to stand there for a moment, just be there? I’m really looking forward to experiencing that.”</p>]]>

      <title>Ethiopia Just Set the World Record for Most Trees Planted in a Day</title>
      <dc:creator>Evan Nicole Brown</dc:creator>

      <guid>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ethiopia-world-record-trees-planted-deforestation</guid>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On June 22, 2013, Pakistan’s Sindh Forest Department set a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-trees-planted-in-24-hours-(team)?fb_comment_id=689973211099913_992997574130807/">Guinness World Record</a> when 300 people planted 847,275 trees in 24 hours. Three years later, on July 11, 2016, India eclipsed that mark, planting <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/india-plants-50-million-trees-uttar-pradesh-reforestation/">49.3 million</a> tree saplings (comprising 80 different species) in the same amount of time.</p>
<p>But yesterday, the arboreal record was shattered again—in half the time. A nationwide planting spree in Ethiopia saw volunteers plant more than 350 million trees across 1,000 designated sites—in just 12 hours.</p>
<p>This latest eco-challenge was designed as part of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s “Green Legacy Initiative,” a reforestation plan to address Ethiopia’s rapid tree loss. At the start of the 20th century, 30 percent of the country’s land was forested. Now, less than 4 <a href="https://www.farmafrica.org/media/press-releases/post/720-economic-incentives-help-stem-deforestation-in-ethiopia">percent</a> of it is.</p>
<p>Ethiopia is not alone when it comes to tree loss. In 2015, 10 African countries launched the <a href="http://afr100.org/">African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative</a>, which aims to restore <a href="https://www.wri.org/news/2015/12/release-african-countries-launch-afr100-restore-100-million-hectares-land">386,000 square miles</a> of the continent's land by 2030.</p>
<p>The benefits are legion.</p>
<p>“Restoring our landscapes brings prosperity, security, and opportunity,” Vincent Biruta, Rwanda’s minister of natural resources, <a href="https://www.wri.org/news/2015/12/release-african-countries-launch-afr100-restore-100-million-hectares-land">said at the time</a>. “With forest landscape restoration, we’ve seen agricultural yields rise and farmers in our rural communities diversify their livelihoods and improve their well-being. Forest landscape restoration is not just an environmental strategy; it is an economic and social development strategy as well.”</p>
<p>As part of this effort, Ethiopia pledged to tackle 57,915 square miles of its landscape. On July 29, Prime Minister Ahmed encouraged <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/africa/ethiopia-plants-350-million-trees-intl-hnk/index.html">millions</a> of Ethiopians to each plant a minimum of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/ethiopia-plants-250m-trees-in-a-day-to-help-tackle-climate-crisis">40 seedlings</a>. The citizenry took him very seriously. Some schools and government offices closed to encourage full participation.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67112/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Ethiopia’s primary industry is agriculture, which has contributed to frequent droughts—and forest decline—thanks to land degradation. The “Green Legacy” campaign to re-green the east African country aims to counteract that—and climate change more generally—by planting <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49151523">4 billion indigenous trees</a> between May and October, the rainy season.</p>
<p>Trees offset climate change’s effects by absorbing <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/india-plants-50-million-trees-uttar-pradesh-reforestation/">carbon dioxide</a>—a large contributor to greenhouse gases—from the air. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/29/ethiopia-plants-250m-trees-in-a-day-to-help-tackle-climate-crisis">According</a> to Dan Ridley-Ellis, head of Edinburgh Napier University’s Center for Wood Science and Technology, trees are a particularly effective antidote to the predations of climate change, “combating desertification and land degradation, particularly in arid countries. They also provide food, shelter, fuel, fodder, medicine, materials, and protection of the water supply.”</p>
<p>While planting millions and millions of trees is a huge step in the right direction, more strides need to be taken. If the saplings in Ethiopia aren’t watered properly in the coming weeks, for instance, they’ll be susceptible to disease and death—which would undermine the heroic efforts Ethiopians just made.</p>
<p>The country's record-breaking tree-planting day is nothing if not timely. Earlier in July, a study published in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/24"><em>Science</em></a> argued that planting a trillion new trees over the next few decades could absorb roughly <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/04/world/forests-capture-two-thirds-of-carbon-emissions-scn-intl/index.html">205 billion tons</a> of carbon dioxide from our compromised atmosphere.</p>
<p>Time will tell if Ethiopia’s recent effort has planted the seeds for a brighter—and greener—tomorrow.</p>]]>

      <title>Stare Into the Belly of the Earth With 17th-Century Polymath Athanasius Kircher</title>
      <dc:creator>Jessica Leigh Hester</dc:creator>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 17:30:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The pair set out after midnight, clambering up steep, rugged Mount Vesuvius in the dark. The path toward the 4,200-foot summit was rough, but Athanasius Kircher and his <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/2012/11/01/athanasius-underground/">unnamed Italian guide</a> kept at it. They climbed and climbed until they reached a crater.</p>
<p>There, they were transfixed. It was awesome in every sense of the word—tremendous, terrible, fearsome.</p>
<p>“I saw it all lit up by fire,” Kircher <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2012/04/30/happy-birthday-athanasius-kircher/">later wrote</a>, “with an intolerable exhalation of sulfur and burning bitumen.” The smell was so unbearable that Kircher kept heaving up the contents of his stomach. And he was scared, too. With the “groaning and shaking of the dreadful mountain,” he went on, “I believed I was peering into the realm of the dead, and seeing the horrid phantasms of demons.”</p>
<p>It was the 1630s, and the passionate Jesuit scholar, priest, and scientist—and Atlas Obscura hero—wanted a glimpse into the belly of the Earth.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67108/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Maybe things looked slightly less dyspeptic in the morning, or maybe Kircher spent the remainder of the night gathering his courage. Either way, when day broke, he climbed down into the crater. There, he saw a straight, hollow chute—“all up and down everywhere, cragged and broken,” opening into a pool “boiling with an everlasting gushing forth, and streaming of smoke and flames.” (English translations of his writings vary slightly, but they’re all powerfully sensory and overwhelming.)</p>
<p>Kircher went on with his life, but the scene was seared into his memory. On Vesuvius, writes <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/2012/11/01/athanasius-underground/">Kircher biographer John Glassie</a><em>, </em>he had begun “to envision what it might be like even deeper within the earth, and how the mountains and fires and rivers and oceans might somehow all be connected.” Kircher couldn’t stop thinking about it, and he eventually put his vision into a fascinating, prescient, detailed map of the inner-workings of the planet.</p>
<p>For as long as people have walked the Earth, they’ve looked up in wonder. Like many natural philosophers before him, Kircher studied the Moon, and <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/historic-moon-maps-astronomy-exhibit">mapped its mottled face</a>. But Kircher also looked down, and devoted much of a hefty tome, <em>Mundus Subterraneus</em>, to the world beneath our feet. It was a journey, as he put it, into “the fecund womb of Nature.” Two of the prints made to accompany the 1665 edition are <a href="https://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/pyrophylaciorum3-kircher-1665">currently for sale</a> through Geographicus Rare Antique Maps.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption zoomable-image"><img class="article-image with-structured-caption zoomable-image" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67102/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-article-image-id="undefined" data-full-size-image="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/full/67102/image" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Far below us, Kircher figured, there was a series of buried lakes and rivers, which he imagined <a href="https://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/quvexprimituraquarum3-kircher-1665">winding toward the planet’s core like blood vessels</a>. And fire—so much fire. Nearly three decades after his trek into Vesuvius, Kircher was still trying to understand what these molten rivers might have to do with earthquakes and other natural phenomena.</p>
<p>At the time, a prevailing idea posited center of the Earth as a fiery warren. In the 17th century, writes <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932707000051">archivist Frances Willmoth</a> in the science history journal <em>Endeavor</em>, many natural philosophers were convinced that the Earth was “riddled with passages, large caverns, smaller channels and cavities, all capable of transmitting air, water and other substances.” Like Seneca, Aristotle, and others, Willmoth writes, some of these scientists theorized that earthquakes were the product of air and water rushing through those channels; many speculated that thunder or lightning played a role, too.</p>
<p>In <em>Mundus Subterraneus, </em>Kircher depicts the very center of the Earth as a fireball. In his print, it looks like a central lake of flame with jagged rivers stretching out to feed roughly a dozen volcanoes depicted on the surface, like vents. Elsewhere in the book, Kircher also imagined <a href="https://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/quvexprimituraquarum3-kircher-1665">a system of underground seas and rivers</a>, and the interplay between the water and fire. In Kircher’s view, writes <a href="https://www.geographicus.com/P/AntiqueMap/pyrophylaciorum3-kircher-1665">Kevin Brown of Geographicus</a>, “the volcanic system interacted with the hydrosystem by superheating parts of it, causing the movement of water to and from the surface—hence ocean currents, earthquakes, tides, and more.”</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67103/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Kircher’s map looks fantastical, as does the totality of his theories, but centuries of science have borne out some of his ideas. “His hypothesis of a central source of heat inside the planet, and his realization that volcanoes and earthquakes are a global phenomenon, are now widely accepted,” NASA’s <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2012/04/30/happy-birthday-athanasius-kircher/">Earth Observatory notes</a>. We know that volcanoes do tend to cluster, and that their eruptions coincide with molten movement deep within the Earth, even if they don’t quite look like Kircher thought they would.</p>
<p>There are many more volcanoes than Kircher’s map suggests—<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-active-volcanoes-are-there-earth?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products">as many as 1,500 potentially active ones</a>, discounting the “continuous belt” of <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/mid-atlantic-ridge-volcanic-processes/">underwater ones along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). By the agency's count, about a third of these have erupted in recorded history. Many of the feistiest occupy what is known as the <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/fire.html">Ring of Fire</a>, where <a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/volcano-eruptions-through-2010/">tectonic plates collide</a>. We also know, of course, that the core is definitely hot—up to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/core/">10,800 degrees Fahrenheit</a>—though made mostly of iron and nickel, not an open, flickering flame.</p>
<p>Even as we <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/biggest-telescope-black-hole">peer ever-deeper into space</a>, the world below our feet is largely a mystery to those of us who aren’t geologists, planetary scientists, or cavers. Nature writer Robert Macfarlane observes as much in his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Underland-Deep-Journey-Robert-Macfarlane/dp/0393242145"><em>Underland</em></a>, which takes readers into crevasses, caves, and other claustrophobic corners of the world. “We can look up and see the Moon,” he said at a recent talk in New York, “but we look down and only see our feet.” Hundreds of years after Kircher climbed down into Vesuvius, there’s still much to learn about what’s down there, and you don’t need to stumble into volcano to be awestruck.</p>]]>

      <title>Chatham Artillery Punch</title>

        <![CDATA[<p><img alt="" data-width="1080" data-height="1350" width="300" height="200" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvdGhpbmdfaW1hZ2VzLzkwNWRmOTljLTFiMzAtNDYxMy1iYzY3LTJiMmY5ODBlM2MzM2RjMTZmOTRlMDc3MmU0Y2FjY180NDgyNjM0OF8yNjM4NjUxNTA5NjcwOTFfNTMzNjEzOTc1MTYwNzY4MDAwNF9uLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCIiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIyJdXQ/44826348_263865150967091_5336139751607680004_n.jpg" /></p> <p>An 1885 article for the <em>Augusta</em> <em>Chronicle</em> ascribes near-mythic strength to Chatham Artillery Punch, cautioning readers that "As a vanquisher of men its equal has never been found."</p>
<p>The journalist accredits one A.H. Luce with inventing this potent, large-format cocktail in the 1850s, in honor of a celebration between the Chatham Artillery and the Republican Blues, a volunteer regiment. <a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/dining-news/drink-chatham-artillery-punch/">According to David Wondrich</a>, author of <em>Punch: The Delights (and Dangers) of the Flowing Bowl,</em> such regiments existed to teach young men about the use of arms, but "mostly it was a chance to sit around in exclusive company and drink a lot.” To sate the crowd of merrymakers, Luce grabbed a bucket, filled it with crushed ice, lemon juice, and sugar, then mixed in rum, brandy, whiskey, and champagne. </p>
<p>Members of the Chatham Artillery kept the concoction in rotation, but it rose to fame when a group of journalists visiting Savannah encountered the lethal libation on a riverboat cruise. After the writers published sensational reports about being obliterated by Savannah’s Chatham Artillery Punch, readers tried to figure out what, exactly, had done them in. Countless variations sprung into existence, calling for everything from Catawba wine and rum to maraschino cherries, scotch, and gin. Savannah's visitors of status, including President Chester A. Arthur and Admiral George Dewey, also succumbed to the powers of the punch, which only fueled its intrigue and infamy. </p>
<p>As anti-alcohol sentiments grew in the early 20th century, recipes began to reflect the watered-down wills of the temperance movement. After prohibition ended, Chatham Artillery Punch reappeared on the scene in the 1930s, reflecting decades' worth of recipe modifications. But it wasn't just a game of telephone that altered the elixir's composition. <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/drink-the-book-chatham-artillery-punch-original-recipe-wondrich.html">As a recipe note from 1907</a> phrased it, "Experience has taught the rising generation to modify the receipt of their forefathers to conform to the weaker constitutions of their progeny."</p>]]>

      <title>Found: A Mysterious Warrior From Late Iron Age England</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>A housing development, West Sussex, England. That’s where the Late Iron Age warrior appeared in 2007. It’s the kind of place that most of them show up these days, what with the digging and all. When he emerged, the warrior was clad in dense mud—in his eye sockets, between his ribs—that held his precious cargo in place for more than 2,000 years. After years of analysis and conservation, the material he was buried with will be going on public display, at <a href="http://www.thenovium.org">The Novium Museum</a> in Chichester.</p>
<p>Though he was unearthed about 50 miles from London, archaeologists now believe this ancient fighter, known as "Bersted Man," may not have been English at all. Analysis dated the skeleton to about 50 BC, during Julius Caesar’s campaign against the Gallic tribes of what is today France. That year might sound familiar to fans of the French <a href="https://www.asterix.com/en/">Asterix comics series</a>, which had for decades chronicled the adventures of a village of Gauls holding out against the Roman legions. Bersted Man may be a warrior from the same conflict.</p>

<p>Andrew Fitzpatrick, an archaeological consultant at the University of Leicester, says that the isotope analysis they conducted does not operate with “postcode precision,” so the warrior’s country of origin is uncertain, as is his allegiance in the Roman-Gallic conflict. But the items buried with him—an elaborate headdress and helmet, a bent sword, and various other trinkets—tell the story of a soldier of considerable importance for the time, and suggest he was Gallic.</p>
<p>“Many swords similar to the one buried with Bersted Man have been found in northeast France and the ritual of 'killing' weapons by bending them is also well-known there, but both are rare in Britain,” says Fitzpatrick. “We think it is most likely that he grew up on the continent. He may have arrived in Britain as a ‘conflict migrant.’”</p>

<p>The historian Plutarch wrote that about a million Gauls were killed in the campaign and another million enslaved. Some Gallic fighters may have absconded to Britannia—not yet governed by the Roman Empire—rather than face the legions.</p>
<p>Though the helmet is of a fairly common style, the headdress is unique, says Fitzpatrick. Given the size and weight of its latticework, he adds, “How the man looked was more important than how practical the headdress was to wear.”</p>
<p>Without the helmet and headdress, the warrior would’ve stood at 5’8”, according to Melanie Giles, an archaeologist at the University of Manchester, slightly above average at the time. But with the elaborate topper, says Giles, “You can imagine this was a most impressive sight.”</p>

<p>There is still much to be learned about Bersted Man, but it is clear that he lived in a time fraught with world-shaping military ambitions that put a variety of cultures into contact with one another. The Gallic Wars ended in a Roman victory, and were vital to Julius Caesar’s trajectory toward domination of the Roman Empire. The holdouts of Asterix’s comics were, so far as we know, pure fiction, like the magic potion that enabled their resistance.</p>]]>

      <title>Meet the Scientists Who Pollute Lakes on Purpose</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On a morning in June last summer, Keval Shah boarded a motorboat on a lake in northwestern Ontario, wearing navy coveralls, rubber gloves, and a respirator mask. He and nine others, all dressed in similar protective gear, were going to do something they had never done before: spill nearly 90* gallons of oil into the lake.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next two hours, Shah and his colleagues—a team of environmental technicians, chemists, boat drivers and photographers—carefully piped the viscous liquid into a series of sectioned-off zones in the lake. “We were all laser-focused,” he says. The operation, part of an ongoing project, was designed to simulate oil spills for scientific research. For the past three summers, scientists have been studying deliberate spills to find out more about how oil affects lakes in boreal regions, forested landscapes that stretch across northern Canada, Russia and Alaska.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67014/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>The project is one of the first of its kind, says Jules Blais, professor of biology at the University of Ottawa and one of the project’s leaders. Most oil spill studies are conducted inside test-tubes or after accidental spills. These conditions have their limits. Lab experiments can only mimic simplified versions of complex ecosystems. And when disasters strike, the focus is on cleaning up oil as fast as possible, not on collecting scientific data. There is also a lack of baseline information at accidental spill sites. “It’s like arriving at the scene of an accident,” Blais says—you don’t know what happened, how it happened and what was there before, making it harder to compare conditions from before and after. By closely monitoring manufactured spills in boreal lakes, researchers are hoping to gain insight into oils’ effects on the environment in real-world conditions, which could help policymakers and the oil industry develop better ways of managing spills in the future.</p>
<p>Deliberately polluting a lake might seem like a wonky way of protecting the environment. But the <a href="https://www.iisd.org/ela/">International Institute for Sustainable Development Experimental Lakes Area</a> (IISD-ELA), the facility where the research is being conducted, is famous for it. The area consists of 58 small water bodies within a 75-square-mile swath of boreal forest, and for over 50 years, researchers have been using these lakes as real-life labs. They have poured all sorts of pollutants into their waters, including fertilizers, mercury, sulphuric acid and, for reasons you’ll see shortly, estrogen. Seeing how these toxins affect ecosystems, and often entire lakes, has been instrumental to freshwater research and policymaking. “This kind of research has actually resulted in a dramatic improvement in water quality all over the world,” Blais says. The oil spill project comes at the end of a long line of experiments where poisoning one lake has helped preserve many.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67017/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>This paradox was built into the IISD-ELA right from the start. When the research facility opened in 1968 (then simply referred to as “ELA”), an onslaught of pollution was causing algal blooms, choking oxygen out of the water, and killing fish in Lake Erie, which sits on the border between the United States and Canada. The algal bloom phenomenon, called eutrophication, was poorly understood: A chemical soup of pollutants had been draining into the lake from farms, cities and industrial zones, and researchers didn’t know which pollutant was responsible for triggering the blooms.</p>
<p>Two scientists, Wally Johnson and Jack Vallentyne, were tasked with untangling the root of the eutrophication problem. They thought that whole-lake experiments might provide answers. So they searched through maps to find a suitable spot. They needed an uninhabited region with minimal human influence: No vacation homes, no agriculture, and limited logging.</p>
<p>They settled on a spot about two hours’ drive from Kenora, Ontario, a city on the province’s western edge. “It’s Canadian wilderness at its finest,” says Richard Grosshans, a research scientist with the IISD, the ELA's parent organization. The area is covered in thousands of small, pristine lakes set in bedrock and bordered by thick spruce and pine forests. Still today, only one gravel road leads into the area, which visitors require a permit to use.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67018/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>In the late 1960s, the ELA saw its first suite of experiments to test eutrophication. A team of scientists led by David Schindler, now a professor of ecology at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, strung a plastic curtain through the middle of Lake 226 (each lake is numbered). The researchers poured carbon and nitrogen into both sides of the lake, but added phosphorus to only one. Soon enough, the phosphorus-tainted side clouded over with algae. An aerial photo of the experiment became famous. It’s “the single most powerful image in the history of limnology,” James Elser, a biologist from Arizona State University, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5906/1316">told <em>Science</em></a> in 2008 (limnology is the study of inland aquatic ecosystems). The image convinced policymakers that phosphorus should be controlled. In the 1970s, governments in Canada and the United States passed legislation to ban phosphates in detergents.</p>
<p>Since then, researchers have used the ELA for a variety of high impact experiments. From 1976 to 1993, Schindler and his crew poured sulfuric acid into Lake 223, finding that lake organisms suffered at acidity levels lower than what was considered safe. From 1999 to 2007, another team added mercury to Lake 658, demonstrating how the heavy metal exuded from coal-fired power plants can accumulate in food webs. And from 2000 to 2003, scientists discharged synthetic estrogen into Lake 260. This experiment showed that the hormone, which gets released into wastewater in the urine of people who are on birth control pills, causes male fish to develop female traits, eventually leading to population crashes. Overall, the research persuaded governments to adjust water quality guidelines, supported proposed legislation and got policymakers talking.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67016/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>The ELA is the only place in the world where scientists can manipulate entire lakes and watch the consequences unfold, often over decades, Schindler says. It’s been called “the supercollider of ecology.” Big experiments at the ELA have had a disproportionate influence on policy, says Vince Palace, head research scientist at the IISD-ELA and one of the oil spill project leaders. The science clearly applies to the real world, he says.</p>
<p>Bridging lab experiments and actual ecosystems to better understand the effects of human activities is the ELA’s bread and butter. And the ongoing oil spill study falls right in line with that legacy. Last summer, one team of researchers added oil to eight enclosures throughout Lake 260, mimicking real spills—from small incidents to the 2010 <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/03052018/enbridge-fined-tar-sands-oil-pipeline-inspections-kalamazoo-michigan-dilbit-spill">Kalamazoo River spill</a>, one of the largest freshwater spills in U.S. history. The team studied how the oil moved through water and affected organisms, including bugs, fish, and amphibians. They have yet to release their findings.</p>
<p>This summer, scientists created a fresh set of spills in 18 enclosures along the shoreline. Once they discharged the oil, they removed the bulk of it using conventional cleanup methods, such as soaking up the oil with absorptive pads or spraying the shoreline with low-pressure water hoses. There is always a residue left on the shore and on plants, however, Palace says. The researchers want to find the best ways of sopping up that residual oil. They’ll be testing a variety of cleanup techniques, including shoreline cleaners, natural bacteria and <a href="https://www.iisd.org/project/floating-treatment-wetlands">floating treatment wetlands</a>—untethered islands of native plants that have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-018-0025-7">shown promise</a> in tests in India and Pakistan.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67015/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Experiments like this one and others run by the IISD-ELA, surprisingly, raise little controversy. People typically don’t get upset, and the researchers at the Experimental Lakes Area put a lot of effort into informing the public of their undertakings, says Palace. They hold information sessions with various communities near the research area and post updates on their website as well as social media. They also don’t dump chemicals into lakes willy-nilly. Scientists have to prove to regulators that their experiments won’t have any toxic effects on humans or affect downstream waters. And they are required to return lakes to their natural state within 10 years.</p>
<p>“One of the most important parts of a project like this is not the actual insult,” Palace says. “It’s the recovery.” Now that the oil has been spilled into Lake 260, scientists will probe the soiled sections of the ecosystem for years to come, looking for ways to salvage oil-tainted waters far beyond its shores.</p>

      <title>How Alaska Became Home to Humongous Rhubarb</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>In 1914, the <em>Seattle Star </em>published a picture of a little girl triumphantly holding a huge, leafy stalk above her head like a spear. "Alaska is not all snow and ice," the headline blared. "Rhubarb pies!"</p>
<p>The little girl, Dorothy, was something of a rhubarb princess, being one of the daughters of Henry D. Clark, who was known around Skagway, Alaska, as "the Rhubarb King." Clark didn't rule alone though. Across the United States, from Ohio to California, Washington to Illinois, various "rhubarb kings" were lauded for their ability to grow great quantities of the fruit-vegetable. (While a leafy green, rhubarb's sour stalks are typically treated like a fruit and cooked with lots of sugar. The leaves are toxic.)</p>
<p>But Clark's rule was different. For one thing, he farmed in Skagway, where summer days stretch to 19 hours. Rhubarb turned out to be a serendipitous choice. To the awed delight of early Alaskan farmers, not only does rhubarb like the cold, but it grows to monstrous size under the midnight sun.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/66924/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>According to Dr. Danny L. Barney, former curator of the Arctic and Subarctic Plant Gene Bank in Palmer, Alaska, cultivated rhubarb has a history of hardiness. Likely originating in chilly Tibet and China, it stepped off the steppes to become a valued medicine, with ancient doctors lauding its roots as effective against everything from cancer to the plague. Rhubarb eventually made its way to Russia, and from there to Western Europe, where it found a foothold in <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rhubarb-triangle">chilly England</a>.</p>
<p>For centuries, rhubarb stayed more treatment than treat. As Barney writes in an email, "It was only after processed sugar became widely available [around the mid-1700s] that the acidic and sour stems became popular for culinary use." Soon after, Barney believes, cultivated rhubarb arrived in Alaska when Russian trader Gregorii Shelikhov brought it with him to Kodiak Island in 1784.</p>
<p>By the 19th-century, cheap sugar had enabled rhubarb to become known as "the pie plant." By mixing lots of sugar with its chopped stems, housewives could make a sweet, tangy filling without any citrus or apples. Rhubarb became a kind of fruit substitute, especially in Alaska. After all, many culinary rhubarb varieties are hardy, require minimal care, and thrive in cool climates.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/67036/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>In early 1900s, settlers in the frontier marveled at rhubarb's massive growth potential. Newspapers and books often profiled Clark's farm in particular. The man himself came from humble beginnings, says Caroline Hill, general manager of Jewell Gardens, which occupies part of Clark's old homestead today. Clark hailed from Wisconsin, and trekked to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. On the infamous White Pass Trail, Hill says, Clark witnessed people suffering from scurvy.</p>
<p>"<span data-key="354" data-start="141.21" data-end="141.51">We</span><span data-key="358" data-start="141.87" data-end="142.2"> think</span><span data-key="360" data-start="142.2" data-end="142.32"> that</span><span data-key="362" data-start="142.32" data-end="142.69"> maybe</span><span data-key="364" data-start="142.69" data-end="142.77"> he</span><span data-key="366" data-start="142.77" data-end="142.91"> had</span><span data-key="368" data-start="142.92" data-end="143.4"> rhubarb</span><span data-key="370" data-start="143.4" data-end="143.73"> seeds</span><span data-key="372" data-start="143.73" data-end="143.82"> in</span><span data-key="374" data-start="143.82" data-end="144"> his</span><span data-key="376" data-start="144" data-end="144.57"> pocket," Hill says. On his return to the town of Skagway, Clark established his rhubarb farm⁠—a wise decision, considering the local lack of fresh food. A photo from 1913 shows Clark holding a humongous rhubarb stalk, topped with a large fluffy leaf, along with a yardstick in one hand to demonstrate its size. "That's three feet just there," Hill points out. "I don't think he was an abnormally short or tall man. So it's a very large piece of rhubarb."</span></p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67135/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Along with other varieties, Jewell Gardens still grows Henry Clark's strain of rhubarb, which has a white, pink-tinged stem instead of the usual bright red. Henry Clark's rhubarb also grows throughout the town—a consequence of the farm's tragic end. During World War II, the military commandeered Clark's land to store fuel, says Hill. Townspeople gathered up his rhubarb before it could be destroyed. <span data-key="2020" data-start="506.61" data-end="507.39">While Clark died in 1945, descendants of his plants grow on.</span></p>
<p>Many Alaskans still feel passionately about rhubarb, even though other fruits are easier to buy locally these days. Ruby Hollembaek, who owns a bison and elk ranch near Delta Junction, Alaska, founded the "Alaska Rhubarb" Facebook group almost 10 years ago<strong>.</strong> She sees a bright future for rhubarb. "I<span data-key="1176" data-start="249.85" data-end="249.9">t</span><span data-key="1178" data-start="249.96" data-end="250.05"> is</span><span data-key="1180" data-start="250.05" data-end="250.29"> such</span><span data-key="1182" data-start="250.29" data-end="250.38"> an</span><span data-key="1184" data-start="250.38" data-end="250.65"> easy c</span><span data-key="1188" data-start="250.92" data-end="251.22">rop</span><span data-key="1190" data-start="251.22" data-end="251.37"> to</span><span data-key="1192" data-start="251.37" data-end="251.73"> raise,</span><span data-key="1194" data-start="251.73" data-end="251.82"> and</span><span data-key="1196" data-start="251.82" data-end="251.91"> it's</span><span data-key="1198" data-start="252.06" data-end="252.27"> good</span><span data-key="1200" data-start="252.27" data-end="252.48"> for</span><span data-key="1202" data-start="252.48" data-end="252.72"> you," she says, noting that rhubarb could be a boon for remote communities, where locals depend on imported, often unhealthy foods.</span></p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67067/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>"Traditionalists still like rhubarb," agrees Barney. He has a soft spot for the Crimson Cherry variety. But he acknowledges that the sour stalks, which require a high dose of sugar, are going up against the one-two punch of easily available fruits and a modern fear of high-sugar products. It doesn't help, he says, that with a few exceptions, large-scale farming hasn't proven that successful in Alaska yet.</p>
<p>Barney has since retired to Wasilla, Alaska, and has taken on the task of breeding rhubarb suitable for commercial growers. "Historically, most rhubarb varieties came about as chance seedlings that growers found appealing, named, and cloned," Barney notes, but he carefully chooses plant parents, looking for crosses that produce good features such as size, sweetness, and suitability for juicing. The future of rhubarb, he muses, may lie in the tourism industry. Rhubarb, he hopes, could become Alaska's calling card: the star of "specialty culinary dishes unique to the region."</p>

<p>In the meantime, rhubarb still has pride of place at Jewell Gardens. At their 2019 Summer Solstice and Rhubarb Festival, a thousand attendees stayed out in the Skagway sun late into the night. The Gardens handed out prizes for the largest locally grown rhubarb leaf and stalk (35 and 40.75 inches, respectively) and sold various rhubarb treats.

      <title>The Hidden History of a Missouri State Park </title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Ballwin, Missouri, a suburb to the southwest of St. Louis, is home to a nearly 2,000-acre public recreation area called Castlewood State Park. The park, which kisses the free-flowing Meramec River, was formally established in 1974. Since then, its trails have attracted bikers, hikers, and more.</p>
<p>But in the early 20th century, when the Missouri Pacific Railroad began shuttling city dwellers off to the great outdoors, Castlewood was a very different place. It was a bustling resort town.</p>
<p>“People lived in downtown St. Louis, and they got smokin’ hot during the summertime,” says Kevin Albrecht, deputy regional director of Missouri State Parks. “They had the rail, so people would hop on the train to [go] cool off in the river.”</p>
<p>Recently, a visitor at Castlewood stumbled upon a <a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/curious-louis-answers-does-castlewood-state-park-have-hidden-history#stream/0">staircase to nowhere</a>, obscured by nature and time. Now that discovery is prompting a deep dive into the history of the area and its early years as a summertime social setting, long before it became one of Missouri’s several state parks (after a conservation group called the Open Space Council of St. Louis encouraged the state of Missouri to take over the land).</p>
<p>The Castlewood resort was open from roughly 1915 to 1940, but its heyday as a vacation getaway was the 1920s. “Local people who lived in the area—west St. Louis County—probably got there by foot or bike or car,” says Albrecht. “But the lion’s share of [people coming out] these weekends were coming from [the city] ... They had special cars made so that you could bring your canoe on the train … [you could] hang it up and bring it to Castlewood.”</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67061/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Up until World War II, thousands of families used the Castlewood depot, especially on hot weekends. It was their gateway to summer recreation—swimming in the river, dancing in one of the seasonal clubs, ferrying to the popular Lincoln Beach sandbar.</p>
<p>The walls of the park office today are lined with old photographs donated by locals whose parents and grandparents vacationed at Castlewood, and who have worked to preserve a bit of the site’s lost history. Newspaper clippings advertise the popular Lincoln Lodge. Personal photographs illustrate the roughly 10,000 visitors that Castlewood received each weekend, including an aerial shot that Albrecht says shows “people by the hundreds.”</p>
<p>But by the middle of the century—after the advent of <a href="https://mostateparks.com/page/54950/general-information">air conditioning </a>made it more appealing to spend summers in urban areas—tourism at the riverside resort destination waned.</p>
<p>“Tastes changed back then,” says Albrecht, “but probably the biggest single factor [was] the automobile. When you think about the time frame, [not] that many people had automobiles ... but by the time you get back from World War II, the housing boom happens and then everyone has a car, so people started going other places.”</p>
<p>Today, the history of Castlewood as a summer hotspot is largely grown over. Most of the man-made buildings here, and the man-made beach, have been erased by decades of frequent river flooding.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/67060/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>“Over time natural deterioration took over,” says Albrecht. “Castlewood is one of five parks on the Meramec River … people started selling and abandoning properties, so a lot of it has just gone away with time and flooding.”</p>
<p>Yet the grand staircase, a concrete crescendo that runs from the bottomlands up toward the limestone bluff, still remains. Another wooden staircase, which once led vacationers from the train depot to their hotels, now takes explorers 250 feet above the river to a hiking trail. These steps have been maintained because the public still uses them, says Albrecht.</p>
<p>They also offer a hidden route for the sharp-eyed visitor: “There’s a pedestrian tunnel that goes under the railroad to the bottom of the staircase, and then you can walk up to the bluffs.”</p>
<p>Ruins of a few other buildings remain as well.</p>
<p>“There are two concrete foundations that exist,” says Albrecht. “Within the park itself, if you go down off of [a trail] alongside the river, there are concrete foundations up in the tree line [of the woods].”</p>
<p>These foundations may have belonged to one of Castlewood’s former dance halls or general stores. For years, one of the resort’s old wooden cabins was used as the on-site residence of the park superintendent. But six years ago, says Albrecht, after several failed attempts to renovate it, the structure was demolished.</p>
<p>Vestiges of the Lone Wolf Club, a Prohibition-era speakeasy open only to private members, can still be seen as well. Its stone wall and archway, which helped conceal illegal drinking in the 1920s, are on the grounds of Ballwin’s neighboring Wildlife Rescue Center. In fact, says Albrecht, “the ruins of the Lone Wolf Lodge may well be the best preserved piece [of old Castlewood] that remains.”</p>
<p>Since the resort stopped welcoming hot visitors in the 1940s, various campaigns to restore it to its former glory have surfaced. But none has come to fruition. It seems likely none ever will.</p>
<p>At least one thing hasn’t completely changed. The Missouri Pacific Railroad, which once ushered guests out to the Meramec River, still runs past the wood. Only now it’s called the Union Pacific.</p>]]>

First, there are the semi-precious stones that adorn the Taj Mahal: jade, onyx, and lapis lazuli forming the petals of glowing inlaid flowers climbing up the snow-white monument's marble surface. Then, there's an edible treasure: The luminous, translucent jewels of <em>Agra ka petha</em>, glowing green, saffron, and white from behind candy-counter glass.</p>
<p>Made of a candied local gourd, petha is said to have been invented by the ever-creative chefs of the Mughal royal court. Today, it's the signature sweet of North India's signature tourist town, but it's also seen its fair share of controversy, as local producers and the government face off over pollution standards. </p>
<p>Petha is made from the ash gourd (also known as the white pumpkin), a crop with pale-green skin and white, heavily-seeded, savory flesh. Candy makers cut the gourd into bite-size chunks and then cure it in a solution of lime (not the citrus; this is <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/recipe-petha-218806">white calcium hydroxide</a>) for a few hours. After draining the gourd pieces from the lime solution, they boil them until tender, finally soaking them in a flavored syrup. The resulting candy has a chewy, crystallized texture with an almost wet, sticky inside and a sugar-crisp exterior. Agra's sweet makers have been known to get creative with the flavoring, and candy counters in the city are rainbows of brightly-dyed petha flavored with everything from <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/paan-india"><em>paan</em></a> to rose.</p>
<p>Agra was the seat of the mighty Mughal Empire under Shah Jahan, the king who <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/252/">commissioned the Taj Mahal in 1631</a> in honor of his wife Mumtaz, who died while bearing the couple's 14th child. Shah Jahan's culinary tastes were legendarily sophisticated, and his royal chefs are attributed with creating some of North India's richest dishes and most inventive sweets, including Agra ka petha. As the story goes, Shah Jahan ordered his chefs to create a treat that would be <a href="https://www.thebetterindia.com/129745/food-history-indian-sweets-mysore-pak-agra-petha/">as pure as the Taj itself,</a> and petha was the result. </p>
<p>Today, the battle of the pethas is ongoing in Agra, where countless small manufacturers turn out versions of the sweet to feed the flow of tourists that come every year to see the Taj. The city’s signature candy became a source of controversy in 2014, when the government declared an 80-kilometer (50-mile) radius around the Taj Mahal the “Taj Trapezium Zone,” and banned the use of coal-powered manufacturing. The law was meant to protect the white marble of the Taj, which easily becomes grimy from air pollution, but local petha manufacturers, may of whom use coal to boil their sugar syrup, protested that the law hurt their businesses. “Petha is being made in the same old style since decades,” one small-scale petha manufacturer told <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/Petha-industry-not-harming-Taj-Kalraj/articleshow/41368950.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst">the <em>Times of India</em></a>. “This shows that the Taj is not turning black because of us. Still, it is only the poor who are being targeted.” The conflict is ongoing, with petha manufacturers abandoning the Noori Darwaza locality <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/agra-s-petha-industry-faces-tough-time-due-to-new-pollution-norms-1258781-2018-06-12">that was their traditional home</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the controversy, visitors to Agra can continue to find the treat overflowing in glowing rows in the sweetshops on the busy tourist drag leading up to the Taj's entrance. Feel free to indulge, but know that petha is not a sweet for the faint of heart. So sugary two bites can make your teeth hurt, Agra ka petha may be made by humble local producers, but it's a sweet fit for a queen.</p>]]>
