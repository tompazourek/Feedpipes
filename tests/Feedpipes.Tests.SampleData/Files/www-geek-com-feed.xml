				<p>Things are heating up in space: The Hubble Space Telescope recently spotted WASP-121b, a &#8220;heavy metal&#8221; <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/nasas-tess-mission-discovers-three-new-planets-including-oven-hot-world-and-mini-neptunes-1797921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exoplanet</a> that is shaped like a football and is more than 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>WASP-121b doesn&#8217;t emit loud electric guitar riffs, however, iron and magnesium gas, also known as &#8220;heavy metals,&#8221; are escaping the exoplanet and are heavier than lightweight hydrogen and helium. Hubble&#8217;s observations of WASP-121b demonstrate the first time heavy metal gas has been detected floating away from an exoplanet, <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2019/news-2019-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA said in a press release</a>. Hubble&#8217;s WASP-121b observation results are detailed in a study in the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab2986" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Astronomical Journal</em></a>, which was published on Aug. 1.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.geek.com/news/watch-animated-nasa-video-maps-4000-exoplanets-in-deep-space-1795367/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hot Jupiter-sized planets</a> are typically still cool enough inside to condense iron and magnesium into clouds, however, WASP-121b is a different case. The exoplanet is &#8220;hotter than hot&#8221; due to these heavy metals leaving its atmosphere, instead of condensing into clouds.</p>
<p>WASP-121b, which is roughly 900 light-years away from Earth, orbits close to a star that&#8217;s much warmer than the sun. Intense radiation heats the exoplanet&#8217;s upper atmosphere to a scorching 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists say the lower atmosphere is still hot enough that iron and magnesium stay in gaseous form and stream to the upper atmosphere, where they escape on the coattails of hydrogen and helium gas.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Earth’s sizzling temperatures this summer are no match for the superhot exoplanet WASP-121b. The alien world is so hot that iron and magnesium are escaping its atmosphere as superheated vapor, which has never been detected before: <a href="https://t.co/mmcuodmDK2">https://t.co/mmcuodmDK2</a> <a href="https://t.co/CElbmJXicE">pic.twitter.com/CElbmJXicE</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to NASA, researchers used the observatory&#8217;s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to search in ultraviolet light for the spectral signatures of magnesium and iron imprinted on starlight filtering through WASP-121b&#8217;s atmosphere while the exoplanet moved in front of the face of its home star. This helped them study how heavy metals escaped the exoplanet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NUV (2000-3000Å) is a region of the electromagnetic spectrum we don&#8217;t have too much data on exoplanets for, but it&#8217;s rich in atomic transitions, so there&#8217;s lots of fun elements to be detected. We looked at the incomparable WASP-121b and found this <a href="https://t.co/7mzqZpI4bE">pic.twitter.com/7mzqZpI4bE</a></p>
<p>— David Sing (@ExoSing) <a href="https://twitter.com/ExoSing/status/1156935884173955073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;Heavy metals have been seen in other hot Jupiters before, but only in the lower atmosphere,&#8221; lead researcher David Sing of Johns Hopkins University explained in the press release. &#8220;So you don&#8217;t know if they are escaping or not. With WASP-121b, we see magnesium and iron gas so far away from the planet that they&#8217;re not gravitationally bound.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exoplanet is located so close to its star that it is on the cusp of being broken apart by the star&#8217;s gravity, and this close proximity causes WASP-121b to have a football-like shape due to gravitational tidal forces.</p>
<p>Hubble&#8217;s WASP-121b observations could contribute more information on how planets lose their primordial atmospheres. When planets develop, they collect an atmosphere that contains gas from the <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/migrating-exoplanet-sculpts-disk-around-young-star-in-radiant-photo-1792284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disk</a> in which the planet and the star were made. These bizarre atmospheres mostly contain lighter-weight gases hydrogen and helium and they break apart as the planet moves in close proximity to its star.</p>
<p>The WASP-121b study above is part of the Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet Treasury (PanCET) survey, a large-scale Hubble Space Telescope program to study 20 exoplanets that range in size from Jupiters to super-Earths.</p>

				<p>A Cape Cod beach was closed on Wednesday after onlookers spotted a white <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/watch-mako-shark-does-backflips-stuns-onlookers-1798275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shark</a> and a new aerial photo shows the predator swimming right near the shore.</p>
<p>The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy&#8217;s spotter pilot, Wayne Davis, observed the shark lurking in the water off Newcomb Hollow Beach in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2019/08/01/photo-shark-newcomb-hollow-beach-wellfleet-cape-cod" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston.com reported</a>. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/atlanticwhiteshark/posts/2387938824620752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photo</a>, which was shared on Facebook by the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, shows the white shark in close proximity to the beach after beachgoers were ordered to get out of the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;August to October are peak months of white shark activity off Cape Cod,&#8221; the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy wrote on Facebook. &#8220;Whether or not a sighting is reported, we advise caution and recommend not venturing beyond waist-deep water.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second day in a row that Newcomb Hollow Beach was closed due to shark sightings, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/07/31/newcomb-hollow-beach-closed-for-second-day-row-due-shark-sightings/sdB6i7ysL41AwxrwwLFG2N/story.html?_sp=6c4c0aa5-e898-46e8-8fe2-acb4c84547d6.1564685230586" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Boston Globe</em> noted</a>. On Tuesday afternoon, a state police helicopter noticed a white shark hiding near swimmers in the water, prompting officials to temporarily prohibit people from going in the water.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s shark sighting follows <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/watch-leaping-great-white-shark-snatches-fish-from-line-stuns-family-on-boat-off-cape-cod-1796785/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a viral shark video captured off the coast of Cape Cod</a> last week, which showed a great white shark snatching a fishing line off a boat. A young boy who was with his family at the time was freaked out, since the massive animal came in close proximity to the vessel.</p>

				<p>You could say this news is jaw-dropping. In a rare surgery, doctors in India removed 526 teeth from the mouth of a 7-year-old boy, who came in complaining of jaw pain.</p>
<p>The boy was admitted last month at Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, in the southern city of Chennai, because of swelling and pain near his molars in his lower right jaw, doctors said.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncLfu_BjVRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>His parents said he had experienced the swelling since he was 3, but when the conditioned worsened, he was brought to the hospital, Dr. P. Senthilnathan, professor at the dental college&#8217;s Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, and one of two surgeons who operated on the boy, <a href="https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/chennai-doctors-extract-526-teeth-from-7-year-olds-mouth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told India&#8217;s <em>National Herald</em></a>.</p>
<p>Doctors scanned and x-rayed the boy&#8217;s mouth and found a sac embedded in his lower jaw. They performed surgery to remove the sac, which involved drilling into the jaw. Doctors said the sac itself weighed 200 grams.</p>
<p>After emptying the sac to confirm its contents, doctors discovered hundreds of teeth, all of different sizes. Some of the teeth were reported to be one-tenth of a millimeter, while others were up to 15mm. However, all had the properties of teeth, with a crown and a molar.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tamil Nadu: 526 teeth were removed from the lower jaw of a 7-year-old boy at a hospital in Chennai. Dr Senthilnathan says, &#8220;A 4&#215;3 cm tumour was removed from the lower right side of his jaw, after that, we came to know that 526 teeth were present there.&#8221; <a href="https://t.co/yBGohNBa7r">pic.twitter.com/yBGohNBa7r</a></p>
<p>— ANI (@ANI) <a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1156566758565826564?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It took doctors up to five hours to remove all the teeth from the sac, Senthilnathan told the <em>National Herald</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was reminiscent of pearls in an oyster,&#8221; the doctors said.</p>
<p>The boy, named Ravindranath, was released three days after the surgery and is expected to make a full recovery — with a healthy count of 21 teeth.</p>

				<p>If you know about any online video game streamers, it’s probably Ninja. With his colorful hair and skill in games like <em>Halo </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>, Tyler “Ninja” Blevins is one of the most successful people who films themselves playing video games for a living. And he’s found much of that success on Twitch.tv, the most popular place for streaming video games.</p>
<p>But other companies are trying take Twitch down, most notably Microsoft. Over the past few years the technology giant has been building up Mixer, its own streaming platform that has gotten pretty impressive with <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/microsofts-mixer-turns-streaming-into-its-own-video-game-1781222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nifty new community features</a> and <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/inside-microsofts-mixer-nyc-game-streaming-studio-1715683/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swanky New York City esports arenas</a>. But what good is a streaming platform without an audience?</p>
<p>So in a bombshell bit on news, drama on par with a free agent committing to carry a new team, Ninja has announced that he’s leaving Twitch to return to his roots and <a href="https://mixer.com/Ninja" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stream full-time on Mixer</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The next chapter,<a href="https://t.co/lvn9KBjEYq">https://t.co/lvn9KBjEYq</a> <a href="https://t.co/tljVgyM3bG">pic.twitter.com/tljVgyM3bG</a></p>
<p>— Ninja (@Ninja) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ninja/status/1156970023421915136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>There are times when Microsoft just reminds you how much money they have. They can get away with recalling billions of dollars worth of broken Xbox 360s. They can shrug off the disappointment of Xbox One sales. And they can pay Ninja what has to be an absurd fee to leave his Twitch home behind for the unproven waters of Mixer. Whatever they’re paying him though is probably worth it as Ninja bringing his fanbase to Mixer will raise the platform’s profile tremendously. It’s like launching the first Xbox with <em>Halo</em>.</p>
<p>“I never would have thought that I could build a career by doing what I love, and I am extremely grateful for the incredible experiences that I have had,” Blevins said in a statement. “As I look at the next step in my career, achieving bigger goals in the gaming industry with Mixer will allow me to have the perfect balance of opportunities and success.”</p>
<p>Ninja makes his debut on Mixer August 2 during Lollapalooza for some Red Bull thing. You can also look out for his upcoming book <em>Get Good: My Ultimate Guide to Gaming</em> coming August 20. Maybe it&#8217;ll help you compete in the next <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/fortnite-world-champion-teen-made-more-money-than-all-of-us-1797918/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite World Cup</a> that Ninja didn&#8217;t even qualify for. And while he’s in the mood for change, maybe Ninja will start streaming with women?</p>

				<p>A massive <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/dont-worry-an-asteroid-wont-collide-with-earth-this-year-1796131/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asteroid</a> larger than the Empire State Building is expected to safely fly by Earth on Aug. 10, according to NASA.</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) is monitoring <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2006%20QQ23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2006 QQ23</a>, a giant space rock that measures up to 1,870 feet in diameter and is slightly bigger than the tall New York City-based structure (1,454 feet), <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2006-qq23-enormous-asteroid-empire-state-building-earth-1451864" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Newsweek</em> reported</a>. On Aug. 10, at 3:23 a.m. EST, 2006 QQ23 is expected to come within approximately 4.55 million miles of our planet as it safely cruises by at a speed of 10,400 mph, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/31/empire-state-building-sized-asteroid-expected-to-miss-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Post</em> noted</a>.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_eEXScLFBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>According to NASA, 2006 QQ23 is classified as a Near-Earth Object (NEO), which is an asteroid or comet with an orbit that takes it within roughly 30 million miles of Earth. CNEOS tracks NEOs&#8217; orbits to see if they have a chance of hitting our planet in the future. Any NEO that approaches Earth closer than 0.05 &#8220;astronomical units,&#8221; which is about 4.65 million miles, is considered as a &#8220;potentially hazardous&#8221; object by CNEOS.</p>
<p>CNEOS is still keeping an eye on 2006 QQ23 and other NEOs at the moment, however, the chance of one of these <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/japans-hayabusa-2-collects-second-sample-from-asteroid-ryugu-1795270/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space rocks</a> striking our planet is very slim.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XVdmGAFaFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There are some asteroids that have an exceedingly small chance of impacting Earth over the next couple [of] centuries. Asteroid Bennu, which is currently being visited by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, currently has a one-in-a-few-thousand chance of impacting a couple of centuries from now, but as we continue to track this asteroid, I expect that chance to drop to zero,&#8221; CNEOS Manager Paul Chodas told <em>Newsweek.</em> &#8220;None of the other known asteroids has a significant chance of impacting Earth over the next century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asteroid 2006 QQ23 also has company: Last month, <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/nasa-3-enormous-asteroids-flew-very-close-to-earth-on-july-24-1797306/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three large asteroids zoomed by Earth on July 24</a>, however, NASA did not consider them to be threatening objects. Asteroid 2019 OD, Asteroid 2019 OE, and Asteroid 2015 HM10 had some interesting characteristics—two were roughly the same size as one of the famous Giza pyramids in Egypt, while the other was less than 175 feet in diameter.</p>

				<p>This week sees the release of an indie title we&#8217;ve been excited about for some time, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-church-in-the-darkness-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Church In The Darkness</em></a>, which lets you infiltrate a Jonestown-esque cult compound and try to save your brainwashed nephew while not getting found out and forced to drink some special Kool-Aid. Cults have been a popular choice for video game antagonists for decades, from role-playing to all-out action, but not all cults are created equal. In this feature we spotlight ten made-up religions that really push the evil.</p>
<h2>The Healing Church</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1798138" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healing-church-625x351.jpg" alt="The Healing Church" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healing-church.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healing-church-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healing-church-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/healing-church-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bloodborne-PlayStation-4/dp/B00KVR4HEC/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Software&#8217;s <em>Bloodborne</em></a> takes place in a terrifying, decaying Victorian city called Yharnam that is infested with corrupted humans and eldritch beasts that will kill you faster than you can scream. Why is that? Thank the Healing Church, who discovered the hidden Pthumerian blood in tombs beneath the city and experimented with it, resulting in the entire population becoming addicted. They claimed the blood had healing properties, luring the sick and infirm to Yharnam. Things got so terrible there that the whole city was quarantined in a dream realm to keep the Old Ones awakened by the blood from destroying the world.</p>

<h2>Unitology</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1798142" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/unitology-625x351.jpg" alt="Unitology" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/unitology.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/unitology-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/unitology-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/unitology-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>Many religions start as an attempt to find meaning in the unknown, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Space-Xbox-360/dp/B001U0CMUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dead Space</em></a><em>&#8216;s </em>Unitology is no different. In the world of the gory limb-severing video game, the crash at the Chicxulub crater brought the first sign of the Markers to Earth, and although most of the scientists at the site were driven to madness, one man, Michael Altman, was able to resist. He was murdered for his troubles and dubbed the &#8220;Reluctant Prophet&#8221; by the group that would soon be called Unitologists. The cult believes that all life is prologue for the &#8220;convergence&#8221; that happens after death, when human corpses transform into ravaging Necromorphs, and their end goal is to convince all of humanity to commit suicide and be reborn.</p>

<h2>Children Of Atom</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1798144" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children-625x351.jpg" alt="Children Of Atom" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/children-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>Cults thrive after tragedy, so it&#8217;s not surprising that the post-apocalyptic world of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Game-Year-Classic-Xbox-360/dp/B0087BTIKC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fallout 3</em> </a>has some religious wingnuts. The Children of Atom, who you first meet in the ramshackle hamlet of Megaton, have built a whole belief system around the nuclear destruction that ravaged the Earth. In their doctrine, every time a nuke is detonated it creates an entire new universe, and the lingering fallout isn&#8217;t cancer &#8211; it&#8217;s &#8220;The Glow.&#8221; Members seek out heavily irradiated areas to build shrines to their deity, and stockpile and protect unexploded bombs to usher in even more glorious creation.</p>

<h2>The Order</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1798146" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/order-625x351.jpg" alt="The Order" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/order.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/order-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/order-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/order-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>There are few things in the gaming world that make us sadder than Konami keeping the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Hill-HD-Collection-Playstation-3/dp/B0050SXAIG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Silent Hill</em></a> series in limbo. It&#8217;s one of the survival horror genre&#8217;s keystones and the mythos behind the isolation and fear is top notch. Case in point: the Order, the malevolent cult behind so much of the series&#8217; bad times. Founded in the early days of the American colonies, in the 1800s a quartet of pioneers entered a contract with a dark god from the Otherworld to overturn human civilization and create a new world &#8220;free of sin.&#8221; Over the years, the Order has splintered into numerous sects, each of with is creepy and abusive in its own way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Hill-HD-Collection-Playstation-3/dp/B0050SXAIG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Silent Hill at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Los Illuminados</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1798147" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/illuminados-625x351.jpg" alt="Los Illuminados" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/illuminados.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/illuminados-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/illuminados-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/illuminados-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-PlayStation-Standard/dp/B01CR05F5K/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a> was a major turning point from the series, as Capcom moved away both from the slow-paced mounting terror of previous games as well as the long-running adversary in the Umbrella Corporation. When Leon Kennedy gets dropped into the mountains of Spain, he mets the Illuminados, the descendents of an ancient pagan group that believed forcible implantation with the Plagas parasites was the one true path to enlightenment. Led by Osmund Saddler, the group planned to kidnap the President&#8217;s daughter and infect her as a vector to seize control of the United States government and, eventually, the world. Having literal mind control parasites definitely gives them a leg up in the brainwashing game.</p>

<h2>Cult Of Kefka</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1798148" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kefka-625x351.jpg" alt="Cult Of Kefka" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kefka.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kefka-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kefka-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kefka-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>After the malevolent jester ushers in the World of Ruin in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Anthology-PlayStation/dp/B00002R28C/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></a>, the few survivors realize that Kefka has enough power to mess them up whenever they want so they decide to form a quasi-religious organization to worship him and hopefully keep his ego satisfied. The Cult operate out of a tower in the Serpent Trench that their leader has enchanted to forbid the usage of physical attacks within (unless you&#8217;re smart and bring Umaro), and at the top is the priceless Soul of Thamasa that lets a magic-user cast spells twice in a round. The Cult are so single-mindedly devoted to their evil master that they ignore all communication from outsiders, but rumor has it they can be raised from their trance if somebody closely related calls out to them.</p>

<h2>The Mythic Dawn</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1798234" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mythic-dawn-625x351.jpg" alt="The Mythic Dawn" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mythic-dawn.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mythic-dawn-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mythic-dawn-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mythic-dawn-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p>A popular use for cults in gaming is to provide underlings for the player to smash through on their way to the Big Boss, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elder-Scrolls-IV-Playstation-sony-playstation3/dp/B000TVT7U4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Oblivion</em></a>&#8216;s Mythic Dawn are a classic example. Formed to worship the demonic Mehrunes Dragon, their end goal is to bring down the sorcerous barriers that insulate Tamriel from Oblivion and let the Daedra run rampant over the land. What the point of enslaving the whole planet isn&#8217;t made clear, but this is one of the few cults on this list that you have the option of joining, but if you don&#8217;t eventually betray them you can&#8217;t, you know, finish the game. If that&#8217;s important to you.</p>

<h2>The Order Of The Harvest Moon</h2>

<p>1996 cult classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harvester-pc/dp/B0007Z1IEA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Harvester</em></a> is one of the goriest and most disturbing point-and-click adventures ever made. In it, you play an amnesiac man who wakes up in a small town and is told that all of his questions will be answered if he joins the Order of the Harvest Moon. The path to do so takes him through a series of increasingly illegal and amoral initiations. Once you&#8217;re in, you learn that the Order is actually an evil murder cult with a very terrifying mission: to transform you, the player of the game, into a serial killer by desensitizing you to brutality, pain and violence. The complicity you play in the cult&#8217;s actions is the big reason why they land in such a sweet spot on this list.</p>

<h2>The Oro</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Condemned-Criminal-Origins-Xbox-360/dp/B0009SQFHA/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Condemned</em></a> games start out pretty down to earth, with the player controlling Ethan Thomas, a FBI crime scene investigator on the hunt for a mysterious serial killer. As you progress, though, it becomes apparent that this is more than a lone nut — in fact, Metro City is under siege by a group called the Oro, an ancient cult of mutated humans who are born with an alteration of their vocal chords. Aided by metal implants, they can use their voices to plant suggestions in people&#8217;s minds and even cause physical harm. Ethan tracks the group to their lair and manages to destroy it, but in a final cutscene it&#8217;s heavily hinted that the tendrils of the Oro reach all the way up to the President of the United States.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outlast-Trinity-PS4-playstation-4/dp/B06XHDNX5S/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Outlast</em> </a>series is one of the shining lights in horror games right now, as they perfectly capture the feeling of helplessness and dread necessary to inspire true terror. The second game in the series puts you in the shoes of a cameraman investigating the murder of a young woman in Arizona, only to discover that the whole town of Temple Gate has been taken over by a violent, apocalyptic cult led by a man named &#8220;Papa&#8221; Sullivan Knoth. Knoth believes that your wife is pregnant with the Antichrist and pursues you in a nerve-wracking adventure that features tons of atrocity. The madness is eventually traced to a chemical leak that has driven the populace mad, but by that point it&#8217;s already too late.</p>

				<p>Daenerys Targaryen&#8217;s death was one of the most intense moments in the <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/hbo-responds-to-viral-game-of-thrones-season-8-remake-petition-1797725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Game of Thrones</em> finale</a>. Even though the series is over, some fans are still wondering why Drogon torched the Iron Throne instead of Jon Snow. After receiving an <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/game-of-thrones-stars-share-emotional-emmy-nomination-reactions-1796172/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emmy nomination</a> for the writing of <em>Game of Thrones&#8217;</em> finale, <a href="https://www.emmys.com/sites/default/files/collateral/Game%20of%20Thrones%20-%20Ep%20806%20-%20The%20Iron%20Throne%20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HBO released the episode&#8217;s entire script online</a> and it shows some shocking details about the unforgettable scene.</p>
<p>Drogon, one of Daenerys Targaryen&#8217;s dragons, always protected her throughout the series, <a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/08/01/game-of-thrones-finale-script-drogon-iron-throne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook.com noted</a>. Considering Jon Snow killed the Mother of Dragons, it wouldn&#8217;t have been shocking if Drogon lit him on fire instead of the Iron Throne. However, this didn&#8217;t happen, leading some viewers to believe that the <em>Game of Thrones</em> showrunners had a more meaningful reason for not pursuing that scenario, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/game-of-thrones-finale-script-explains-why-drogon-destroys-the-iron-throne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET reported</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1798411" style="max-width: 836px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-1798411" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoTScript73119.jpg" alt="" width="826" height="478" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoTScript73119.jpg 826w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoTScript73119-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoTScript73119-625x362.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoTScript73119-768x444.jpg 768w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoTScript73119-650x376.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Credit: HBO</p></div>
<p>According to the episode&#8217;s script, the Iron Throne was just &#8220;a dumb bystander&#8221; in the way of Drogon&#8217;s fiery path. Drogon reportedly wanted to &#8220;burn the world&#8221; and there&#8217;s no explanation provided for why he didn&#8217;t kill Jon Snow in the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drogon wants to burn the world, but he will not burn Jon [Snow],&#8221; said the script. &#8220;We look over Jon&#8217;s shoulder as the fire sweeps toward the throne—not the target of Drogon&#8217;s wrath, just a dumb bystander caught up in the conflagration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another major plot puzzle was also disclosed and it hinted that there wouldn&#8217;t be someone sitting in the biggest power seat of Westeros.</p>
<p>The showrunners said, &#8220;Who will sit on the Iron Throne? No one.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right. Not a single soul. So any fan who was hoping that it would be Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, or a Lannister, had their hopes shattered right there.</p>

				<p>EVO, the premier fighting game tournament, is this weekend. So get ready to see lots of colorful characters, both in the games and in real-life in the case of <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/what-sonicfoxs-evo-win-means-for-geek-culture-1748331/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SonicFox</a>, go at it in a <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/watch-these-fighting-games-at-evo-2019-1776376/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lineup</a> featuring the newest and best games in the genre. With so much glory (and money) on the line, lots of folks will be tuning in online or even on ESPN2. So naturally game publishers are eager to hype up this showcase of their products.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to build hype at EVO is to announce a new character for your fighting game. Cool characters are the lifeblood of fighting games, and new characters can change everything players think they know about the competitive scene they know and love. Nintendo already got ahead of this by just releasing <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/the-ultimate-super-smash-bros-character-guide-hero-1798010/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hero from <em>Dragon Quest</em></a> as a bonkers new DLC character for <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,</em> the biggest game at the show. But two other huge fighting games, <em>Street Fighter V and Mortal Kombat 11</em>, have just revealed new characters as well.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1jphoFlKEBM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>After these characters were first leaked, Capcom confirmed the latest additions to <em>Street Fighter V</em>, characters that will be available during the tournament itself. First, E. Honda finally joined the roster. The sumo wrestler was the only character from the classic <em>Street Fighter 2</em> cast still missing so it’s about time. Meanwhile, the <em>Street Fighter/Final Fight</em> relationship got even more incestuous with two more characters Metro City. Sadistic Mad Gear gangster Poison returns with her whips. Opposing her is police officer Lucia with her Harley Quinn accent and Sonya Blade tactics.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pi0Gi6lDo6c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, we also already know about many of the characters coming soon to <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> like Sindel and Spawn as well as rumored characters like Ash, The Joker, and The Terminator. However, NetherRealm just dropped the first gameplay trailer for Nightwolf, debuting in early access August 13. This Native American warrior returns from <em>Mortal Kombat 3</em>. He uses a variety of spiritual powers drawn from bears and wolves as well perfectly fine weapons like axes and bows. Time for some payback.</p>

				<p>With anime series such as <em>Castlevania</em>, <em>SAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,</em> and <em>Kengang Ashura </em><a href="https://www.geek.com/anime/best-new-anime-to-stream-on-netflix-in-2019-1785183/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently available on Netflix</a>, the streaming giant has been helping boost the genre&#8217;s popularity among the binge-watching crowd.

<p>The documentary will spotlight Netflix’s original and licensed anime content (of course) including <em>Castlevania</em>, <em>Aggretsuko</em>, <em>Kengan Ashura, </em>feature interviews with anime giants such as Kozo Morishita (<em>Saint Seiya</em>), Yoko Takahashi (<em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>), and Shinji Aramaki (<em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>).</p>
<p>Netflix has stacked its 2019 slate with several new and returning anime series. In March, the service announced several, new partnerships with Japanese production companies so fans can expect more anime to stream.</p>
<p>The much-anticipated sequel to the acclaimed <em>Ghost in the Shell SAC</em> series, <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045</em>; and the crime thriller <em>Super Crooks</em>, by Mark Millar and artist Leinil Francis Yu, the creators of <em>Kick Ass</em> and <em>Wanted</em>, won’t be streaming until 2020, but fans can already (or will soon) find <em>Carole &amp; Tuesday</em>, <em>Forest of Piano &#8211; Season 2</em>, and <em>Levius</em> on Netflix.</p>

				<p>Likability is no substitute for understandability when it comes to crafting character. So often it feels that film discourse mistakes the former for the latter and disregards the latter when the former is present. It feels like once or twice a month Film And TV Twitter will lobby the same criticism at a new blockbuster or the returning season of a TV show, that being that, “______ was so unlikable!” as though it’s a failure on the part of the writers. Very rarely is it considered that the idea that the unlikability they’re referencing is intentional.</p>
<p>Likability is overrated. I don’t need to like a character to understand them, and personally I find that I’m actually far more prone to like a character — even if they’re acting a damn fool — if I can understand why they’re acting a damn fool. When I blew through <a href="https://www.geek.com/tag/stranger-things-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Stranger Things 3</em></a> last week it never bothered me that Hopper and Joyce were acting like a couple of dumbasses throughout those eight episodes because it seemed abundantly clear to me not only that I was supposed to notice that they were acting like a couple of dumbasses, but also why they were acting like a couple of dumbasses. Their behavior tracked with my understanding of who these people are three seasons into this show and, as a result, not only was I not annoyed by the constant bickering; I was pretty actively amused by it.</p>
<p>Anyways, 10 minutes into <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/29335-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Criterion’s beautiful restoration</a> of Alexander Payne’s 1999 high school movie/political dramedy <em>Election</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Election-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray-Broderick/dp/B075N573BF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see it on Amazon</a>) I realized every member of the core cast just totally sucks. Utter drags. Real garbage heap, scum of the earth, asslords of trash mountain types.</p>
<p>I hated them. But I also couldn’t help but love them.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBgM_Kw6PSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I hated Tracy Flick long before she revealed herself to be a Republican. Once a character singlehandedly defines an archetype it feels like there’s very little left for a writer to say about them but, oh man, there’s so much to say about Tracy Flick even if it’s all repetition.</p>
<p>Like, four line readings into her performance as Tracy you know exactly why Reese Witherspoon became one of the great performers of her generation. It’s actually wild to realize that Elle Woods of <em>Legally Blonde</em> actually happened after Tracy considering the ways in which Tracy feels like Elle’s Negaverse doppelganger. Tracy is all of the relentless determination and hard work that makes Elle such a vital role model almost two decades after she first graced screens without any of the warmth or compassion. In their place is a ruthlessness, a predatory cunning far more resembling a recurring character on <em>Veep</em> than a high school overachiever. I feel like a marker of a great character is if you react to them the same way the characters around them do and the moment when Tracy tells Matthew Broderick’s Mr. McAllister that she knows he’s failed in his efforts to conceive a child with his wife I made a face I can only describe as Just Saw The Red Wedding For The First Time-esque.</p>
<div id="attachment_1798324" style="max-width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1798324" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_broderick-625x351.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_broderick-625x352.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_broderick-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_broderick-650x366.jpg 650w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_broderick-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_broderick-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_broderick.jpg 690w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Matthew Broderick in &#8216;Election.&#8217; (Photo Credit: Paramount Pictures)</p></div>
<p>A character like Tracy would age far more poorly in a less thoughtful movie. The way she’s written deftly avoids the out-and-out misogyny that can come with painting ambitious women as evil harpies. <em>Election</em> instead gives you about 700 reasons to hate Tracy that are far more significant than the fact that she’s a know-it-all who feels that it’s her destiny to be class president. Her reaction to Chris Klein’s Paul entering the race as her primary competitor is actually pretty justified (Paul is a very amiable idiot, but more on him later) and likely resonates with any woman or POC who has had to watch an under-qualified white dude fail upwards. No, the real venom comes out in her reaction to Tammy entering the race.</p>
<p>Tammy’s entrance into the race is an act of aggression against her oblivious brother and when the time comes to give her campaign speech in front of the entire student body she, rather than offering reasons they should vote for her, denounces the very concept of student government as arcane and useless before encouraging students to not vote at all. She’s met with thunderous applause.</p>
<div id="attachment_1798325" style="max-width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1798325" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_pickflick-625x351.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="351" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_pickflick-625x352.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_pickflick-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_pickflick-650x366.jpg 650w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_pickflick-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_pickflick-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_pickflick.jpg 690w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(Photo Credit: Paramount Pictures)</p></div>
<p>Tracy, predictably, is outraged by this (she throws some nasty language Tammy’s way via internal monologue). However, it’s notable that Tracy is every bit part of the problem Tammy has pointed out. We never actually learn anything about Tracy’s policy or goals throughout her campaign. She’s a player in the theatre of politics and you can’t help but wonder if part of the reason she’s so eager to prove Tammy wrong is because she knows Tammy is right.</p>
<p>The other side of the Tracy coin is Broderick’s Mr. McAllister. Early on in the first act, he’s recounting Tracy’s affair with his best friend and fellow teacher Dave Novotny (oh, forgot to mention the part where Tracy had an affair with a teacher). Despite their friendship, McAllister professes that Dave is something of an overgrown man-child &#8211; hence the affair with a student. McAllister, in doing this, seems to look to distance himself from Dave’s immaturity and toxicity. He then spends the entire rest of the movie showing us just how similar the two of them are.</p>
<div id="attachment_1798327" style="max-width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-1798327" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_criterion.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="497" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_criterion.jpg 400w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/election_criterion-300x373.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(Photo Credit: Criterion Collection)</p></div>
<p>From his wholly inappropriate grudge against Tracy to the affair he instigates with Dave’s ex-wife, McAllister is a worm. The only difference between him and Dave is that McAllister is smart enough to put some effort into pretending he’s not. We know exactly who he is from his first scene in which he callously throws out his coworkers’ refrigerated lunches to make room for his own in the fridge (an event that proves his undoing, but I’ll avoid spoiling that for now).</p>
<p>That said, Tracy and McAllister’s imperfections, however egregious, are still grounded. They’re awful, yeah, but they’re realistically awful, so much so that some of the film’s inherent humor comes in the fact that we’ve all probably known — or at one point been — a Tracy or a Mr. McAllister. That they’re recognizably human stops us from tuning out of their story, if only so that we can see them get their eventual comeuppance.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYt6asKb5bw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Payne’s direction shows us just how repugnant McAllister and Tracy are early into the movie. The closest thing we have to likable characters are Paul and Tammy, both of whom are still rife with imperfection (Paul is the only legitimately good-hearted and well-intentioned character in the movie but he’s still an unqualified doofus who should recognize that he has no place in this presidential race). Our emotional tether is not meant to be a character but rather a vague semblance of justice, a world in which Tracy and McAllister get what they deserve.</p>
<p>And they do. The film’s closing scenes depict the rivals as having ended up in hells so quiet they hardly realize they aren’t in heaven.</p>
<p>Not every intentionally-unlikable character is going to be crafted with the same care Payne put into Tracy Flick and Mr. McAllister. Still, watching Election is a nice reminder that it’s far more important to understand a character than it is to like them.</p>

				<p>A team of ocean explorers using autonomous underwater robots has discovered the bow of the World War II submarine USS Grunion 77 years after the sub went missing near the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.</p>
<p>The submarine, which had a crew of 70 sailors, went missing about a month after it departed on its first war patrol in 1942. It wasn&#8217;t seen again until 2007, when its wreckage was found off the coast of the Aleutian Islands by the sons of the Grunion&#8217;s captain, Lieutenant Commander Mannert L. Abele.</p>
<p>But now, the bow of the submarine has been identified, completing a vital part of the puzzle and answering questions posed during the Abele brothers&#8217; expeditions to find it, according to Tim Taylor of the <a href="http://www.lost52project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost 52 Project</a>, which searches for sunken World War II submarines.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0C3mjTHsErQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I am honored to add to the discovery that was accomplished by the Abele bothers,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
<p>The bow was found in 2,713 feet of water near Kiska with a combination of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and advanced photogrammetry imaging, new technologies that are forging a new frontier in subsea exploration, according to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fourth-wwii-us-submarine-discovery-continues-lost-52-projects-mission-of-honoring-sailors-300892914.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>.</p>

<p>USS Grunion was a Gato-class submarine commissioned on April 11, 1942. On her way through the Caribbean to her first posting in Pearl Harbor, she rescued 16 survivors from USAT Jack, which had been torpedoed by a U-boat. But her first war patrol was, unfortunately, her last.</p>
<p>Sent to the Aleutian Islands in June 1942, she operated off Kiska, Alaska, where she sank two Japanese patrol boats. Ordered back to the naval operating base in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on July 30, the submarine was never heard from again. She was declared overdue from patrol and assumed lost with no survivors on October 5, 1942.</p>
<p>In October 2018, the Lost 52 Project team returned to the site of the main wreck and found that the ship&#8217;s bow had slid down a steep volcanic embankment, Taylor <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/world/ww2-submarine-uss-grunion-bow-discovered-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told CNN</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1798394" style="max-width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1798394" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ussgrunion_navy-625x486.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="486" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ussgrunion_navy-625x486.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ussgrunion_navy-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ussgrunion_navy-650x505.jpg 650w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ussgrunion_navy.jpg 690w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The USS Grunion in March 1942. (Photo Credit: US Navy photo, courtesy of Electric Boat Corporation &amp; ussubvetsofworldwarii.org)</p></div>
<p>The team put together a 3D scan of the bow and presented it to the Abele family. &#8220;When we brought it back to the family, it opened up so much more understanding of what happened and why it sank and what happened to the submarine,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
<p>The Lost 52 Project takes large data sets collected on their discoveries and process them into 3D archaeological photogrammetry models.</p>
<p>&#8220;This goes so far past video or still imagery, it truly is the future of recording historical underwater discoveries,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;Spending minimal time on site collecting a comprehensive 3D historical baseline model allows archaeologists and historians to spend months back home performing detailed research.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I have a lot of opinions about <em>The Room</em>. The so-called “<em>Citizen Kane</em> of Bad Movies” is indeed so awful that it’s absolutely hilarious. Every minute is packed with meme-worthy bits of bizarre incompetence as this weird vampire man stars in a glossy nonsensical romance drama. I love it, watching it alone or with a trained cult crowd in midnight theaters <em>Rocky Horror</em> style.</p>
<p>What I don’t love is <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/the-room-is-great-but-tommy-wiseau-sucks-1724807/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tommy Wiseau’s desperate attempt</a> to spin the whole thing as some kind of joke on purpose. I’m not laughing with Tommy, I’m laughing at him. What doesn’t help are all the accounts of Wiseau’s sketchy behavior detailed in <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/moviebob-reviews-the-disaster-artist-1724568/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Disaster Artist</em></a> (co-written by co-star Greg Sestero sadly accepting this is the height of his career). This book was then adapted into a pretty great drama by my personal irony king James Franco, just adding to my inner conflict.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s a video that imagines what it might be like if Tommy Wiseau entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBwq2PjlntQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Edited by Pistol Shrimps and Schomoyoho, this musical mashup inserts songified clips from <em>The Room</em> into various iconic Avengers moments. They even got Sestero to record some new footage, and plug his new movie with Wiseau <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/tommy-wiseau-and-greg-sestero-are-still-best-friends-1753547/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Best Friends</em></a>. This was actually first posted a few months ago, hence why there’s nothing here from <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. But Wiseau just posted it on his own YouTube page, renewing interest.</p>
<p>After SDCC, we already know about <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/marvel-studios-top-movie-announcements-from-sdcc-2019-1796724/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Studios Phase 4</a>. But would you want to see Marvel Studios’ <em>The Room</em> as part of Phase 5? It could work. Wiseau is already part of the Marvel universe in the comics. He’s an alien criminal who escaped the Guardians of the Galaxy and fled to Earth to make bad movies. James Gunn would have a field day with that.

<p>In the post, Clarke explained how the arachnid was roughly the &#8220;size of your hand&#8221; and how she didn&#8217;t have a container that would enable her to capture it.</p>
<p>“When I went near it with the phone light, it [came] at me raising it fangs and legs. Hell nahhhh!” Clarke wrote.</p>
<p>Members of the Facebook community had some suggestions for Clarke and they joked about the spider&#8217;s random visit to her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably easier to burn your house down at this point,&#8221; someone wrote in response to Clarke.</p>
<p>Another commented, &#8220;Jesus! Tell him to pay rent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later on, Clarke posted an update on the spider and said it was &#8220;safely removed&#8221; from her home.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California Santa Barbara is <a href="https://filamentpatent.ucsb.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing five major retailers</a> for the unauthorized distribution of light bulbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at the UC Santa Barbara spent years building a portfolio of patents that cover filament LED bulbs—those &#8220;vintage&#8221; lights reminiscent of Thomas Edison&#8217;s early designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Walmart, Target, IKEA, Amazon, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond went and filched them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LED filament light bulbs mimic the appearance of a standard bulb, but require less energy, create less heat, and distribute light in all directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since their introduction in 2014, the bulbs have grown in popularity, occupying hipster coffee shops and contemporary home decor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Retailers have been profiting from the unauthorized sales of this technology since it first became available, despite UC Santa Barbara&#8217;s efforts to notify infringers and establish licenses with companies in the lighting industry,&#8221; the school said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, there&#8217;s nothing left to do but sue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Barbara, led by the law office of Nixon Peabody LLP, is the first university to bring legal charges against an entire industry through retail sellers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The goal of this campaign is to ensure that UC&#8217;s patent rights are respected so it can reinvest in education and research to create more world-changing technologies,&#8221; Seth Levy, a partner at Nixon Peabody, said in <a href="https://www.nixonpeabody.com/news/press-releases/2019/07/30/np-team-representing-uc-in-groundbreaking-patent-enforcement-campaign-in-led-lighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It also is a message to entities throughout the private sector that university intellectual property rights cannot be infringed with impunity,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California Santa Barbara isn&#8217;t out for blood, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary, the university encourages retailers to sell filament LED light bulbs and continue to make the technology widely available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They just want credit where credit is due.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that sell the popular product &#8220;must respect UC Santa Barbara&#8217;s intellectual property rights, and receive authorization … in the form of a license.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university is now seeking royalties from all five defendants, the amount of which will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our hope is that these lawsuits demonstrate the importance of respecting the rights of university patent owners,&#8221; the institution said. &#8220;Companies must appreciate that, when selling technology patented by a university, it is their responsibility to do so only with the proper license agreement in place.&#8221;</span></p>

				<p>Go shopping for a smartphone today and you&#8217;ll have no shortage of options with huge touchscreens and virtually no touchscreens. It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that smartphone buyers flocked to a very different kind of device.</p>
<p>Like a lot of geeks, my first real smartphone was a BlackBerry. Years ago their square-screend QWERTY phones were everywhere, but then the iPhone and changed everything.</p>
<p>But no matter how smart autocomplete or swipe-style on-screen keyboards get there are still plenty of people out there who wish they had a physical keyboard on their phones to bang out email messages or status updates. Some of those people work at Unihertz, a company that is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-unihertz-rugged-qwerty-smartphone/description">crowdfunding a new QWERTY phone</a> called the Titan.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kiOPumgiRzU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The Titan is powered by a 2GHz MediaTek Helio P60 octa-core processor and packs 128GB of internal storage. Its 4.5-inch touchscreen has a native resolution of 1440 x 1440 pixels for a density of 452PPI.</p>
<p>It also has 16MP rear and 8MP front-facing cameras, dual SIM card slots, micro SD expansion, 802.11AC WiFi, Bluetooth 4.1, FM radio, and wireless charging.</p>
<p>The real star of the show is the physical keyboard. It&#8217;s very similar to the ones BlackBerry used to make. It&#8217;s backlit, touch sensitive (use it as a trackpad or swipe to type), and features an integrated fingerprint sensor.</p>
<div id="attachment_1798367" style="max-width: 635px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1798367" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniherztitan2-625x415.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="415" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniherztitan2-625x415.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniherztitan2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniherztitan2-650x431.jpg 650w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniherztitan2.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(Photo Credit: Uniherz Titan / Kickstarter)</p></div>
<p>While it&#8217;s sure to be a hit with BlackBerry devotees, <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/07/unihertz-titan-smartphone-hits-kickstarter-budget-blackberry-clone.html">the Titan has more in store</a> for the boss who wants to get things done on the go. Its 6000mAh battery offers up to 25 hours of Internet use or 42 hours of talk time.</p>
<p>And speaking of talk, there&#8217;s a PTT button on the side of the phone that lets you instantly chat with the rest of your team. Those who prefer action over talk can remap it to perform other functions.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed from its name, the Titan is also built to last. It&#8217;s waterproof, dust-proof, and shockproof.</p>
<p>Unihertz plans to sell the Titan for a very reasonable $359 once <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-unihertz-rugged-qwerty-smartphone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Kickstarter campaign</a> concludes. Early backers scored their phones for $100 less. While you can&#8217;t snap up a single Titan at that price any more you can still grab a two-pack for $478&#8230; which is still a heck of a lot less than you&#8217;d pay for most unlocked, all-touch smartphones.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence can predict a leading cause of preventable patient harm up to two days before it occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google&#8217;s DeepMind, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/predicting-patient-deterioration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed technology</a> that could give doctors a 48-hour head start in treating acute kidney injury (AKI).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The condition (previously known as acute renal failure) causes build-up of waste in the blood, making it hard for the kidneys to balance fluid; the result is often a sudden failure or damage that occurs over a few hours or a few days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affecting up to one in five hospitalized patients in the US and UK, AKI is notoriously difficult to spot, and deterioration can happen quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning to the rescue!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using anonymized health records from the VA network, DeepMind&#8217;s AI correctly predicted nine out of 10 patients whose condition deteriorated so severely they required dialysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This could provide a window in the future for earlier preventative treatment and avoid the need for more invasive procedures like kidney dialysis,&#8221; study co-authors Dominic King and Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a blog post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team hopes the model will one day be used to identify other major causes of disease and deterioration, including life-threatening infection sepsis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their research was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1390-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published this week</a> in the journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1798362" style="max-width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-1798362" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deepmind-1.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="388" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deepmind-1.jpg 690w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deepmind-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deepmind-1-625x352.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deepmind-1-650x366.jpg 650w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deepmind-1-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deepmind-1-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">DeepMind wants to use AI to give doctors a 48-hour head start on life-threatening illness (via DeepMind)</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is our team&#8217;s biggest healthcare research breakthrough to date, demonstrating the ability to not only spot deterioration more effectively, but actually predict it before it happens,&#8221; Suleyman and King said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology, however, won&#8217;t help anyone without the right tools to alert specialists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Better technology is desperately needed so that critical information can be delivered to the right specialist at the right time,&#8221; DeepMind said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter Streams, a mobile medical assistant for clinicians, which has been in use at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust since early 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app allows specialists to review urgent cases in 15 minutes or less—a process that might otherwise take several hours—and helps reduce the number of AKI cases missed at the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Getting the right information about the right patient at the right time is a huge problem for healthcare systems across the globe,&#8221; according to King and Suleyman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These results comprise the building blocks for our long-term vision of preventative healthcare, helping doctors to intervene in a proactive, rather than reactive, manner,&#8221; they added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research, led by David Feinberg, will continue as part of Google Health.</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not content with being the world&#8217;s largest e-commerce marketplace, Amazon is expanding its reach with a new styling service for women&#8217;s fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=19190471011&amp;ref_=pss_fq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe</a> launched this week, exclusively for Prime members in the US.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get started via the iOS or Android app by filling out a survey about fit and trend preferences: Like animal prints? Hate going sleeveless in summer?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After learning more about your broad preferences including style, fit, and budget, our stylists will curate inspirational pieces for everyday or help find that perfect look for work, vacation, or a night out,&#8221; the Personal Shopper FAQ said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a combination of technology and &#8220;a personalized human touch,&#8221; trained stylists handpick clothes, shoes, and accessories from thousands of available brands (including the company&#8217;s own).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can preview the picks and select which items to ship in a Prime Wardrobe order.</span></p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDSBeEelz1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers have up to seven days to try everything on at home; simply return any lemons (using Amazon&#8217;s resealable packaging) and pay only for what you keep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stitch Fix and Nordstrom&#8217;s Trunk Club perfected the system years ago, helping to inspire a growing industry of subscription personal styling services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon in 2017 introduced Prime Wardrobe—a try-before-you-pay program that comes free for members. But not everyone has an eye for fashion. So for $4.99 a month, you can let someone else pick your outfits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now you have two great options to bring the fitting room home,&#8221; Amazon boasted. &#8220;With [Prime Wardrobe or Personal Shopper] you can order clothing, shoes, and accessories, and take seven days to decide what you love and only pay for what [you] keep.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe currently styles women&#8217;s apparel in sizes 0-24 and XS-XXL/3X, as well as women&#8217;s shoes in sizes 5-12. Amazon hopes to expand into men&#8217;s selections &#8220;soon.&#8221;</span></p>

				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley Motors is abuzz with new employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Famous for its &#8220;flying B&#8221; emblem, the luxury car maker <a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/967-introducing-bentleys-new-flying-bees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> 120,000 &#8220;flying bees&#8221; of a different kind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of local beekeepers, two national hives of British </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apis Mellifera</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> honeybees have been installed at the edge of Bentley&#8217;s Crewe factory in England.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insects are settling into their new home—grassland sown with bee-friendly wildflowers—and are already showing &#8220;promising signs&#8221; for the first honey harvest this summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each hive has the potential to create around 15kg (approximately 50 jars) of honey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re constantly looking for ways to improve our environmental footprint and achieve our goal of carbon neutral operations,&#8221; Peter Bosch, member of the Board for Manufacturing at Bentley, said in a statement.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1798347" style="max-width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-1798347" src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bees-3.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="388" srcset="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bees-3.jpg 690w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bees-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bees-3-625x352.jpg 625w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bees-3-650x366.jpg 650w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bees-3-141x80.jpg 141w, https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bees-3-130x73.jpg 130w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(via Bentley Motors)</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We already have the largest solar carport in the UK on our site—which means that all of our electricity use is now either solar or certified green,&#8221; Bosch boasted. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve also started to look at ways we can use our site to increase local biodiversity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bees are vanishing at an alarming rate, and humans are largely to blame: We are responsible for the two most prominent causes of death—pesticides and habitat loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More big businesses, however, are doing their part to help save one of the most effective pollinators on Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford last year <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/06/15/new-workers-in-town-ford-launches-beekeeping-program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a global beekeeping program</a> with six hives at its Dearborn World Headquarters in Michigan. The program supports honeybee populations, as well as the local ecosystem and gardening and farming communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Bentley wants to join the fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our &#8216;flying bees&#8217; are honeybees that have been bred by local beekeepers, Bosch explained. &#8220;With their help, we&#8217;re checking on them every week and it&#8217;s great to see that they&#8217;re already starting to produce the first Bentley honey.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Denxybel Montinola, who is just 23 and a recent graduate of the University of San Carlos, says that his gears started turning when he saw a video on Facebook. In it, a researcher was explaining how he produced a bioplastic using only seaweed.</p>
<p>Montinola wanted to see if he could &#8220;recreate [that] invention and take it up a notch.&#8221; Ultimately he decided to add mango peels to the mix. Why mangoes? His home country is one of the world&#8217;s top producers, shipping more than 820,000 tons of the fruit every year.</p>
<p>A good number of those mangoes end up getting peeled and packaged. That creates a ready supply of very cheap — and very useful — ingredients for <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/3k3x75/filipino-scientist-bioplastic-mango-seaweed">a kicked-up bioplastic</a>.</p>
<p>Montinola told his hometown paper <a href="https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/247962/cebuano-to-showcase-bioplastic-made-out-of-mango-peelings-and-seaweed">the <em>Cebu Daily News</em></a> that his mango-seaweed blend is &#8220;more robust and flexible and can mimic the mechanical strength of the conventional plastic.</p>
<p>Not only does it perform better than traditional plastic, but it&#8217;s also not going to wind up contaminating our rivers, streams, soil&#8230; or digestive systems. This bioplastic is completely water-soluble and no toxic chemicals are released as it disintegrates.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, it&#8217;s not going to make a suitable food or beverage container, but there are plenty of other tasks for which it&#8217;s ideal.</p>
<p>It could be a perfect scaffold material for doctors, says Montinola. That&#8217;s a possibility he may investigate further as he completes an internship in Taiwan at the Academia Sinica&#8217;s Institute of Biological Chemistry.</p>
<p>Another that way warrant a closer look is as a material to stop localized bleeding. One day it could help save lives and help save the planet at the same time.</p>

<p>Babbel is a <a href="https://shop.geek.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=geek.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-332589&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004HZoZ&amp;scsonar=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web-based subscription service</a> that makes it easy to learn a new language. Simply log in, choose the language you want to learn, and away you go. Each lesson is only 10 to 15 minutes in length, so it’s perfect for those with busy schedules. That means, if you have the time in your day to go out for a cup of coffee, you have the time to learn a new language.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen embed"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sr12tqDZNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Developed by over 100 linguists, Babbel is changing the way people learn languages. At one time, you’d have had to enroll in a class in your community and attend long training sessions on someone else’s schedule. But, with Babble, you&#8217;re afforded the opportunity to learn the language of your choice<a href="https://shop.geek.com/sales/babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription?utm_source=geek.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=babbel-language-learning-lifetime-subscription&amp;utm_term=scsf-332589&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004HZoZ&amp;scsonar=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on your own terms</a> and at your own pace.</p>
<p>Sure, there are other software-based apps out there, but they tend to be less effective. That’s because, unlike those other options, Babbel focuses on teaching you the words and phrases that you are most likely to use in conversation, so you’ll be able to communicate with native speakers much more quickly.</p>
<p>If you want to learn a new language, then you really need to check out Babbel. And now is a perfect time.
