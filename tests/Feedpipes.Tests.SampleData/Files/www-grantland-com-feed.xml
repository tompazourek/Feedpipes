				<description><![CDATA[Rolling logs, swinging axes, saws aplenty, and even an appearance by the Musky Queen: welcome to the Lumberjack World Championships in Hayward, Wisconsin.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he deal with Hayward is, you can’t get there from here. The nearest interstate highway is about an hour and a half west, over the state line from Wisconsin in Minnesota. Any way you try to approach it, you’re going to have some substantial stretches of time alone with your thoughts as you wind through thick woods and farmlands and a nighttime darkness so total you’re surprised to reach your destination without finding a hook hanging from the car door handle.</p>
<p>Once the sun is safely up, you can navigate toward the Lumberjack Bowl arena by driving past the Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame,<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;The museum is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshwater-fishing.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not hard to spot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a> and toward the cluster of cedar poles sunk into the earth and the array of flags that honor the nations about to be represented in the Lumberjack World Championships. Hayward is a small lake resort town with a permanent population of around 2,300 that balloons each summer as thousands of spectators wedge into a collection of grandstands nestled around a finger-shaped inlet of Hayward Lake that used to serve as a North Wisconsin Lumber Company holding pond for cut timber. For most of the warm months, it serves as a home base for Scheer&#8217;s Lumberjack Show, enticing tourists with feats of woodsy strength and speed. And for one long weekend every year at the end of July, it hosts the world&#8217;s best lumberjacks and lumberjills<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Yes, really.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> for three days of sawing, chopping, logrolling, running, and climbing. The games have progressed with the years &#8212; there are laser timers on the footraces now and teams of women pulling double saws &#8212; but in the crucial ways, things here stay the way they were.</p>
<p>2015 marks the 56th-annual edition of the “Olympics of the Forest,” founded in 1960 &#8220;to perpetuate and glorify the working skills of the American lumberjack,&#8221; and with more than 120 qualifiers, this year’s games boasts the largest field of competitors in event history. The larger sporting sphere looks in every once in a while. <em>Wide World of Sports</em> was here in 1979. The <em>Great Outdoor Games</em>, while they existed, featured its events. Kenny Mayne did a segment at the championships <a href="http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=9933838" target="_blank">in 2013</a>. But whether the outside world is watching or not, the games continue, without a lot of regard to who’s paying attention. These athletes are not here for your cameras. They&#8217;re here for themselves, and for each other, and for a lucky few to be able to go home and say, &#8220;Look at this chain saw I won.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>hursday and Friday of championships weekend are given over to heats and novice contests, and are lighter on tourists, but loud with relatives and supporters of the athletes. Like the entrants, the crowd trends toward the blond and Scandinavian. There are multigenerational-family cheering sections, off-duty policemen idly arguing over whether they could chop trees faster than the entrants, lone fishermen in T-shirts reading YOUR BAIT SUCKS AND YOUR BOAT’S UGLY or I CAN’T HEAR YOU, MY HEAD IS UP MY BASS. Dogs splash in the rushes; a couple of kayakers hang out in the open end of the inlet; a woman in a broad-brimmed sun hat gripes that Green Bay has gotten &#8220;so touristy.&#8221; An audience giveaway is conducted, with the winner taking home one ton of premium wood pellets.</p>
<p>On the nearest side of the inlet to the arena entrance, a dock has been raised to stage the <a href="http://www.lumberjackworldchampionships.com/lumberjack-sawyers.php" target="_blank">sawing</a> and <a href="http://www.lumberjackworldchampionships.com/lumberjack-choppers.php" target="_blank">chopping</a> events that make up the bulk of the schedule. The contests on the main dock range from exactly the kind of thing you&#8217;d expect — standing next to a block of wood and swinging an ax at it, or pulling a saw through a felled tree — to the faintly insane, like the underhand chop (competitors stand on an aspen log and swing axes between their feet to hew it in half) and the springboard chop (this one involves sometimes very large men cutting a notch in an aspen log, sticking a board in the incision, climbing up on that, and repeating the process until they&#8217;re standing on a board 9 feet in the air trying to hack off the top of the pole). There&#8217;s the Jack &amp; Jill, in which male-female teams work double saws through white pine logs, and this year for the first time there&#8217;s the Jill &amp; Jill, featuring two-woman teams.</p>
<p>Competing in the inaugural Jill &amp; Jill event is Erin LaVoie, the 2014 all-around women&#8217;s world title holder. Younger and more compactly built than many of her peers, she doesn&#8217;t look anything like you’d picture conjuring up “lumberjill.” She does look like she could break you in half. The 33-year-old CrossFit gym owner came to the sport not through a family pipeline, like many of her peers, but by happening on a meeting of her college forestry club in Spokane, Washington. &#8220;They had a team just down the hall from where I was taking all my classes,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And I&#8217;m just a competitive person, so I peeked in the room, saw what they were doing, asked a bunch of questions, and then five days later, after picking up my very first ax, I went to a competition and actually, like, <em>won</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearing the opposite end of her career is Sheree Taylor, chicken farmer, captain of the New Zealand women&#8217;s woodchopping team, two-time ESPY nominee for Best Outdoors Athlete,<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="3" href="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Taylor recalls her experience: &amp;#8220;I was so honored, being a non-American, and there I was with Venus and Serena! I said to my husband, I said, &amp;#8216;Look, this&rsquo;ll never happen again.&amp;#8217; So we went out and bought some very nice smart clothes, and to walk on the red carpet and have my own limousine, oh my god! He said, &amp;#8216;I can&rsquo;t get used to this,&amp;#8217; and I said, &amp;#8216;Well I&rsquo;m going to, just for the moment!&amp;#8217; And I said it&rsquo;ll never happen again, and then two years later I got nominated again!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a> and grandmother of three. She&#8217;s looking for a return to form this season, after entering the 2014 games with 50 percent lung capacity due to a pinched phrenic nerve that inflamed her diaphragm. For the first time since she started competing in 1995, the three-time all-around world champ missed out on the finals; this season, she&#8217;s just happy for progress. &#8220;This January I had another test with a respiratory specialist and my breathing capacity was up to 89 percent. And I think it&#8217;s increased since. I&#8217;m excited about it, because it was really horrendous. But anyway, I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Past the dock, heading clockwise around the inlet, a festive village of trucks and tents has been erected by the visiting athletes. In the middle of the bustle, Arden Cogar Jr. is shirtless, faintly coated with sawdust, and wearing brown Birkenstocks over black socks, conducting a business call over an iPhone plugged into a generator outlet next to a pile of sawed-off tree slices.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;These &amp;#8220;wood cookies&amp;#8221; will be branded with the festival name and sold as souvenirs throughout the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a> An attorney in a midsize West Virginia firm, he comes from a <a href="https://gma.yahoo.com/video/unbeatable-american-lumberjack-dynasty-221452524.html" target="_blank">sprawling family of lumberjacking enthusiasts</a>, but didn&#8217;t take the sport seriously until college at WVU, &#8220;when I was humbled into realizing I wasn&#8217;t D-I college football material.&#8221; And while he may be built like an old-timey circus strongman, for Cogar, the most important elements he puts into and gets out of this sport are cerebral. &#8220;Total stress relief is what this is for me. This is what keeps me sane.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m a daily practitioner of yoga and tai chi, and what a lot of people don&#8217;t realize is that this sport is more predicated upon timing and technique than it is brute strength. One of the real truths of this sport is it is an event you can do until your senior years and still be competitive.&#8221; Cogar has a daughter just beginning college, and like her dad at that age, she&#8217;s a dabbler in the sport who hasn&#8217;t really caught the bug yet. &#8220;My guess is once she gets out in the real world and gets her ass kicked a little bit by life, then she&#8217;ll realize woodchopping&#8217;s kind of fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Serenity is also the name of the game in the hot saw competition, where chain saws powered by snowmobile and dirt bike engines blaze through 20-inch white pine logs. &#8220;I’ve trained to be as strong as I possibly can,&#8221; says Chris Bradshaw, another West Virginia native, hefting his 59-pound machine. &#8220;The time I’ve spent in the gym, whenever you’re moving a heavy weight, you’ve got to be so focused, to have your technique exactly right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arden and I are physically the two strongest people that you’ll see here today, OK? But the mental aspect, it’s taken me the last five years to hone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>n the shallows next to either end of the main dock, tiny children are being taught logrolling, a pastime with its roots in 19th-century river drives that floated cut trees from logging camps to sawmills. Then, deaths were common, as workers balancing on logs fell and knocked their skulls on their cargo or slipped beneath floating wood and drowned. Today, kids as young as 4 toddle on <a href="http://www.keylogrolling.com/about-key-log" target="_blank">synthetic beams</a> that spin beneath their feet, learning first just to remain upright through the rotations, and later to buck their opponents off one end of a shared log and into the lake. “Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskellunge" target="_blank">muskies</a> are friendly muskies. They don’t eat kids,” an announcer reassures the U7 division.</p>
<p>The elite logrolling takes place out in the deeper waters, in the middle of the cove. There are a few crossover competitors who divide their time between the strength-based events on the near side of the lake and the speed and agility contests opposite, but for the most part the athletes on the far bank skew younger and lither than those wielding saws and axes. The gaggle waiting for the running and rolling events could pass for a prep school team decked out in custom soccer shoes with metal golf or logging spikes in place of cleats. Two by two, they&#8217;re paired off onto lengths of floating red cedar and pushed away from the dock, where the first roller to fall three times out of five tries will be eliminated. Occasional whistles are blown when stray lily pads drift too near the competition.</p>
<p>There are discrete styles of logrolling on display; most of the male competitors favor a faster-paced match with more frequent tumbles, while the women tend to play more of an endurance game, but the goal is the same: nudge your opponent into the water without touching or breaking the invisible plane that divides the floating log in half lengthwise. And as with the choppers and <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sawyer" target="_blank">sawyers</a>, the best rollers preach clarity of thought as the path to victory. &#8220;It’s definitely a balance,&#8221; says Meredith Ingbretson, a Hayward native and youth logrolling instructor. &#8220;You have to stay mentally focused on what the other person’s doing, so that your physical game can knock them in. Read and react. There’s a lot more to it than you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shana Verstegen, who took home first-place logrolling honors in 2008 and 2012, credits a cooling of nerves, not an uptick in training intensity, with the biggest leaps forward in her athletic career. &#8220;You’re on a 12-inch piece of wood, and if you’re not focused the entire match, it’s all over. But my life doesn’t depend on it. And once I clicked into that mind frame, I started winning. I still train hard. But I wasn’t feeling like throwing up before I got on the log. So not any meditation, but just a constant reminder of why I&#8217;m here and why I do this.&#8221; Eight weeks removed from giving birth, she feels even less pressure this year. “I’ve won a few matches, and it feels good. It’s different, but it&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to fall behind on the main dock, where bearing down and speeding up can allow a lagging lumberjack to catch up to a pack of choppers or sawyers. In logrolling, though, missteps are magnified; one slip and it&#8217;s into the drink. This is even truer on the boom run, where athletes must dash all the way across the inlet, balancing on a series of logs chained end to end, circle a barrel on the main dock, then run back. The boom run used to be a sort of sideshow event, to take up time between chopping contests, but it gained greater prominence with the advent of <em>Great Outdoor Games</em>. &#8220;That’s when everybody got serious about it,&#8221; says Verstegen. &#8220;I had to ship a million logs down to Madison to build our own boom runs, because none of us had even practiced for it. Before, it was kind of just a fun thing to do. Then we all started training.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boom running requires the most overt physical grace and leads to the most undignified wipeouts; falls are frequent and racers can occasionally be seen swimming back to shore rather than attempting to remount the slippery cedar poles.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We have a golden rule here,&amp;#8221; the announcer explains during a heat, &amp;#8220;the competitor going the longest gets the loudest applause.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a> More than the others, just loving this event seems to matter more than who wins or loses, with potential calamity waiting at every step and twitch. On the return trip across the water, runners are not only battling the wake their first sprint created, but that of their opponents, and by the time they near the start/finish line, most runners&#8217; arms are waving as if directing unseen symphony orchestras, propelling the contestants back to land by flailing momentum and pure will. On some of the best boom runs, the racers&#8217; feet never seem to touch the logs at all, adjusting to every slip and slide with inhuman poise. It&#8217;s the ones that don&#8217;t make it look easy that are most memorable, though, slamming onto the dock at 45-degree angles, wresting wins from the jaws of gravity.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hph9rOCqNgM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>here&#8217;s an even bigger battle against the pull of the earth&#8217;s core being waged in the final event, speed climbing. On the far bank of the inlet there’s that stand of 60- and 90-foot poles, capable of inducing reverse vertigo in anyone standing at their base and staring up, surrounded by orange plastic fencing that marks off an area cheerfully referred to as &#8220;the loony bin.&#8221; Lumberjacks outfitted with coils of rope and lineman gaffs, like those worn by utility workers, race straight up and down in contests that look delicately acrobatic from a distance but up close are revealed, through flying sweat and splinters, as something much more powerful and primal.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GctihrBKNo0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For all the talk elsewhere in the arena about mental games, to even attempt to compete in the speed climb it helps to be just the <em>tiniest </em>bit crazy. In the boom run, falls are common; in the logroll they&#8217;re the entire point. In speed climbing, they&#8217;re not so frequent, but they do come with scarier consequences. Defending 60-foot champ Derek Knutson says he still gets nervous every time he straps up. &#8220;When you start racing, you forget about your form. As soon as you make a mistake, you slip and then you’re out of the race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of the race, or worse. Brian Stearns, a 19-year-old boom runner and logroller, recently added the speed climb to his repertoire, and on world championships weekend is competing a week removed from what he casually refers to as &#8220;a pretty bad fall&#8221; from the 60-foot pole at a lumberjack show in Wisconsin Dells that left him with a concussion and lumbar spine injuries. &#8220;It wasn’t a controlled fall,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;because it had rained 30 minutes prior, so there was no friction on the pole. Usually I’m able to control it by pulling the rope in tight and scraping down, but the pole was soaking wet.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I’m going down and I’m still speeding up as I’m falling; I had fallen about 45 feet at this point. I push out from the pole so I don’t smack my head into it, and land with my feet out in front of me. My spine compressed when I landed and then whiplashed my head back. I thought I was paralyzed at first. I was freaking out. My teammate carried me back into our shack, I threw my spikes on and I went back out and did the boom run. We have two booms for the show, and I saw four clearly defined booms. I slapped my face a couple times, slapped my legs, and just ran. I even made it across the first time. I wiped out coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>They actually had to put rules in place on the speed climb to keep athletes from trying the plummet from the top on purpose. To avoid the spectacle of a pile of crumpled lumberjacks at the base of each pole, black bands are painted every 15 feet, and each racer must touch at least one foot in every 15-foot section on the way down. The regulations keep the madness at bay, a little, but the math on this is still somewhat unsettling: For a legal descent on the 90-foot climb, a lumberjack can fling himself backward into space, held within reach of the pole only by a length of rope, touch one foot or the other to the pole six times on the way down, and call it good.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>aturday afternoon brings on the finals. It&#8217;s hot, and still, and as the temperature hovers around the mid-80s, the shaded areas get crowded. The <a href="http://www.heartistrymusic.com/artists_pinery_boys.html" target="_blank">Pinery Boys</a> sing the national anthems of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Czech Republic, and the United States in rapid succession, one for each home country represented in the field, and Erik Maki, a plaid-clad man with a thick Finnish accent,<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;He&rsquo;s American, but all emceeing from Maki is done in the character of Toivo, a Finnish lumber camp cook from the north woods (look, just go with it).&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a> takes over the microphone on the far dock. “Folks, we have spectacular competition lined up for you tonight, and I want to remind you all that audience participation is extremely important. So you have to yell, shout, scream, throw small children into the air! And every time you see something you like, or something you don’t like, you let loose with a great big lumberjack YO-HO!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheree Taylor <a href="http://www.lumberjackworldchampionships.com/competition-results.php" target="_blank">places sixth</a> in the underhand chop and fifth in the master&#8217;s double buck with partner Warrick Hallet. Arden Cogar makes the finals in single buck, standing chop, and underhand; he pairs with Chris Bradshaw to take sixth place in the double buck. Brian Stearns places sixth in logrolling and eighth in the boom run. Meredith Ingbretson sweeps the women&#8217;s boom run and logrolling honors, and then the arena erupts in ovations for Hayward native J.R. Salzman, who won six world logrolling titles and the 2005 ESPY for Best Outdoor Sportsman before deploying to Iraq with the National Guard, where a bomb cost him most of his right arm. He returned to Wisconsin to win three more championships, and today&#8217;s triumph marks his 10th. Taking the microphone, Salzman laughingly admonishes the crowd to not exert themselves on his behalf. “Thank you all, sit down, it’s hot. Enjoy your beverages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just need to thank God above for giving me a second chance. Look, I’ll be honest. I never thought I’d come back and win. I knew I’d come back and roll, but to win four more world titles, it’s a dream come true. I also need to thank my little boy, Brody, for enduring many mosquito-filled nights at the lake. My family for supporting me. And everybody here in the community. The guy that I rolled against in the finals, Brian Duffy, I’ve been rolling with him for over 20 years. I couldn’t ask for a better training partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s choking up a little in spots, and the audience is on its feet again. &#8220;To come back year after year, and have such a great event, there’s no place like it. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Erin LaVoie places second in this year&#8217;s women&#8217;s single buck title race to Lindsay Daun, whose Jack &amp; Jill partner, Dave Jewett, takes the men&#8217;s single buck title. They accept their trophies on the main dock from Rachel Radcliffe, 2015&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apg-wi.com/sawyer_county_record/news/radcliffe-crowned-musky-festival-queen/article_0725100e-1bb3-11e5-bad8-7755a3cd018c.html" target="_blank">Musky Queen</a>,<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;#8217;t really think you were getting out of this story without a pageant queen, did you?&lt;/p&gt;

"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a></p>
<p>The grand finale of the weekend is an exhibition relay of mixed-gender teams racing first on the boom, then underhand chopping, sawing, and finishing on the standing block. A final flurry of chips, another round of cheers, and as the crowds begin to file out, the announcer booms back in. &#8220;How &#8217;bout a hand for all our competitors in the relay race! Ladies and gentlemen, that is the 56th-annual Lumberjack World Championships, presented by lumberjacks eat more, Dinty Moore! The only meal that works so hard, it wears flannel!&#8221;</p>
<p>And just like that, it’s all over for another year. The proceedings in Hayward will reconvene on July 28, 2016, but for now it’s time to retreat en masse to a nearby bar and drink and dance under a dozen watchful mounted deer heads. Organizers here worry about the future of the championships. So much of running these games relies on volunteer labor, and so many key figures within the operation are nearing retirement age. But the vanishing point in this future, if there is one, is just too far off to see. As the craft of lumberjacking has passed from survival, to work, to a pastime, to organized sport, the world has moved on, too — but the waning of the desire to touch this kind of spirituality is impossible to imagine. The games don&#8217;t have to be huge to be sustainable, and to be necessary, because the further away we get from our roots, the greater the desire to get back somehow. You can still find the precise serenity you&#8217;re looking for, and a few sights you never expected to behold, in these athletes rooted to the earth or flinging themselves toward the sky, battling cedar and ash and white pine, and gravity, and equilibrium, and time.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The numbers show that Russell Westbrook became one of the NBA's most efficient assist men last season. Now that Kevin Durant is back healthy, the Thunder could be better than ever.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>ack on October 7, the Oklahoma City Thunder were in Minneapolis playing their first preseason game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Early in the third quarter, Russell Westbrook dribbled left around a Kevin Durant screen to beat defender Tyus Jones into the paint. From there, it wasn’t a matter of when, but how. As Westbrook burst toward the goal, he attracted the direct attention of every single Wolves defender on the floor; in the span of about three seconds, a sequence that began with a ho-hum screen at the top of the arc ended with a comically wide open Serge Ibaka, one of the most lethal <a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-serge-ibaka-expansion-project-the-thunder-forward-on-his-move-beyond-the-arc/" target="_blank">catch-and-shoot bigs</a> in the NBA, knocking down a corner 3.</p>
<p><span class="embed-vine" style="display: block;"><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/eYrKUEwKxpJ/embed/simple" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>
<p>This was not a “defensive breakdown.” This was Westbrook blowing up another set of hopeless defensive principles. And it was a familiar result: Westbrook making good things happen for the Thunder.</p>
<p>The box score encodes that sequence as three points for Ibaka and an assist for Westbrook, but that bookkeeping seems crazy. Like so many Ibaka field goals, this one was born in a galaxy far away from the eventual shot location — at the moment that Westbrook beat his man and compromised the defense. Yes, Ibaka’s reliable catch-and-shoot action neatly punctuated the sentence, but Westbrook provided all its language. To say that Westbrook “assisted” this shot is akin to saying George Lucas “assisted” the creation of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>
<p>“That corner shot is about patience and spacing,” Westbrook told me last Monday at the Thunder’s suburban Oklahoma City practice gym. “I’m able to curate a lot of attention. A lot of eyes are on me when I have the ball, so I’m able to look and see who’s open, which defenders are cheating off their man. And sometimes they cheat off the wrong man, and I just hit them.”</p>
<p>Last season, Ibaka received more Westbrook assists than any other player. Westbrook passes immediately led to 241 Ibaka shots, and Ibaka drained a whopping 55 percent of them. Ibaka says that corner 3s, like the one against Minnesota, are emblematic of his collaboration with Westbrook: “Sometimes he says to me, ‘Serge, stay in the corner, space.’ Then he drives on purpose just to get me open. If the defense doesn’t go help he’s going to kill them under the basket. He’s so aggressive, and so ready to make that play, I always have to be ready to shoot.”</p>
<p>But as fast and as aggressive as Westbrook’s game is, it’s also becoming increasingly heady and dominant. He wasn’t always a point guard. Now he is one of the most effective distributors in the league. Every NBA scorer has his favorite spots; it’s up to their coaches and point guards to get them looks from those spots, and Westbrook knows it. “You gotta find guys where they are comfortable,” he says. “You can’t just give Steven [Adams] the ball at the 3-point line; that’s not gonna help. You gotta be able to know where guys are comfortable and help them make their decisions easy. That’s what I try to do.”</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>njuries didn’t just affect the 2014-15 Thunder season; they completely derailed a squad with legit title hopes. But the health issues that caused Durant and Ibaka to miss 55 and 18 games, respectively, also steered Westbrook into an elevated role. “With people going out, there was certain things I had to do a little more,” he says. Certain things like assuming the most <a href="http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2015/10/19/one-team-one-stat-much-russ/" target="_blank">statistically burdensome offensive load</a> the NBA had seen in almost a decade, and melting our faces with stuff like this.</p>
<p><span class="embed-vine" style="display: block;"><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/O0U2q0FKmPa/embed/simple" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Before last season, few expected Westbrook to win the scoring title, but with Durant sidelined for most of the campaign, Westbrook seemed to make a conscious choice to transform into a scoring machine. But that’s not how he sees it: “Me personally, I don’t think about shots, who shoots, how they shoot, how many times they shoot — that doesn’t really matter to me. All that matters is if we win.”</p>
<p>But as we head into this new season, don’t ask Westbrook how Durant’s return will affect his shot selection; he’ll get annoyed.</p>
<p>“That’s the first question people ask me — if I’m gonna take less shots,” Westbrook says. “Because that’s what everybody thinks. Nobody ever asks: &#8216;Are you gonna rebound more? Are you gonna rebound less?&#8217; They’re always like: ‘You gonna shoot less shots?’ That’s what everybody’s asking me.”</p>
<p>Westbrook took a whopping 22 shots per game last season, by far the most in the league. And many of those shots were unassisted. Westbrook’s favorite jumper is near the elbow — a midrange pull-up that he and his father have called his “cotton shot” since they practiced it endlessly at Jesse Owens Park in Los Angeles throughout Westbrook’s childhood.</p>
<p>“My dad taught me that,” he says. “It’s called that because of the cotton net at the park I grew up at. ‘All cotton’ is what my dad used to say. ‘All net.’ That cotton shot is all I practiced.”</p>
<p><a href="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-303200" src="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png" alt="RUSS_SHOT_CHARTb" width="1024" height="929" srcset="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png 1152w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=768,697 768w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=1024,929 1024w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=750,680 750w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=450,408 450w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=640,581 640w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=190,172 190w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=160,145 160w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=326,296 326w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_shot_chartb.png?resize=236,214 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>A quick look at Westbrook’s shot chart suggests that all that practice has not paid off in efficiency, but those seeking to evaluate Westbrook’s offensive contributions through his shooting behavior are simply doing it wrong. Last season provides the perfect example. Somehow, despite winning the scoring title, Westbrook also ranked fourth in the NBA in assists per game — and it’s that statistical category that may define the next phase in his career.</p>
<p><a href="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-303197" src="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png" alt="RUSS_Constellation_CHARTb" width="1024" height="929" srcset="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png 1152w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=768,697 768w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=1024,929 1024w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=750,680 750w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=450,408 450w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=640,581 640w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=190,172 190w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=160,145 160w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=326,296 326w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_constellation_chartb.png?resize=236,214 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Even though Westbrook won the scoring crown and missed 15 games due to injury, only six NBA players created more shots for teammates in 2014-15 than Westbrook did. And of all the league’s “volume shot creators,” only Stephen Curry turned passes into field goals as reliably as Westbrook did. In short, great things happen on the business end of Westbrook passes.</p>
<p>Last season, 12 players created at least 1,000 shots for teammates. Of these 12, Westbrook ranked second in field goal percentage after the pass.</p>
<p><strong>Most Efficient Shot Creators (FG% Following Passes)</strong><a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Minimum 1,000 shots created for teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a><br />
1. Stephen Curry (56 percent)<br />
2. Russell Westbrook (55 percent)<br />
3. Chris Paul (53 percent)<br />
4. John Wall (53 percent)<br />
5. Rajon Rondo (53 percent)</p>
<p>That list could double as the point guard illuminati, or a list of the NBA’s best quarterbacks, and there’s Westbrook, the creator, blending creative volume and efficiency just as well as the league’s finest playmakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-303199" src="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png" alt="RUSS_PLAYMAKER_CHARTb" width="1024" height="929" srcset="https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png 1152w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=768,697 768w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=1024,929 1024w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=750,680 750w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=450,408 450w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=640,581 640w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=190,172 190w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=160,145 160w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=326,296 326w, https://grantland.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/russ_playmaker_chartb.png?resize=236,214 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Thunder players converted 55 percent of the 1,053 shots they attempted within two seconds of receiving a Westbrook pass last season. For context, Dirk Nowitzki attempted 1,062 shots in 77 games last season; he made 46 percent of them. In other words, aside from winning the scoring title himself, Westbrook used his passing skills to turn his teammates into a composite of a player who&#8217;s more efficient than Dirk Nowitzki.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that NBA players on average convert just 45 percent of their shots, and “potentially assisted” scorers convert 51 percent of their shots leaguewide. At 55 percent, scorers immediately downstream from Westbrook’s passes significantly outperform expectations. Sure, it helps that Westbrook often shares the floor with good shooters, but that’s not quite enough to explain what’s going on here. When you drill down on the numbers, you begin to see compelling evidence that Westbrook creates better looks for his teammates than just about anybody else in the NBA. Just look at his efficiency numbers:</p>
<p><strong>Most Common Shooters After Westbrook Passes</strong><a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Thunder averaged 0.98 points per shot last season.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a><br />
1. Serge Ibaka: 133-of-241; 55 percent; 1.22 points per shot<br />
2. Kevin Durant: 72-of-121; 60 percent; 1.36 points per shot<br />
3. Enes Kanter: 76-of-118; 64 percent; 1.30 points per shot<br />
4. Steven Adams: 69-of-116; 59 percent; 1.19 points per shot<br />
5. Anthony Morrow: 52-of-98; 53 percent; 1.46 points per shot</p>
<p>Westbrook says he creates plays in different ways for different teammates, but also points out that making plays with Durant is his easiest gig. “With him, playmaking is easy,” Westbrook says. “Just find him and get him shots.” While players like Ibaka and Morrow have their favorite catch-and-shoot locations on the floor, a quick look at Durant’s terrifying shot chart from his MVP campaign reminds us that he’s pretty good all over the court. “I’ve seen him score in a lot of different places,” Westbrook adds. “I think his best spot is everywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>estbrook and Durant have grown up together. They were born just six weeks apart in 1988. Durant turned 27 last month; Westbrook will do so in a few weeks. As a birthday gift, Westbrook got Durant a new version of one of KD’s signature accessories.</p>
<p>“I got him a backpack,” Westbrook mentioned during our interview. At this point, I gestured to my backpack, a gray <a href="http://shop.herschelsupply.com/collections/backpacks" target="_blank">Herschel</a>, and asked Westbrook if the one he gave Durant was nicer than mine. “Way better,” he said. I asked him what brand. “It was my backpack,” he answered. “I have a brand.”</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that Westbrook has a strong brand. It would be harder to find another NBA player who seems more confident or more comfortable under the bright lights of the best basketball league in the world. But unlike many of his NBA colleagues, Westbrook wasn’t projected to become an elite pro player until halfway through his college career at UCLA. When he was in high school, his goal was simply to get a free ride to a good university.</p>
<p>“I never thought I’d play professionally, but I wanted to make sure that my parents didn’t have to pay for me to go to college,” Westbrook says. After arriving at UCLA, it didn’t take long for Westbrook to turn heads, including those of more hyped Bruins teammates like Kevin Love.</p>

<p>“I always tell everyone that there was this kid I saw the first day playing up at the UCLA men’s gym, and I said to people that day, ‘There is this kid Russell Westbrook who is going to be a superstar,’” Love recalls. “And everybody said, ‘Who is Russell Westbrook?’”</p>
<p>Love knew Westbrook was bound for glory before anyone, including Westbrook, and the power forward soon found himself telling reporters to take note: “All the college writers would ask me who was going to be the next breakout star at UCLA. And I would say, ‘There’s this guy Russell Westbrook that you have to watch.’ And since then, it’s just been like, <em>boom</em>.”</p>
<p>Westbrook is one of the most explosive point guards the league has ever seen, but don’t let his powder-keg athleticism deceive you — his frenetic, attacking style may look reckless, but it’s ruthlessly efficient. Looking at the Thunder’s most common passer-shooter combinations from last season, it becomes clear that Westbrook is not only the team’s most voluminous distributor; he’s also its most effective. Westbrook was the passer in seven of the Thunder’s 10 most common passer-to-shooter combinations in 2014-15. It just so happens that those were the seven most efficient combos, too:</p>

<p>Westbrook’s passing efficiency is most clearly on display with Thunder catch-and-shoot specialists Ibaka and Morrow, who both appear twice on this list. While Ibaka and Morrow scored 1.22 and 1.46 points per shot off Westbrook passes, respectively, their catch-and-shoot efficiency dipped to 1.10 and 1.05 points per shot, respectively, off passes from Reggie Jackson. The pattern holds for shooting percentages: Ibaka and Morrow shot 55.2 and 53.1 percent, respectively, off Westbrook passes, while converting 43.2 and 41.5 percent, respectively, off Jackson passes. It’s hard to look at these numbers and conclude anything besides that Westbrook generated better looks for his teammates than Jackson did.</p>
<p>Those percentages are incredible, but Westbrook says smart catch-and-shoot plays involve a lot more than an attacker tossing the ball to open shooters. The shooters, he says, have to be smart receivers: “They gotta be able to relocate, find the space, read the guy who has the ball to find the right space away from the defender, and obviously get the shot off.”</p>
<p>Morrow agrees, and describes how, even as a veteran sharpshooter, he’s had to tweak his technique to deal with Westbrook’s speed and style. “His playmaking and his explosiveness in the paint is second to none,” Morrow says. “There’s nobody else that can attack the paint, draw attention, and make plays like he does. We watched some film together last year, and I just learned where he likes to get on the floor and how he likes to pass the ball. I was just trying to put myself in positions where I can be open for him.”</p>
<p>And for Morrow, one drill in particular has helped immensely. He credits Thunder development coach Vin Bhavnani with emphasizing it. “I had to change my workout regimen,” Morrow says. “Sometimes [Westbrook]’s going so fast and there’s so many defenders on him that the passes aren’t always on target. It’s in the area, but it’s not on target. I started doing a lot of shooting drills with Vin now working off of tough passes.</p>
<p>“I compare [Westbrook] to a quarterback under duress,” Morrow continues. “There’s like three people on him. He’s gonna throw it in the air. &#8230; But I can depend on him to find me and he can depend on me to get the shot off.”</p>
<p><span class="embed-vine" style="display: block;"><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/eYrMxOUnLvT/embed/simple" width="300" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> year ago, Westbrook broke the Internet with a string of triple-doubles so marvelous they seemed unreal. He doesn’t care. “Everybody thinks that I care about numbers and things like that, but I really don’t,” Westbrook insists. “I just like to win.” A lot of athletes say that, but with Westbrook it sounds less like bullshit. That’s why he is the way he is; it’s the reason he has worked so hard to become one of the best all-around guards on the planet. Those triple-doubles aren’t statistical milestones, they’re evidence that the dude plays harder and better in every facet than just about any other guard in the league. He’s among the best rebounding, best defending, best scoring, and best assisting guards in the NBA. His best skill is everything.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Which plays caused the widest swings in a team’s numerical chances at winning the World Series?]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Kansas City Royals may have lost last year’s World Series, but in the most indelible moment of the series — indeed, of the season — the Royals held the fate of the championship in their hands. With Kansas City down to its final out in Game 7, trailing by a run to Madison Bumgarner and the San Francisco Giants, Alex Gordon lined a single into the left-center-field gap. Center fielder Gregor Blanco allowed it to bounce past him all the way to the wall. Left fielder Juan Perez had trouble picking up the ball before throwing it to the cutoff man, shortstop Brandon Crawford. Gordon was pulling into third base by the time Crawford had secured the ball.</p>
<p>Gordon would stop there; third-base coach Mike Jirschele held him up. Salvador Perez batted next, needing only a single to tie the game, but he popped out to Pablo Sandoval to give the Giants the title. Jirschele — who showed in Game 6 of the just-completed ALCS that he wasn’t <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/kansas-city-royals-lorenzo-cain-mike-jirschele-jose-bautista-ken-rosenthal-alcs-102415" target="_blank">afraid</a> to gamble on sending a runner home — almost certainly made the <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/alex-gordon-barely-had-a-chance/" target="_blank">correct decision</a>. Gordon’s chances of making it to home safely were roughly the same as Bartolo Colon’s chances would have been to drive him home had he batted instead of Perez.</p>
<p>But arguments over the decision to hold Gordon <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/12485525/mlb-penultimate-play" target="_blank">lingered</a> all winter, not simply because Perez failed to come through, but because we missed out on the incredible drama of a play at the plate that had only two possible outcomes: The Giants record the final out of the game and win the World Series or the Royals score the tying run with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.</p>
<p>As Nate Silver tweeted:</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="500">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You send Gordon, and it&#39;s one of the 5 greatest baseball moments ever, regardless of whether he scores.</p>
<p>&mdash; Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/527661974432518144">October 30, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>You might think that Silver is guilty of some hyperbole, but how do we determine what the “greatest baseball moments ever” are? How do we quantify the impact of a specific play, not just on the odds of winning a game, but on winning a championship?</p>
<p>Quantifying the odds of winning a particular game is not particularly complicated; FanGraphs publishes Win Expectancy Charts of every game (<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/wins.aspx?date=2014-10-29&amp;team=Royals&amp;dh=0&amp;season=2014" target="_blank">here’s</a> last year’s Game 7), and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Baseball-Reference.com</a> lists the WPA — Win Probability Added — of every play in every box score going back to 1914. WPA is computed by figuring out a team’s probability of winning a game — based on the score, the inning, the outs, and the baserunners — before a particular batter hits and afterward, and then calculating the difference.</p>
<p>When Gordon came to bat in the bottom of the ninth, with two outs, the Royals trailing 3-2 with no one on base, Kansas City’s odds of winning were 5 percent. Afterward, with him standing on third base with two outs, K.C.&#8217;s odds had increased to 16 percent. The WPA of that play was 11 percent (16 minus 5).</p>
<p>That, in itself, is an unremarkable number — but by WPA, it wasn’t even Gordon’s most important at-bat of the game. His double in the second inning, which scored Billy Butler from first, cutting the Giants’ 2-0 lead in half and putting the tying run on second, increased the Royals’ odds of winning by 13 percent. The biggest play of the game, in fact, was Perez’s popout — which decreased the Royals’ chances from 16 percent to nothing.</p>
<p>Of course, the impact of Gordon’s final at-bat was muted by Jirschele’s call to hold him at third. If Gordon <em>had</em> tried to score and was ruled safe, the Royals’ odds of winning the game would have increased all the way to 53 percent. That would have bumped the WPA to 48 percent.</p>
<p>More to the point, that would have made Gordon’s CPA — Championship Probability Added — on that at-bat 48 percent as well.</p>
<p>Championship Probability Added <a href="http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2009/04/championship_wp.php" target="_blank">measures</a> how much a particular play influences a team’s chances to win, except instead of measuring its chances to win a <em>game</em>, it measures a team&#8217;s chances to win a World Series. It is calculated simply by multiplying a play’s Win Probability Added by the impact the game has on winning a championship.</p>
<p>For Game 7 of the World Series, that impact is 100 percent — the winner jumps into a dogpile and the loser stews all winter long. For Game 6, the impact is 50 percent, because if the team that leads the series 3-2 wins, its championship odds are 100 percent, but if that team loses, it drops to 50 percent.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;In all these examples, the impact of the game is the same for both teams &mdash; the odds of one team winning the championship are the precise inverse of the other team&rsquo;s odds.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> The impact is also 50 percent for a World Series Game 5 when the two teams are tied at two wins apiece and for Game 7 of a League Championship Series.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;A complete list of the &ldquo;Championship Leverage Index&rdquo; of a particular game can be found by scrolling down to Lesson No. 9 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hardballtimes.com/10-lessons-i-have-learned-about-win-probability-added/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a></p>
<p>The enormous difference in the impact of a play in a World Series Game 7 over the impact of a play in any other game means that the vast majority — but not all — of the biggest plays in baseball history occur in a Game 7.</p>
<p>To assess where Gordon’s play would have ranked, I’ve put together a list of the 15 biggest plays in baseball since 1947, the year the sport integrated, as well as the year that roughly corresponds to the beginning of most fans’ knowledge of the sport (in part due to film evidence becoming available around this time). I have used data from Baseball-Reference.com, whose Play Index makes searching for these plays approximately a million times easier than doing it by hand.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that WPA does not take into account home-field advantage or the individual players involved. It&rsquo;s an approximation of reality, but it&rsquo;s the best one we have.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a></p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, here are the five biggest plays of the pre-1947 era:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>5.</strong> Dom DiMaggio’s two-out, two-run double for the Red Sox to tie Game 7 of the 1946 World Series, 3-3, in the top of the eighth: 32 percent CPA</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>4.</strong> In the same game, Harry Walker’s two-out double for the Cardinals to score Enos Slaughter<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Famously known as &ldquo;Enos Slaughter&rsquo;s mad dash,&amp;#8221; and yes, despite 70 years of storytelling that Slaughter scored from first base on a single, it was in fact a double.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> with the winning run in the bottom of the eighth: 32 percent CPA</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>3.</strong> Ralph Miller’s double play with the series-winning run on third base, another runner on first, and one out in the ninth, which sent Game 7 of the 1924 World Series to extra innings: minus–33 percent CPA</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>2.</strong> Bucky Harris’s two-out, two-run single to tie that Game 7 in the bottom of the eighth (the Senators would prevail at home over the Giants in 12 innings): 35 percent CPA</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>1.</strong> Tris Speaker’s game-tying single for the Red Sox in the bottom of the 10th off the Giants’ Christy Mathewson in Game 8 of the 1912 World Series (Game 2 had been a tie), putting the winning run on third with one out; the runner would score on a sacrifice fly two batters later: 38 percent CPA</p>
<p>Also, a quick mention of some famous plays that don’t make the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carlton Fisk’s 1975 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agkJ5WFNL4k" target="_blank">home run off the foul pole</a> (18 percent CPA) and Kirby Puckett’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dig7fkSg6EY" target="_blank">walk-off home run</a> in 1991 each came in a World Series Game 6, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLY16wmHdUk" target="_blank">Aaron Boone’s walk-off homer</a> in 2003 came in Game 7 of an ALCS. In each case, not only did the walk-off victory give the winning team just a 50 percent chance at winning the World Series, but their teams were already about a 65 percent favorite to win the game: The score was tied and (as each player was leading off) the home team had its full allotment of three outs to try to bring home the winning run.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv7LwhLKlCY" target="_blank">Mookie Wilson’s grounder</a> through Bill Buckner’s legs in 1986 (20 percent CPA) also came with the game tied; the Mets’ comeback as a whole had a massive impact on the series, but it was the product of three singles, a wild pitch, and an error.</li>
<li>Willie McCovey’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlUBhcBsiM0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39m19s" target="_blank">line drive</a> at Bobby Richardson to end the 1962 World Series, with the tying run at third and the winning run at second, is the <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-highest-leverage-moments-in-baseball-history/" target="_blank">highest-<em>leverage</em> plate appearance</a> in baseball history. But because baseball is a game tilted toward the pitcher, the Giants had only a 24 percent chance to win at that moment, which means McCovey’s out cost them only 24 percent. If he had overcome the odds to hit a walk-off single, that play would have been the biggest of all time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, the good stuff. You’ve seen most of these plays before, many of them dozens of times. But no. 1 and no. 2 on the list — the two biggest plays in baseball history — have been almost entirely forgotten. The second-biggest play ever was a double by a light-hitting middle infielder off the greatest closer in baseball history, and the biggest play ever came in what is widely considered the best baseball game of all time, but has become almost completely overshadowed by what happened afterward.</p>
<h2>15. David Freese’s Triple</h2>
<p>[mlbvideo id=&#8221;19955017&#8243; width=&#8221;560&#8243; height=&#8221;300&#8243; /]</p>
<p><strong>Setting:</strong> 2011 World Series, Game 6 (Texas 3, St. Louis 2)<br />
<strong>Score:</strong> 7-5, Texas<br />
<strong>Situation:</strong> Bottom of the ninth, two outs, men on first and second<br />
<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 8 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Freese hits two-run triple, ties the game 7-7<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 62 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added: </strong>27 percent (54 percent to win Game 6)</p>
<p>Game 6 of the 2011 World Series is almost certainly the greatest baseball game played this century; it’s probably one of the five best baseball games ever. It says something that David Freese’s walk-off home run leading off the bottom of the 11th inning was only the fourth-biggest play of the game — behind Lance Berkman’s single to tie the score with two outs in the bottom of the 10th, Josh Hamilton’s two-run homer in the top of the 10th, and Freese’s previous at-bat, which is featured here. (All four plays rank among the 10 biggest plays in a Game 6.)</p>
<p>With the Cardinals down to their final out, losing by two with the tying run at first base, Freese sliced a line drive to deep right field, where Nelson Cruz — a man better known for crushing fly balls than defending them — stood. Cruz not only let the ball get over his head, but allowed it to roll past him after it ricocheted off the wall, allowing Berkman to score from first and Freese to get to third. Freese’s hit had the biggest WPA of any World Series hit ever that didn’t give its team the lead.</p>
<p>CPA underrates the value of this play slightly, because it doesn’t take into consideration the count — it was a 1-2 pitch and the Cardinals were one strike away from elimination — or that Berkman, who was 35 years old and not particularly fast even in his younger days, was on first base. (Before you criticize the Cardinals for not pinch running for him: They were completely out of position players on their bench.)</p>
<p>Oh, and in his next plate appearance <em>after </em>his walk-off home run, with two outs and two on in the first inning of Game 7, Freese doubled in two runs to pull the Cardinals even at 2-2. That double had the highest CPA (20 percent) of any first-inning hit ever. It’s a safe bet that no player in history improved his team’s odds of winning a championship more over the course of three straight at-bats than David Freese did in 2011.</p>
<h2>14. Kirk Gibson’s Walk-off</h2>
<p>[mlbvideo id=&#8221;3364800&#8243; width=&#8221;560&#8243; height=&#8221;300&#8243; /]</p>
<p><strong>Setting:</strong> 1988 World Series, Game 1<br />
<strong>Score:</strong> 4-3, Oakland<br />
<strong>Situation:</strong> Bottom of the ninth, two outs, man on second<br />
<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 13 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Gibson homers, wins game for Dodgers, 5-4<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 100 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added: </strong>27.2 percent (87 percent to win Game 1)</p>
<p>There’s not much about this game winner that isn’t known already. It takes a massively improbable World Series Game 1 play to crack this list. Gibson’s home run qualifies. It is the only walk-off home run in postseason history that occurred with a team down to its final out. Not surprisingly, the WPA for this game (87 percent) is the highest ever in the playoffs.</p>
<h2>13. Willie Stargell’s Two-Run Shot</h2>

<p>Stargell was a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but in 1979 his career was on its last legs. He was 39, he had long ago moved to first base, he couldn’t run, and he needed to be rested often. But when Stargell played, he could still mash, hitting .281/.352/.552 in 1979. He was also the clubhouse leader for the &#8220;We Are Family&#8221; Pirates, who won 98 games and swept the NLCS.</p>
<p>Stargell won the NL MVP award, tying for first place with Keith Hernandez, in a vote driven by pure sentimentalism — by <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/about/war_explained_position.shtml" target="_blank">bWAR</a>, Stargell was just the ninth-best player <em>on the Pirates</em> that year. But if Stargell didn’t deserve the MVP award for his regular-season exploits,<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Voting for the MVP award occurs before the playoffs start.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a> he made up for it in Game 7 of the World Series, turning a 1-0 deficit with 11 outs to go into a 2-1 lead. The Orioles would load the bases in the eighth but Eddie Murray would fly out to the warning track; the Pirates would add two insurance runs in the ninth and hold on to win the World Series.</p>
<h2>12. Sid Bream’s Double-play Ball</h2>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BT_MODis138?start=6704&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Setting:</strong> 1991 World Series, Game 7 (Minnesota 3, Atlanta 3)<br />
<strong>Score:</strong> 0-0<br />
<strong>Situation:</strong> Top of the eighth, one out, bases loaded<br />
<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 68 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Bream grounds into a 3-2-3 double play<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 39 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added: </strong>minus–29 percent</p>
<p>This half-inning is most famous for what happened earlier, when Lonnie Smith, running from first base with none out, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM5kHJUBRSE" target="_blank">deked</a> by second baseman Chuck Knoblauch into thinking Terry Pendleton’s double into the gap was actually a double-play grounder. Smith wound up at third base when he could have scored the game’s first run if he had kept tabs on the ball.</p>
<p>But Smith’s mistake wasn’t that significant in the moment — the Braves still had men on second and third with none out. Their win expectancy was 76 percent; if Smith had scored on the play it would have been around 82 percent instead. But then Jack Morris got Ron Gant to ground out to first base with the runners holding, and then intentionally walked David Justice to pitch to the glacial Sid Bream. The move worked about as well as any intentional walk ever and Bream tapped into the inning-ending double play. This play has the most <em>negative</em> CPA score since 1947, or to put it another way, the pitch that Morris threw to get the double play was the best any pitcher has thrown in the past 70 years.</p>
<p>The game stayed scoreless, the Twins won in the 10th inning, and Smith, not Bream, wound up the goat forever. As we shall see, Bream would earn some small measure of redemption the following year.</p>
<h2>11. Cookie Lavagetto’s Double</h2>

<p><strong>Setting:</strong> 1947 World Series, Game 4 (New York Yankees 2, Brooklyn Dodgers 1)<br />
<strong>Score:</strong> 2-1, New York<br />
<strong>Situation:</strong> Bottom of the ninth, two outs, men on first and second<br />
<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 18 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Lavagetto hits a walk-off double for the Dodgers<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 100 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added:</strong> 30.75 percent (82 percent to win Game 4)</p>
<p>This game retains some measure of fame today, even though the Dodgers would ultimately lose the series in seven games. Bill Bevens, starting for the Yankees, had not allowed a hit through eight innings. What he had allowed were eight (!) walks &#8212; one of which led to a run when the runner came around to score &#8212; but he went to the bottom of the ninth still nursing a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>With one out, Bevens walked Carl Furillo, then got Spider Jorgensen to foul out. Al Gionfriddo pinch ran for Furillo and stole second base, prompting an intentional walk of Pete Reiser — Bevens’s 10th walk of the game. Lavagetto pinch hit against Bevens, who stayed in because this was 1947 and you didn’t pull a starter who had a no-hitter going even if it might cost you a World Series game.</p>
<p>Lavagetto doubled off the right-field wall and the Dodgers walked off, 3-2. Other than Kirk Gibson’s home run, there has never been another walk-off in a World Series with the home team down to its last out.</p>
<h2>10. Joe Carter!</h2>

<p><strong>Setting:</strong> 1993 World Series, Game 6 (Toronto 3, Philadelphia 2)<br />
<strong>Score:</strong> 6-5, Philadelphia<br />
<strong>Situation:</strong> Bottom of the ninth, one out, men on first and second<br />
<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 34 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Carter hits a series-ending home run<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 100 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added</strong>: 33 percent (66 percent to win Game 6)</p>
<p>You might also be familiar with this play. You can quibble with whether the Blue Jays’ odds of winning before his home run were just 34 percent — Mitch Williams, pitching for the Phillies, was so lost on the mound at this point that he would have had trouble throwing strikes to Jimmy Carter, let alone Joe Carter. But still, a series-ending homer is a series-ending homer. When Tom Cheek said, “Touch ’em all, Joe, you’ll never hit a bigger home run in your life!” he knew of what he spoke — according to CPA, 22 years later, <em>no one</em> has hit a bigger home run. It is one of only two walk-off home runs ever to end a World Series. The other one is coming up.</p>
<p>There have been 56 walk-off plays in World Series history. This was one of only four that came with the home team losing. The other three: Gibson’s homer, Lavagetto’s double, and Dane Iorg’s pinch-hit bases-loaded single to win Game 6 of the 1985 World Series.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="17" href="#fn-17" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;m a Royals fan.

<p>There have been 37 <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/53084/ranking-all-36-world-series-game-7s" target="_blank">World Series Game 7s</a>, and this is almost certainly the best of them — which makes this the best baseball game ever. It was a damn miracle when the only known film copy of the full game was <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5611152" target="_blank">found</a> in Bing Crosby’s wine cellar 50 years later. (You can watch the whole game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ktmTkB0kw" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The Pirates took an early 4-0 lead, but the Yankees got one back when Moose Skowron homered to lead off the fifth, and in the top of the sixth, the Yankees’ first two batters reached. Roger Maris fouled out, but Mickey Mantle singled to make it a 4-2 game, and then Yogi Berra followed with his drive into the right-field bleachers to give the Yankees a 5-4 lead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Yogi, this game was just getting started. Berra’s home run is the biggest hit in baseball history for a team that ultimately lost the game.</p>

<p>Carlton Fisk’s home run in Game 6 is the iconic moment of this World Series, because of the image of him waving his arms, because his home run ended the game, and perhaps most importantly, because the home team won. A roaring home crowd lends more drama to a moment than a crowd that sounds like a morgue.</p>
<p>Joe Morgan’s single in Game 7 silenced the crowd and drove in the series-winning run for the Reds. That there were two outs when he batted in the ninth made his single even more valuable — had he made an out, the Red Sox would have batted needing only one run to win a championship, knowing that the worst thing that could happen was that they’d go to extra innings. It was the Big Red Machine’s third clutch hit in four innings, following Pete Rose’s game-tying single in the seventh and Tony Perez’s two-run homer in the sixth, to complete the comeback after being down 3-0.</p>
<h2>7. Edgar Renteria’s Bases-Loaded Single</h2>

<strong>Championship Probability Added: </strong>34 percent</p>
<p>The Cleveland Indians had been three outs away from their first championship since 1948, but in the ninth inning, closer Jose Mesa allowed a leadoff single to Moises Alou and a one-out single to Charles Johnson that moved Alou to third (a hit that narrowly missed our list, with a 25 percent CPA), and then Craig Counsell tied the game with a sacrifice fly. The stage was set for Renteria’s 11th-inning heroics.</p>
<p>Indians second baseman Tony Fernandez booted a ground ball with a man on first and one out in the 11th, putting the winning run at third base. New pitcher Charles Nagy intentionally walked Jim Eisenreich to load the bases, and the move almost worked when Devon White grounded into a forceout at the plate. But then Renteria, barely 21 years old at the time, whistled a line drive that Nagy managed to glance with his glove, but couldn’t stop it from going into center field.</p>
<p>There have been five walk-off hits in a World Series Game 7. This is the only one that occurred with two outs.</p>
<h2>6. Bobby Thomson’s Shot</h2>

<p>THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT!</p>
<p>This is the biggest play in a regular-season game ever, by such an enormous margin that I don’t even know what would rank second — no other play came close. (Today’s three-round playoff format makes it impossible for any regular-season play to have a CPA of higher than about 12 percent.) And it might have ranked even higher if there had been two outs, or if the tying run hadn’t been at second base, which would have allowed a single to tie the score. Still, when you hit a home run that inspires classic works of literature, both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld_(DeLillo_novel)" target="_blank">fiction</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/books/review/Thorn.t.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">nonfiction</a>, you’ve done all right.</p>

<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 85 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added: </strong>36 percent</p>
<p>Bob Gibson had already started World Series Game 7s in 1964 and 1967 when he made this start, making him the only pitcher in history to start three Game 7s. And in each of the previous two starts, he threw a complete-game victory.</p>
<p>That would not be the case in 1968. After retiring the first two batters in the top of the seventh, Gibson gave up singles to Norm Cash and Willie Horton to bring up Northrup. Northrup drove a ball to deep center field, and Curt Flood — who won seven Gold Gloves for his play in center — made a rare misplay, taking an awkward route to the ball and nearly slipping in the process. The ball got over his head for a two-run triple. It was the biggest hit by a road team in baseball history.</p>
<p>Bill Freehan followed with a double to score Northrup; the Tigers got an insurance run off Gibson in the ninth; and Tigers starter Mickey Lolich, working on two days’ rest, went the distance, giving up only a meaningless two-out homer to Mike Shannon in the ninth before closing out the 4-1 win.</p>
<h2>4. Francisco Cabrera Sends Atlanta to the World Series</h2>

<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 26 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Cabrera singles, two runs score, Braves win<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 100 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added</strong>: 37 percent (74 percent to win NLCS Game 7)</p>
<p>It’s not often you get to see a murder up close, but I once watched Francisco Cabrera <a href="https://grantland.com/features/when-long-shot-your-best-shot/" target="_blank">murder an entire franchise</a> on national television.</p>
<p>The strangest part of this game’s legacy is that Barry Bonds somehow emerged the goat. True, his throw from left field was slightly off-line and not particularly strong; letting <em>Sid Bream</em> score from second base was not only devastating but humiliating. But somehow time has stretched the truth of the play — the story now is that Bonds fielded Cabrera’s line drive, pulled a Sharpie out of his back pocket, autographed the ball, refused to toss it to two adorable cancer-stricken children in the front row, and then threw it to the plate underhand.</p>
<p>It was a poor throw. It wasn’t remotely the worst thing the Pirates did in that inning.</p>
<p>Somehow, Bonds is remembered more than starter Doug Drabek, who came into the ninth with a 2-0 lead and allowed a leadoff double and then a walk before he was pulled. Bonds is remembered more than closer Stan Belinda, who inherited a bases-loaded, no-outs situation and almost pulled it out, sandwiching a pair of outs around a walk before surrendering the fateful hit. Most egregiously, Bonds is remembered more than second baseman Jose Lind, who booted a routine ground ball with a man on second and no one out, allowing Cabrera to bat in the first place.</p>
<p>That’s not to take anything away from Cabrera, who amassed just 92 hits in his brief career — Baseball-Reference lists his primary position as “Pinch Hitter” — yet delivered the biggest pinch-hit ever. This was the biggest play in history that wasn’t in Game 7 of the World Series, let alone the World Series itself. Unfortunately for Cabrera, it was also the biggest play in history that didn’t result in a team winning a championship.</p>
<h2>3. Bill Mazeroski Homers for the Win</h2>
<p>[mlbvideo id=&#8221;3218957&#8243; width=&#8221;560&#8243; height=&#8221;300&#8243; /]</p>

<strong>Event:</strong> Bill Mazeroski homers to win the series<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 100 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added:</strong> 37 percent</p>
<p>A play this famous needs little embellishment. Among other things, this home run is probably the reason Mazeroski is in the Hall of Fame.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="18" href="#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason he&rsquo;s in the Hall of Fame. Mazeroski won eight Gold Gloves and is considered by many to be the best second baseman ever. But his candidacy was borderline and he wasn&rsquo;t inducted until 2001, by the Veterans Committee; the home run may well have tipped the scales in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-18">18</sup></a> But here’s something you probably didn’t know: It wasn’t the most important play in this game.</p>
<h2>2. Tony Womack’s Game-Tying Double</h2>

<p><strong>Setting:</strong> 2001 World Series, Game 7 (Arizona 3, New York Yankees 3)<br />

<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 35 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Womack doubles to tie the game and move the winning run to third base<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 85 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added: </strong>50 percent</p>
<p>Yes, <em>that</em> Tony Womack. The one who had a career line of .273/.317/.356, good for a 72 OPS+. The one who played 13 years in the majors and managed only 2.3 bWAR for his entire career.</p>
<p>But with the Diamondbacks down a run in the ninth against The Greatest Closer Who Ever Lived, Womack came through. Mark Grace had started the rally with a leadoff single, and then Mariano Rivera threw the ball away on a sacrifice bunt attempt, putting men on first and second with none out. Rivera partially redeemed himself when the next hitter bunted and Rivera got the lead runner at third base, bringing up the light-hitting Womack. Rivera’s cutter was death on left-handed hitters. The Yankees were still favored to win.</p>
<p>Then Womack somehow kept his hands back on an inside cutter and pulled it down the right-field line. The game was not only tied — the winning run was on third base with just one out. Rivera then hit Craig Counsell with a pitch to load the bases, and with the infield drawn in, Luis Gonzalez was able to fist a pitch into short left field to end the series.</p>
<p>The best reliever ever, the best <em>postseason</em> pitcher ever, against a really bad hitter. And the hitter won. That’s baseball. That’s why we watch.</p>
<h2>1. Hal Smith. <em>Hal Smith? </em>HAL SMITH!</h2>
<p>[mlbvideo id=&#8221;13006089&#8243; width=&#8221;560&#8243; height=&#8221;300&#8243; /]</p>

<strong>Score:</strong> 7-6, New York<br />
<strong>Situation:</strong> Bottom of the eighth, two outs, men on first and third<br />
<strong>Win Probability Beforehand:</strong> 30 percent<br />
<strong>Event:</strong> Smith hits a three-run homer to give Pittsburgh a 9-7 lead<br />
<strong>Win Probability Afterward:</strong> 93 percent<br />
<strong>Championship Probability Added: </strong>64 percent</p>
<p>The biggest play in major league history — by a significant margin — and it’s almost forgotten today. But that’s the kind of game this was. After Yogi Berra’s three-run homer gave the Yankees a 5-4 lead in the sixth, New York tacked on two more runs in the top of the eighth. But down three runs with six outs to go, Pittsburgh rallied. Gino Cimoli and Bill Virdon singled to lead off the bottom of the eighth, and Dick Groat singled to make it 7-5. A sacrifice bunt was followed by a shallow fly ball, and then, with two outs, Roberto Clemente beat out an infield single while driving home Virdon to make it 7-6.</p>
<p>That’s when Hal Smith, a lifelong second-string catcher — this was his first at-bat of the game; he had only in only after starter Smokey Burgess was taken out for a pinch runner in the seventh — clubbed a three-run homer to left field, making it 9-7, Pittsburgh. This is about as big as a hit can be without being a walk-off: turning a deficit into a lead with two outs in the eighth inning. The Pirates went from being underdogs to having the game in hand.</p>
<p>They didn’t, though, because the Yankees rallied for two runs in the top of the ninth: Mantle drove in the first with a single and Berra tied the game with a groundout. All of which set the stage for Mazeroski, not Smith, to be remembered forever. Mazeroski got the glory. Smith, however, had the biggest hit of the game, the series, and — to this point, at least — all time.</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>nd that’s what’s most fascinating: 112 years after the first World Series was played, we still haven’t maxed out the drama. Baseball has seen walk-off home runs with a team down to its final out (Kirk Gibson). It has seen walk-off home runs in Game 7 of a World Series (Bill Mazeroski), and to win a championship after the home team had been losing (Joe Carter). It has seen a walk-off hit with a team down to its final out in Game 7 &#8230; of an NLCS (Francisco Cabrera). It has seen a go-ahead home run in a Game 7 with the home team losing and down to its final out &#8230; of the eighth inning (Hal Smith).</p>
<p>But the sport has yet to put all of those elements together. We have yet to see a World Series Game 7 won on a walk-off hit in the bottom of the ninth with the home team losing. Home teams have come back in the bottom of the ninth inning or later in a Game 7; they did so in 1912, 1997, and 2001. But each time, the game-tying and game-winning hits were separate events.</p>
<p>That’s what made last season’s finish more memorable for what <em>didn’t</em> happen than for what did. Nate Silver was right: If Alex Gordon had tried to score and been safe, the CPA for that play would have been 48 percent, making it the third-biggest play (behind only Womack’s double and Smith’s homer) in major league history.</p>
<p>But not only was it the right move to hold Gordon at third base, it opened the door for something even more dramatic. Salvador Perez batted representing both the final out of the season <em>and</em> the potential championship-winning run. Not only has no one ever come through with a walk-off hit with his team losing in Game 7, Perez was only the fourth player in history to even <em>bat</em> with his team down to its final out but with the ability to win the series with one swing. (The others were Willie Mays and Willie McCovey, back-to-back, in 1962, and Pete Rose in 1972.)<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="19" href="#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Bob Meusel would have been the first player to get this chance way back in 1926, but before Meusel could complete his at-bat, Babe Ruth decided to try to steal second base. It did not go well.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-19">19</sup></a></p>
<p>Perez didn’t come through, but that he even had the chance to try was rare enough that it deserves to be remembered. Baseball has given us so many signature moments over the years. It seems only inevitable that one day, in the not-so-distant future, it will finally present us with <em>the</em> signature moment we’ve been denied so far.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[An intimate portrait of the former ‘Saturday Night Live’ star’s career and life, one year after she was laid to rest.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> theatrical and sometimes solitary child who grew up in Georgia during the 1960s and ’70s, Decatur-born Jan Hooks spent summers and holidays at her maternal grandparents’ home in the small city of Cedartown, not far outside Atlanta. Throughout her adolescence, she often put on plays and skits there, but it was her barn-burning impression of Tina Turner that became a Thanksgiving tradition. Those mini-concerts featured Jan belting “Proud Mary” while whipping her hair and crazily gyrating. “It was absolutely amazing,” her cousin Susan Brown says. “That was always one of the things we <em>had</em> to have.”</p>
<p>Jan visited Cedartown at least annually for decades, well into her adulthood. In the fall of 2014, she returned for good. On October 17 — a year ago this month, and eight days after she died at age 57 in her upstate New York home — the former <em><a href="https://grantland.com/snl/" target="_blank">Saturday Night Live</a></em> star was laid to rest at Cedartown’s Northview Cemetery in a plot next to that of her mother, Sadie. Come to say their final farewells, a group of 30 or so friends and family members assembled at the Lester C. Litesey Funeral Home, where Jan’s plain dark-wood casket was closed. Next to it, on a small table, sat a large framed portrait of Jan, surrounded by floral arrangements from her former <em>SNL</em> boss Lorne Michaels, the show’s staff, and her onetime boyfriend turned costar, Kevin Nealon. Later, at the cemetery, her brother Tom led graveside proceedings. “This service may be a little different than what you’re used to,” he said. “But hey, so was Jan.”</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>lmost from the moment she appeared on <em>SNL</em> in October 1986, after the then-decade-old program had nearly been canceled, Jan stood out as one to watch. Having already honed and showcased her comedic skills on many stages and screens — as part of Atlanta sketch group the New Wit’s End Players, the short-lived cable program <em>Tush</em>, HBO’s <em>Not Necessarily the News</em>, and as Tina the chipper Alamo tour guide in <em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em> — she quickly established herself as one of the most talented and versatile cast members in <em>SNL</em> history. Over five increasingly celebrated seasons, Jan became well known if never breakout big for her comic timing and crackling impersonations of Tammy Faye Bakker, Nancy Reagan, and Kathie Lee Gifford, to name just a few. Revered <em>SNL</em> writer Jack Handey, the creator of “Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer” and the segment “Deep Thoughts,” says he ranks Jan “with the top two or three cast members, ever.” A two-year stint as wide-eyed and dim-witted divorcée Carlene Frazier Dobber on CBS’s <em>Designing Women</em> came next, as did minor movie parts (in <em>Batman Returns</em> and <em>Coneheads</em>, among others). In a recurring guest role that lasted from 1996 to 2000 and earned her an Emmy nomination, Jan played Harry Solomon’s (French Stewart) floozy girlfriend Vicki Dubcek on <em>3rd Rock From the Sun</em>. She also voiced Kwik-E-Mart owner Apu’s wife, Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon, in a half-dozen episodes of <em>The Simpsons</em>.</p>
<p><aside class="espn-boxout" id="boxout-300690"><h4>Jan Hooks on Phil Hartman</h4><a href="http://gran.tl/1Gfpxh5" target="_blank">Read Hooks's 1998 memorial speech, recorded at a tribute event for Phil Hartman at the Paramount Theatre in Hollywood.</a></aside>But Jan had an uneasy relationship with fame and show business that may have been most evident during her time at <em>SNL</em>, when her onstage confidence masked deep and nagging anxiety. “Sometimes if I see an old show, I think, ‘Boy, I was good!’” she said a couple of years ago when we spoke for my 2014 biography of her late friend and <em>SNL</em> colleague <a href="https://grantland.com/features/the-glue-understanding-the-comedy-of-phil-hartman-saturday-night-live-newsradio-the-simpsons/" target="_blank">Phil Hartman</a>. A stabilizing presence, Hartman was the “rock” who more than anyone else quelled her stage fright. “I mean, you can’t tell how shit-scared I was,” Jan went on. “And you know how they say, ‘Oh, everybody’s got the jitters,’ and then you get out there and you’re fine? No! I wasn’t! I didn’t like it! I don’t like roller coasters, and I don’t like circus performing. It’s just not my thing. The music was too loud. The people, the energy of it just made me very nervous.” It was, she added, “an awful, awful time. And I didn’t care. I didn’t want to be [famous]. I didn’t want to be on TV!”</p>
<p>Her friend Ann Hornaday, now movie critic for the <em>Washington Post</em>, says Jan felt ambivalent toward <em>SNL</em> and fame in general. “I feel like she spent half her time wishing her stuff would be cut, just because she was so anxious,” Hornaday says. “And yet, this is what she did the best. And when she did go out there, she killed it every time.” While Jan’s success on <em>SNL</em> led to other high-profile ventures, mostly in television, she never achieved the career heights she might have — that others thought she could have. Instead, she was a reluctant celebrity who worked only when she felt like it, allowed fate to plot her professional course, and in the end led an intensely private life away from showbiz. Her death took many by surprise.</p>
<p>Although she kept a small apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, most of Jan’s final years were spent in Bearsville, New York, a tiny hamlet within the town of Woodstock, where she bought a shabby 130-year-old farmhouse on 66 acres in the late ’90s, and which became her refuge. There, she watched and rewatched terrible old films (the worse, the better — she loved, for instance, <em>The Oscar</em>, featuring Frank Sinatra), drank untold gallons of Robert Mondavi Sauvignon Blanc (nicknamed Bobby Mo), rode her albino horse (also named Bobby Mo), and puttered around the property as her dark green 1983 Jaguar sat rotting in the garage. Two German shepherds, Frank and Kitty, kept her company until they died. An unabashed smoker, she purchased boxes of her favorite brand, Merit, on the cheap in neighboring Pennsylvania. Friends say they never heard her talk of quitting or using a nicotine patch, both of which she considered laughable.</p>
<p>Tom Chase, a Bearsville native who became Jan’s handyman and good friend, says she arrived there with the intention of chilling out more or less permanently, and working only enough to maintain her health insurance through the Screen Actors Guild. Jan would tell him, half-jokingly, “I was a star, baby!” But she seemed fine with leaving that world behind. “She was up there in Woodstock, on her own, which would drive me nuts,” Hornaday says. “I would just be climbing the walls. But she didn’t really mind it. She cultivated her solitude. She craved her solitude.”</p>
<p>Not everyone understood why Jan allowed her career to fizzle. Between 2002 and 2013 she did only four television episodes and one film. Two of the jobs were voice-overs. “She lived the life she wanted to,” Nealon wrote in a heartfelt tribute <a href="http://time.com/3491489/kevin-nealon-jan-hooks/" target="_blank">published on Time.com</a> a day after Jan’s death. “To me, it seemed as though she was shunning Hollywood. She didn’t want to continuously have to prove herself. If she wanted to, I believe Jan could have been a huge star. But ultimately her privacy was more important.” Moreover, he now says, she “didn’t want to deal with all the B.S. that came with [fame]. It wasn’t worth it to her. Also, she was fighting her own demons &#8230; I think Jan had issues with a lot of different things, and there were a lot of different layers to her. But she certainly had the talent, and based on her talent alone she could have been huge.” Jan’s friend Bill Tush, with whom she worked on <em>Tush</em> (a.k.a. <em>The Bill Tush Show</em>) at Ted Turner’s pre-TBS cable station WTBS, believes she “easily could have been a Julia Roberts.” Achieving that, however, would have required considerable effort, and Jan “would blow off jobs all the time. Not auditions, but jobs.” As Tush remembers it, Jan was offered the role of the mayor’s wife in a 2003 television remake of <em>The Music Man,</em> but she couldn’t be bothered to attend a meeting about the role. “Naw,” she said, “I’m not going in.” (The director, Jeff Bleckner, doesn’t recall if Jan was in the running for that part, which ultimately went to Molly Shannon.)</p>
<p>Tush has no explanation for Jan’s indifference, only theories: “There are times when you’re drunk enough that you don’t give a shit. As a person who went through it [myself], you get to a point where you’re like, ‘I don’t want to do that. I don’t care about that.’” Jan’s drinking took a physical toll, too. Tush says a doctor even advised her to stop because of the liver damage it was causing, but she paid him no heed. From a financial standpoint, Tush adds, Jan was “in a situation where she didn’t need the work. And I think she felt she was a big enough celebrity that she didn’t need to do any more of that. But when she turned down that [job], I couldn’t believe it.”</p>
<p>Jan liked money and some creature comforts (spa days were a favorite indulgence), but they never ruled her life or career — never caused her to fight for the next job or another payday. “She didn’t seem that hungry,” Nealon says. “She moved out to L.A. and she was going through all the motions, but it’s almost like she knew she was going to make it. And I knew she was going to make it, and there was no desperation from her. She hated that side of actresses or actors that were so desperate to make it. I think there was a certain part of her that did not respect the business, because she saw it for what it was. It was so shallow and so ethereal and it didn’t really mean a lot, which is another reason I was attracted to her. Because here was this incredible ray of talent that didn’t even seem to try that hard.” As Jan told the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> in 1985, not long after <em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em> premiered and she’d finished work on her next movie, Goldie Hawn’s <em>Wildcats</em>, “The timing of my life has been so incredible. If I manipulate it, boy, it all goes to pieces. I really rely on fate, and it means a lot of months of unemployment sometimes, but it seems to always come through.” By Jan’s own account, the previous year — following short stretches on ABC’s <em>1/2 Hour Comedy Hour</em> and <em>Comedy Break</em> with duo Jamie Alcroft and Mack Dryden — had been “just desolate,” but then <em>Big Adventure</em> came along and things picked up considerably from there. She was soon hired by <em>SNL</em>. Unorthodox though it was, her passive approach worked fine for a couple of decades. Then Jan stopped trying and offers stopped coming. Mostly.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>n the second half of 2009, while Jan was still rebounding from leukemia that had been diagnosed in February and treated in March and April (it went into remission that May), NBC and Tina Fey came calling. A devoted Jan fan, Fey wanted the actress she has described as “an idol of mine” and “just the funniest woman ever” to play Jenna Maroney’s trashy mom, Verna, on <em>30 Rock</em>. The episode, titled “Verna,” was set to shoot in early December and air in February 2010. Jan was reluctant. “We called her and said, ‘Do you want to do this?’&#8221; Fey remembered in an <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/10/21/tina-fey-remembers-jan-hooks/17649987/" target="_blank">October 2014 acceptance speech</a> at <em>Elle</em>’s Women in Hollywood Awards, during which she dedicated her honor to Jan. “And she was like, ‘OK?’ She was actually a little shy about jumping back into the game.” Fey added: “It made me sad when she [died], and it made me mad at the time how available she was. Jan should have had a bigger career. Jan deserved a big movie career — certainly as big as Rob Schneider&#8217;s fucking career. She was a bigger star on <em>SNL</em>.” Hornaday thinks Fey’s comments, though well-meaning, were a bit misleading. “It’s not like [Jan] wanted all this and she didn’t get it,” Hornaday says. “It’s not like she had doors slammed in her face. A lot of times, she wouldn’t even get as far as the door [by] her own choice.” According to Jan’s nephew Jeff Hooks, “She was terrified to do [<em>30 Rock</em>], mainly because of age and weight gain and vanity and stuff like that. She also thought that maybe she had lost the edge or lost the touch, and that people were going to bash her.” But Hornaday never got the sense that Jan was bothered by her physical transformation, and Nealon agrees. He says that since Jan “didn’t really put that much importance on beauty,” her looks likely had little to do with her hesitancy about returning to work. “I think the characters and the work were more important to her, [though] I’m sure she wanted to look good. She would have preferred to be the Jan of the ’80s.”</p>
<p><i>30 Rock </i>marked a comeback of sorts for Jan, after an eight-year period in which she acted on camera only once, in Martin Short’s flop <i>Jiminy Glick in Lalawood</i>. The hit comedy introduced her to a new audience while reacquainting her with legions of longtime admirers. But after a couple of well-received <i>30 Rock</i> performances and a brief appearance in a scene that showed her burrowed beneath bedsheets on a November special titled <i>The Women of SNL</i>, Jan again shunned showbiz and retreated to Bearsville. There, she continued her recovery and occasionally drove to visit family in Atlanta and friends on Long Island and in Manhattan. But while New York City held less allure than ever, Bearsville had also begun to grow tiresome. “Even for somebody who craved solitude as much as she did, she was feeling a little too isolated,” Hornaday says. “She really just never found her tribe there.” Except for one more gig, a 2013 voice-over on <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, Jan never acted again — not even for fun.</p>
<p>In January 2014, Tony Award–winning composer and erstwhile <em>SNL</em> piano man Marc Shaiman called Jan to say that he and her former costar Nora Dunn were planning a reunion of the Sweeney Sisters. The wonderfully cheesy lounge act, dreamed up by Jan and starring her and Dunn, had spawned one of Jan’s most memorable <em>SNL</em> characters. The <a href="http://www.newyorkpops.org/" target="_blank">New York Pops</a> were planning a tribute to Shaiman at Carnegie Hall, and the Sweeneys — hopefully with Jan — were slated to perform. “In character Jan and I knew exactly who [we] were without discussion,” Dunn later wrote on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nora.dunn.35/posts/4694043845364" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. “It happened on its own. As Liz and Candy we shared an uncomplicated bond and an enduring sisterly love. The fact that they became a hit was secondary to the joy of being them. We opened the Emmy&#8217;s in [1988] and back stage we decided to chat with George Will and Sam Donaldson in character. They shunned us as if we were two backstage barflies trying to slut it up with a couple of genuine prime time newsmen. No one enjoyed something like that more than Jan Hooks.”</p>
<p>The reunion wasn’t to be. “I called and said, ‘What would be more brilliant than you girls singing “Clang! Clang! Clang!” [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3sNwccHxI" target="_blank">“The Trolley Song”</a>] at Carnegie Hall, where Judy Garland first did it in her famous medley?&#8217;” Shaiman says. Jan waffled and asked for time to think it over, but Shaiman already knew the answer. “The writing was on the wall,” he says. “I gave her a month and called her back, and she said, ‘No can do.’ And I said, ‘That audience will love you! And we can put it in any key — do whatever you want to make you comfortable.’ But she just couldn’t imagine herself doing it.” Jan may also have been influenced by Hornaday, who expressed concern about Jan’s returning to the live stage in such a “high-stakes context” with “so much baggage and so much pressure.” “On the other hand,” Hornaday says, “I know it would have been wonderful and lovely, but she had so many misgivings.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he same month Shaiman accepted his Carnegie honor and on the cusp of five cancer-free years, Jan discovered a bump the size of a pencil eraser on her throat. After an initial examination at Kingston Hospital in upstate New York, she was directed to the Dyson Center for Cancer Care in Poughkeepsie for more tests. Based on a biopsy of her tumor, Jan’s physician recommended she visit a larger facility — either Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City — to have the results evaluated. With Tom’s help, she booked an appointment at Sloan Kettering, where doctors explained Jan’s prognosis and treatment options.</p>
<p>As the weeks wore on, Jan’s voice grew increasingly hoarse, until it was nothing more than a low croak that she joked made her sound like the brassy, 1960s TV star <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9sKQo5Inno" target="_blank">Rose Marie</a> “on testosterone.” Thanks to the iPad she’d received from Tom, who had also bought his technophobe sister her first and soon virtually useless cell phone earlier that summer, Jan quickly became proficient with email and began firing off elegant, witty, sarcastic missives to a small circle of pals. “I was just kind of floored at what a great writer she was and how articulate she was in her email letters,” Nealon says. “And I thought, <em>Wow, this is a side of Jan I never saw before</em>. I’d seen birthday cards and things like that, where she’d write a line or two, but these were from a really thought-filled, educated woman.” As revealed in dispatches to Wenzel Jones, a friend of Jan’s since the late ’70s when they did summer stock theater together on a Native American reservation in Livingston, Texas<strong>,</strong> she maintained a sense of humor despite her mounting misery.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>August 9</strong><strong>:</strong><a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="20" href="#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;One day after her first appointment at Sloan Kettering.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-20">20</sup></a> They made me drink this red Kool-Aid stuff which, they say, makes me radioactive for 3 days. I was actually ordered to have no contact with pregnant women &amp; infants. DAMN IT!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>August 12:</strong> As if there weren’t enough to be depressed about. Cozi TV has stopped showing reruns of ‘The Real McCoys.’ I just loved Luke &amp; Kate &amp; Grandpappy Amos. Although I was kind of confused by the family dynamic. Little Luke was Big Luke’s brother and Hassie was their sister. Where were their parents? And why did they give their 2 sons the same first name??? Anyway, my point is… WHEN WILL GOD STOP BEING SO MEAN?????</p>
<p><strong>August 14: </strong>I’m still trying to navigate my way around this necessary but heartbreaking device [her computer]. I am more and more embarrassed by my voice. I sound like Rose Marie on testosterone. So I must depend on this foul machine to communicate. Any help or advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>August 16:</strong> Sorry for drunk dialing you last night. Wow! I am really feeling sorry for myself these days, am I not? I really SHOULD get out of this room.</p>
<p><strong>August 16:</strong> As I told you, I ventured out today. I’m avoiding neighbors because I’m normally a pretty chatty gal, and it’s hard to lie about my creepy voice by passing it off as mere laryngitis when it’s actually CANCER!!!!!!! People get pretty scared of that. Gloomily yours, Jan’et.</p>
<p><strong>August 17: </strong>As my throat and voice get more and more scary and painful, my dependence on wine and cigarettes increases. Oh the irony! The things that soothe you mentally and spiritually destroy you physically. It’s so unfair.</p>
<p><strong>August 19:</strong> I actually was home when you called. Using my voice becomes increasingly more painful so I avoid the phone unless absolutely necessary. Therefore, I’m getting more dependent on the Magic Window to communicate. How’s that for irony?!! So let’s play through email. Tom’s coming in tomorrow night. Drs appt on Fri morn. Find out results of PET scan. Yikes!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>The results weren’t good. The lump on Jan’s neck was growing, and doctors urged her to return in early September for more tests. “What they said, essentially, was that the tumor was not chemo-sensitive,” says Tom, who took notes throughout the ordeal. “So it couldn’t react to chemotherapy. The only recommended procedure was a total laryngectomy.” Besides rendering her voiceless, the operation would cause significant disfigurement. Those were outcomes Jan could not and would not abide. “It was not a cut-and-dried thing,” Tom says. “It was, ‘This is our recommendation, but there’s no guarantee that the cancer is not going to recur.’” In light of that and for other reasons, Jan chose to forgo treatment. Although she never really explained her choice, Tom got the impression that his sister “just had this extreme fear of being admitted to a hospital and a loss of control.”</p>
<p>So Jan faced imminent death the same way she lived life: on her own goddamn terms. She and Tom made arrangements with a hospice near her home in Bearsville, and prescription drugs — along with wine and cigarettes — helped dull her intensifying pain. When Tom returned to Bearsville on October 6 to meet with hospice workers (Jan’s “angels”) and assist in finalizing his sister’s will and trust, he noticed that her breathing had grown labored (an oxygen machine gave only mild relief) and she was sleeping much more than usual. She was also eating less than before, which hadn’t been much. Even liquids were hard to swallow. When hospice workers reviewed her medication, Tom says, they told him that Jan might have only days left to live. To make her remaining time as comfortable as possible, an adjustable hospital bed was installed in the living room downstairs (Jan preferred to sleep on the sofa), and a small wheelchair was brought in if she became too weak to walk.</p>
<p>Very early on the morning of October 9, 2014, after Jan and Tom had watched (as they usually did) <em>Late Show With David Letterman</em>, Jan arose and went to use the bathroom. When she emerged, Tom was in her wheelchair and rolling around while channeling Curly from the Three Stooges: “Woo-woo-woo!” Jan laughed. Seconds later, on her way back to bed, she staggered. Then her knees buckled and she dropped to the floor, limp. Tom rushed over and tried to lift her, but she was too heavy. “Come on, honey, get up,” he said. “Damn, you’re dead weight.” Unable to get her off the floor, he fetched a pillow and bedspread, eased her onto them, and waited for her to revive. She never did. A bit after 1 a.m., she stopped breathing. The oxygen machine was still going strong. “I couldn’t find a pulse and just thought, ‘Damn, this is it,’” Tom says. “So I held her hand, told her I loved her and promised to take care of things. And, of course, I wept.” When the hospice nurse on call arrived roughly an hour later, she officially pronounced Jan’s death.</p>
<p>“You knew it was coming,” Tom says. “My big fear was what the doctors were saying: This [cancerous bump] is going to keep growing, it’s going to close up the airway, she’s just going to rasp and essentially strangle and you can’t do anything — you can’t put a [tracheotomy tube] in. It was just like, Oh, my god, that would be awful. And that didn’t happen. Thank god that did not happen. She was laughing and sort of talking right up to the end.”</p>
<p>As word spread online that Jan had died, Tom and his cousin Susan, both Georgia residents, fielded questions from the press but kept details of Jan’s health and the cause of her death private — which only sparked curiosity about what might have befallen her. Soon newspapers, newscasts, and the Internet were packed with tributes. There was also an outpouring from heartbroken fans who took to blogs, social media, and comment sections to express their sadness and appreciation. “She absolutely brought <em>Saturday Night Live</em> out of its dark hole and paved the way for the strength of today’s women comedians,” one fan <a href="http://www.liteseyfh.com/fh/print.cfm?type=tributes&amp;pg=1&amp;printall=1&amp;o_id=2750490&amp;fh_id=12186" target="_blank">wrote</a>. Famous admirers, including comic superstars Amy Poehler and Amy Schumer, joined in. “I was 15 years old when I first saw Jan Hooks on ‘SNL,’” Poehler said in a statement. “All of her characters spoke to me. She was one of the greats.” Schumer <a href="https://twitter.com/amyschumer/status/520448523490578432" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: “Jan Hooks made me laugh so hard so many times.”</p>
<p>Worried that paparazzi would descend on Cedartown for Jan’s funeral, Tom implored the family and friends who were invited to keep their mouths shut and refrain from divulging any details about Jan’s upcoming service. Even though the funeral home “publicized the funeral without permission,” much to Tom’s chagrin, nothing came of it and preparations continued for a private ceremony on the afternoon of Friday, October 17.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">“S</span>he was a very spiritual person who loved her angels and saw relationships between things that the rest of us missed,” Tom said of Jan in his introduction at Northview Cemetery. “For example, butterflies and stars represented people she loved. So Jan was spiritual but not religious. She wasn’t antireligion, though, thank god, so we’re hoping for a smooth mix of both prayer and profanity today.” So Jan’s cousin Beth read selections from the Bible, and then Tom began his eulogy: “Fifty-seven years ago, a pretty little baby girl arrived in the world. Her older brothers were a couple of knuckleheads, but they were proud of their new baby sister — until they noticed that Mommy obviously liked the new baby best.”</p>
<p>At this point, Tom was joined by his son Jeff and cousin Susan.</p>
<p>Susan: “Stop making so much noise and go outside! You’ll wake the baby!”</p>
<p>Jeff: “But Mommy, it’s cold and it’s raining!”</p>
<p>Susan: “Out!”</p>
<p><em>And &#8230; scene.</em></p>
<p>Tom’s speech went on like that, with brief musical interludes, covering Jan’s childhood, high school years, and professional accomplishments, the latter of which were given short shrift. “We’re family, and we knew the real Jan, not just the performer,” Tom said. “Yeah, she had a lot of great attributes. She was brilliant, creative, and hilarious. But let’s face it, she wasn’t a saint.” (Here, Tom patted the lid of Jan’s casket and quipped, “Sorry, kid.”) “As gifted as she was,” Tom went on, “Jan could be moody, self-centered, isolated, or — insert your favorite adjective here. I was sad that she remained so secluded. Most of us haven’t heard from her in years. But you know, maybe we can learn a lesson from that. If you’re feeling bad or lonely, please reach out. There are a lot of people right here that love you.”</p>
<p>Now it was time to lighten things up and play with props, which included Jan’s local Emmy (she always complained about how cheap it felt), a pillow from her guest room embroidered with the words &#8220;Rebel Princess,&#8221; and a jar of Pace Picante salsa that recalled one of her first TV commercials. Tom closed this portion of the tribute by asking everyone to participate in a brief sing-along to Judy Garland’s version of “The Trolley Song” from the 1944 film <em>Meet Me in St. Louis. </em>As a young girl, Jan had often belted the tune from her bedroom as her brothers tried to kick down her locked door and make it stop.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Clang-clang-clang went the trolley!<br />
</em><em>Ding-ding-ding went the bell!<br />
</em><em>Zing-zing-zing went my heartstrings!<br />
</em><em>From the moment I saw him I fell!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>When the applause and laughter subsided, the memories began. One after another, mourners told stories about Jan from childhood and holidays and travels. Tom recounted her reasons for staying single and shirking motherhood. When a nurse had broached the subject, he said, Jan told her: “If I had gotten married, I’d be in prison right now. If I’d had kids, I’d be on death row.” Concluding his comments on an upbeat note before the group filed off to a nearby “celebration of life” party, Tom asked them to “pause and concentrate a little bit” the next time they laughed, which would surely be soon. “Feel that extra little push that makes our laughter a bit more musical?” he asked. “That’s Jan. She’s laughing with us today.”</p>
<p>In a dramatic segue Jan might have appreciated, Tom then switched on a recording of “Proud Mary” that was queued up to Ike Turner’s slow, low “Rollin’ on a river” about halfway through, just before the song explodes in a flurry of horns and Tina’s driving vocals. A showstopper when Jan had performed it way back when, the tune was a fitting finale in more ways than one. The obvious musical allusion aside, its first verse could easily describe a woman who traded her sometimes-complicated life in lights for a simpler existence in the shadows, and who was at peace with that decision.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Left a good job in the city<br />
</em><em>Workin&#8217; for the Man every night and day<br />
</em><em>But I never lost a minute of sleepin&#8217;<br />
</em><em>Worryin’ ’bout the way things might have been</em></p></blockquote>

				<description><![CDATA[How Austin Rivers, coached by his father on the Los Angeles Clippers, turned around his NBA career.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap">D</span>uring the rocky beginnings of his pro career, when Austin Rivers was running low on both confidence and playing time, he would seek advice from an NBA head coach — but not the one he played for. That’s one of the benefits of being Doc Rivers’s son. Drawing on 30 years of experience in the league, Doc told Austin to get back in the gym — to stay deep into the night if necessary — and work with the future in mind. “When I was in New Orleans, I’d talk to him a lot, because he would help me through what I was going through,” Austin said. “I would be so frustrated, because I would be watching kids I used to play against and they’re in situations where they’re playing. You don’t understand how angry that made me. It was probably the darkest time of my life. Because I knew I could do it. I needed a chance.”</p>
<p>Navigating the terrain between father and son, player and coach had never been especially difficult for the Riverses throughout Austin’s childhood. Doc stalked the Boston Celtics sideline much of the year and could be an active father to his four children only during brief respites from the NBA. “I didn’t try to be the parent-coach every second of his life, but we had a lot of great basketball conversations at the same time,” Doc said. “And I think that’s always been a bonding force for us.” For the most part, Doc left his children’s athletic development to others. “He was a dad in the stands,” said Therion Joseph, Austin’s youth coach. “Because there were so few times when he actually got to see Austin.”</p>
<p><aside class="espn-boxout" id="boxout-297449"><h4>2015-16 NBA Preview</h4><a href="https://grantland.com/tags/2015-nba-preview/" target="_blank">Everything you need to know about the coming season</a>.</aside>Doc’s responsibilities as coach and father didn’t begin to overlap until Austin found himself struggling in his fledgling NBA career. The confident young player who’d been one of the top high school recruits in the nation, who then became a heralded addition to Mike Krzyzewski’s Duke lineup, was nowhere to be found for much of his time in New Orleans. “If you go two years without playing with confidence, when your whole life, you’ve been extremely confident and a hard worker &#8230; I got punched in the mouth, and it took me a while to adjust,” Austin said. “I kind of had my confidence — I don’t want to say taken away, because no one should ever be able to take your confidence away. But it wasn’t there, for whatever reason.”</p>
<p>So Austin heeded the advice from his father, who had moved on to coach the Clippers. He got back in the gym and dedicated himself to training as hard as he’s ever trained. At the time, it was just fatherly guidance — work harder — only Austin’s dad happened to be an NBA coach. Neither expected they would soon be united on the court. Austin had always imagined hitting big shots against his dad’s teams — not for them. “It’s never been done before, so why would I think that it would be done?” Austin said.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="21" href="#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Austin was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/12173377/austin-rivers-headed-los-angeles-clippers-part-trade-involving-boston-celtics-phoenix-suns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first NBA player to play for his father&lt;/a&gt;, although Coby Karl was on the Nuggets roster while his father, George Karl, was on medical leave for throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-21">21</sup></a></p>
<p>Doc is one of the league’s most revered coaches, but his moves as a decision-maker have been questioned, and his January trade for Austin generated more skepticism. Only this time it was Austin who received the brunt of the criticism. “When he first got traded, you look online, Twitter, they were killing the guy: ‘You’re a bum.’ ‘You can&#8217;t play.’ ‘Your dad is risking his career,’” Joseph said. “It was tough on him. People can always say, ‘I block out the media.’ [But] they read that stuff. LeBron [James] reads it. Chris [Paul] reads it. They claim they don’t look at it. Man, please. If they don’t read it, one of their buddies has told them about it, right? So you’ll hear about it one way or the other. If you’re human, it’s going to affect you.” Once consummated, the trade, via the Celtics, rejuvenated Austin’s career and provided highlight moments in playoff performances against the Spurs and Rockets. And now the experiment of a son playing under his father in the NBA is about to enter its first full season. The wrinkles have been ironed out. Austin is upbeat. He believes his career has been righted.</p>
<p>“I was just myself,” Austin said of his half-season in Los Angeles. “I stopped thinking. I stopped trying to show everybody I could play. I don’t need to show anybody anything. Just go be myself, and if I do that, then I can really show how good of a player I can be. I almost was mad at myself. I was so pissed that for the past two years, I’ve been putting so much pressure on myself, just for no reason.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">G</span>rowing up, there was no way for Austin to escape the shadow of his last name. Doc had been a 13-year NBA veteran, known for years as a steady, defensive-minded point guard, before he retired in 1996 and became head coach of the Orlando Magic in 1999. When Austin began playing the sport, he quickly learned how difficult his path would be, trailing in his father’s wake. He regarded himself as one of the worst players on one of his initial youth basketball teams, and outsiders were happy to agree. “Then, when people said you’re only there because of your dad, it’s almost true,” Austin said. His mother, Kris Rivers, grew accustomed to letting insults roll off her back at her children’s games, and with time, Austin learned to do the same.</p>
<p>But when he was still young, the taunts tormented Austin. “You know how angry that made me?” Austin asked. “How would you deal with it if you’re 9 years old, people are telling you, ‘You suck’? And they don’t give sympathy. They don’t feel bad for you because of who your dad is.” The pressure grew at Winter Park High School, and Austin met the challenge. He devoted himself to improving his game and wound up being a four-year starter, developing into a slashing, scoring guard while capturing Class-6A Florida state championships in 2010 and 2011. “He just had that much more athleticism than everybody else,” coach David Bailey said. “You combine that with his work ethic, you knew he was going to go far in this game.”</p>
<p>Austin finished his high school career as the nation’s top recruit, seemingly fast-tracked toward an NBA career that would surpass his father’s, but then, during his first and only season at Duke, he encountered his first significant career hurdle. The Blue Devils had captured a championship two years before Austin arrived and had bowed out in the Sweet 16 the following season. In 2011-12, Austin was pegged to lead a talented Duke squad back into championship contention, but that group struggled to coalesce. Critics suggested that the way Austin dominated the ball on offense was an important reason that team didn’t come together as well as it could have. “We just didn’t mesh as good as we wanted to,” Austin said. “I tried to do whatever I could. It was one of those things where you just have to learn from it and get better. We all took learning experiences. I could have been a better leader. Everybody could have through that whole thing.”</p>
<p>In an early-season game against Michigan State, Rivers scored just five points on 1-of-7 shooting. He had never been through a scoring slump before. Austin’s size and talent at the high school level made the game seem easy. Back then, he always handled the ball for his teams, and on possessions where he passed off to teammates, he often got the ball back. He could shoot himself out of any downturn. In college, Joseph, Austin’s youth coach, told his former pupil to be ready for change. “Duke is bigger than [one person] — this isn’t Austin Rivers, this is Duke University,” Joseph said. “That was a very good learning point for him, and once he caught on and started to understand it’s Coach K’s way or the highway, he started playing well.”</p>
<p>Austin began to turn his season around after he hit a game-winning shot against North Carolina in Chapel Hill to give Duke an 85-84 victory. Doc had watched many of his son’s games earlier in the season. The start of Austin’s college career coincided with the NBA lockout that year, allowing Doc to attend several Duke games in person. “Doc and I have our own relationship,” Krzyzewski said. “We’re very close friends and have been friends for a long time. &#8230; But Doc never tried to coach him. He tried to just be his dad, and he did a really good job of being his dad — and we&#8217;re still friends after it, so obviously he did a good job.”</p>
<p>Duke’s roster included several future NBA players that season — Austin, Seth Curry, Andre Dawkins, the Plumlee brothers — and the Blue Devils managed a 27-6 record and 2-seed in the NCAA tournament, but they were upset in the first round by Lehigh behind C.J. McCollum’s 30 points. “Anytime you’re at a place like Duke and anytime you don’t carry out your goal and expectations of going to an Elite Eight or going to a Final Four or whatever it may be, people are going to try and place blame,” said Chris Collins, a Duke assistant coach at the time and now head coach at Northwestern.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="22" href="#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Collins said he would have had trouble playing for his father, Doug Collins, who coached 11 years in the NBA. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a great thing for [the Riverses] to be able to do what they&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In my instance, personally, it would have been very tough. My dad, he never coached any of my teams, but any time he tried to instruct me, I just took it very personally. I couldn&rsquo;t separate coach and dad. Everybody&rsquo;s different in that regard.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-22">22</sup></a> “A lot of times, the players get the brunt of that. A lot of it I think was unfair. And I think Austin got that because of who he was and the kind of talent he was.” Austin had led Duke in scoring, averaging 15.5 points per game, but skeptics doubted his playmaking ability. He averaged just 2.1 assists per game. “It had nothing to do with Duke why I left,” Austin said. “I left because I wanted to be in the NBA. It’s that simple.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>hen New Orleans plucked Austin with the 10th overall pick in the 2012 draft, it was considered an ideal landing spot for the young guard. The franchise had grabbed Anthony Davis with the no. 1 overall pick, and coach Monty Williams had played with and under Doc. But Austin’s NBA dream turned into a nightmare. “New Orleans just wasn’t anything for me,” he said. “I didn’t fit in. I just couldn’t get adjusted &#8230; People think I hate Monty Williams or [general manager] Dell Demps because they brought in guys and I didn’t play that much. I don’t hate anybody. That was nobody’s fault except mine.”</p>
<p>As a rookie, Austin started the season opener in place of the injured Eric Gordon, but after nine games he lost his starting spot to Roger Mason Jr. Austin appeared uncomfortable as New Orleans tried to transform him into a point guard. “You could just tell by his facial expressions,” said Austin’s older sister, Callie. “He would always look to pass first, and you could just see hesitation in his shot,” Joseph said. “When he was in New Orleans, he just wanted to get on the floor so bad that he forgot what got him there. The game is so competitive, and if you’re thinking, <em>Should I shoot? Should I penetrate?</em> you’re going to get killed.” This time, Austin could not shoot himself out of any slump. His 5.9 Player Efficiency Rating ranked among the worst in the league. “When I did get minutes my rookie year, it wasn’t in a position that I wanted to be in,” Austin said. “Really, I didn’t get the shots I wanted. Everything was like four or five seconds on the shot clock. I had to make a play. It was so tough for me, and at the time, I wasn’t ready.”</p>
<p>New Orleans revamped its backcourt that offseason, trading for Tyreke Evans and Jrue Holiday. “That’s tough,” Austin said. “You’ve got guys that have been in the league for four, five years, all signed [to] heavy deals. I’m just a sophomore coming back off of injury.”<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="23" href="#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Rivers broke his wrist late in his rookie season and missed the final 20 games.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-23">23</sup></a> Austin started just four games his second season and played fewer minutes than he did as a rookie. “It’s a tough spot for a young guy, especially when you work as hard as he does,” Monty Williams <a href="http://www.nola.com/pelicans/index.ssf/2013/11/new_orleans_pelicans_coach_mon_10.html" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Times-Picayune</em> in 2013. “We play the guys that are going to help us win. That’s the bottom line. I’ve got to do my job. So I can’t worry about all that other stuff.” Austin turned his efforts to defense, scrounging for a way into the rotation — anything to get on the court and prove his worth. “I’ve been a scorer my whole life, so you know how hard that was for me to say?” Austin said. “I was like, ‘I don’t care. I will defend.’ I started getting like 15 minutes a game just playing defense.”</p>
<p>Midway through last season, Austin’s third in the NBA, the Pelicans traded him to the Celtics. Austin doesn’t hold a grudge over his time in New Orleans. “He taught me a lot, just in becoming a better player and a better professional,” Austin said of playing for Williams. But he had felt ready for a new start anyway, and Boston was a place where his father had earned a championship. Then, not long after he arrived in Boston, Austin received a phone call from his father.</p>
<p>Doc, serving the dual role as Clippers coach and general manager, had known many players who faltered early in their NBA careers before eventually finding stability, and he believed that the ones who made it usually relied on their deep connection to the sport to persevere through their initial struggles. “Give me any kid that has an amazing amount of love for what they do and a lot of passion for what they do,” Doc said, describing this type of player. “Usually, those are the ones that work out.” He knew his son fell into that category. When Doc was coaching the Celtics against the Lakers in the 2008 and 2010 NBA Finals, Austin chose not to attend most of the games because cheering on his dad would have interrupted his AAU schedule.</p>
<p>When Doc reached out to Austin last season, he knew he’d be accused of nepotism if he traded for his son. He also knew he could deflect those accusations, and he believed he knew how to wring the most potential from Austin. “But I didn’t know if I wanted to,” Doc said, looking back on the decision. “You didn’t want to risk that relationship or the relationship with your family.” Doc added that he also felt concern over how the Clippers roster would perceive the move. “I didn’t know how that would go,” he said. “[But] when you get in there and you start doing it, you realize the team part is easier: At the end of the day, can he help the team?”</p>
<p>The Clippers had lacked a productive backup point guard ever since Darren Collison had left the team in free agency, so Doc, prodded by his staff, concluded that Austin could benefit the team. Before going through with the decision, however, he needed to consult the rest of the tight-knit Rivers clan. “To be honest, I didn’t think it was going to be the best idea in the world,” Austin’s sister, Callie, said. “I was really nervous for how it was going to look and how people were going to portray it, but then [Doc] kind of explained to me that he had the support of the team and his staff was actually pushing him to do it.” Doc’s wife, Kris, said she agreed with the move from the onset. “From a mother’s point of view,” she said, “there’s nobody I trust more than my husband with my son, in terms of making him a better player.”</p>
<p>So the Clippers and Celtics agreed to a three-team deal, with Austin moving teams before ever playing for Boston. Over the years, Doc had heard people label Austin as cocky. He thought confident was a more accurate description, and Doc believed that Austin needed that extra reserve of confidence to endure the additional criticism that he would receive as the son of a prominent former player and NBA head coach. “Being my son, there’s more of a microscope on him at times,” Doc said. “When he doesn’t play well, I felt it was clearly written about. I think that’s the life that unfortunately he’s had to live, under that scrutiny.”</p>
<p>Soon after completing the trade, Doc summoned Austin into his office in Los Angeles. He told his son to block out everything else and listen to him: “You’ve got two options here. You are either going to play well and people are going to be like, ‘All he needed was a chance to play and a system where they gave him a chance.’ Or you could be shitty. And people could be like, ‘This kid’s a bust.’ It’s your choice.”</p>
<p>&#8220;What the heck?&#8221; Austin recalled thinking.</p>
<p>“I believe you can be the first player,” Doc continued. “That’s why I brought you here. You will only be the other way if you keep doing the shit you’re doing. Stop fucking thinking. Just be yourself, like the guy you used to be. You used to be almost too cocky in high school and college. I want that Austin. Be that guy. Believe in yourself.”</p>
<p>Austin’s new teammates trusted Doc, who had led the Clippers franchise through a 2014 postseason marred by distraction and anger over former team owner Donald Sterling’s racist comments. And if there happened to be any raised eyebrows among the Clippers players, they were lowered when father chastised son at his very first practice with the team.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t care if I’m his son,” Austin said. “If I do bad stuff: ‘Get on the bench.’ He says shit to me that he says to other players. I think that surprised other players. Because when I first came there — <em>Aw, it’s the coach&#8217;s son.</em></p>
<p>“And I don’t take it personal,” Austin continued. “Once I got my shit going and I started playing well, he’d be like, ‘Get in the game.’ And players won’t be able to say nothing, because they know I earned it.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>ustin had moments in the regular season after joining the Clippers. He dropped 28 points in a late-February game against Sacramento, but he looked past it. “That game wasn’t a click for me,” Austin said. “It was just like I was hot. I can score, so I got hot.” Later on in the season, while playing against the Knicks, Austin said he began to feel the game slow down, that sense NBA players get when their basketball minds and bodies adjust to the speed of the game and they stop thinking and just react. Austin made his passes and took his shots in rhythm. He hit nine of 10 from the field, but just as importantly, he defended well and doled out three assists. He was figuring out how to contribute more than just points to the Clippers’ cause. As Chris Paul’s backup, Austin couldn’t always count on the minutes or touches to score big. But he was learning how to affect the outcome of games regardless of how many times he put the ball through the basket.</p>
<p>Austin also adapted to the Clippers’ easygoing vibe. “On the plane ride in New Orleans, players hardly ever joked,” said Austin’s youth coach and confidant, Therion Joseph. “They didn’t really play rap music. They didn’t play cards, because that was the culture in New Orleans. So when he got to Los Angeles, [Doc] never asked what you did last night. He don’t care. He just asked that you be ready for the game.” Austin’s veteran teammates taught him how to play freely under Doc, whose stern approach to the game sometimes conflicts with the style and flair that Clippers like Jamal Crawford — and Austin Rivers — often bring to the game. The sight of Doc shaking his head on the sideline after he watches Crawford shake and bake on the court is familiar to Clippers players and fans alike. “Coach is all over him,” Austin said. “He’ll look at the bench and just be like [<em>shrugs his shoulders</em>]. So when you start to think like that, it just makes the game more fun. And when you have fun, you play better. When you play better, you get your confidence. When you get your confidence back, it starts becoming consistent. That’s all it is. It’s not rocket science.”</p>
<p>By last season’s playoffs, Austin felt as though he were transforming into the player he had been in high school and college. He converted seven of eight shots in a pivotal Game 4 win that evened the Clippers’ first-round series against San Antonio. And when Paul was forced to miss the start of the Western Conference semifinals with a strained left hamstring, Austin’s role increased further. Austin had seen backups step in for injured teammates, but he said most had not raised their game to meet the occasion. “A lot of guys just did what they [normally do],” Austin said. “This is an opportunity for me to really show people — I don’t mean to curse, but I can <em>fucking</em> play, man. Whether they’ve been giving me credit or not because I’ve been playing with my pops, I don’t give a fuck. This is basketball. This is team versus team. This is the opportunity for me to come in and play and that’s all I looked at it as.”</p>
<p>Paul approached Austin with some wisdom before the Houston series began. “Don’t try to come in and do what I do,” Paul said. “Don’t try to be me. You can’t be me.”</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like much of a pep talk. “Well, <em>shit</em>,” Rivers recalled thinking. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>Then Paul continued: “But I can’t be you. I can’t do some of the things you do. Just be yourself. See what happens.”</p>
<p>What happened was Austin sinking four of six 3-pointers and scoring 17 points in a Game 1 win over the Houston Rockets. For Austin, it felt like a validation that hardly anyone besides himself and his father expected he’d find in the NBA. He recalled the feeling during and after that game: “What have I been stressing about this whole time?”</p>
<p>In Game 3, Austin scored 25 in a Clippers blowout. Paul had returned to action by then, and during a moment of downtime, with the game already out of reach and Los Angeles looking at a 2-1 series lead, the star point guard mentioned to Doc: “This is one time where you can be Dad and not just Coach.”</p>
<p>“That part was really strange to me, and the fact that I really did look at [Austin] as a player,” Doc recently said. “Clearly, I was thrilled when he played well. But it’s funny, I’m thrilled when Chris Paul plays well and Blake [Griffin] plays well. Yeah, there is fatherly pride.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>here will probably always be opponents who taunt Austin by saying he’s in the NBA only because of his father, and even though he’s heard it all so many times, the accusation still evokes strong feelings within him. “Don’t say that and then have a kid yourself and get mad when people tell that to your own son,” Austin said. “If anything, it’s harder for me to get here. Because [if] you’re born and given everything, a lot of kids don’t have that drive to get to this level. I’m not saying it’s harder than a kid in the hood. I’m not saying anything like that. Everybody has different backgrounds or different stories. You can look at stories like Jimmy Butler and where he came from, which is incredible.</p>
<p>“I’d be like, ‘What if your kid’s really good in high school and everybody’s shitting on him, telling him, you’re only here because your dad is this and this?&#8217;” Austin continued. “‘Because that’s what you just did with me. But I deserve to be here. I deserve to be on the court right now. I earned these minutes. I just had 20-something last game, but I’m only playing because of my dad? My dad didn’t put that ball through the hoop. My dad didn’t give that assist. I did that. He’s giving me the opportunity. He’s the coach. Just like your coach is giving you an opportunity.’”</p>
<p>For Austin, pushing back against charges of nepotism may be a never-ending struggle, but it doesn’t feel like a lost cause. “I guarantee you, in high school, people would say stuff to Stephen Curry: ‘You’re only here because of Dell,’” Austin said. “Ain’t nobody in the world would say that to Steph now. He’s the MVP of the league. So you can prove people wrong.” He laughed at the notion that all he’d have to do to silence all doubters is replicate Curry’s MVP season. “At the end of the day, I’m not going to base my career and my feelings off of how other people think,” Austin said. “That’s what a coward does, to be honest. You’d look like a coward looking back 20 years from now, like, ‘I could have been great, but people were so hard on me.’ What kind of shit is that? I&#8217;ve been blessed with ability. I’m thankful every day. I’ve worked my tail off. I’m going to not be confident or worry?”</p>
<p>Last season, confidence alone wasn’t enough for the Clippers, who collapsed in their playoff series against the Rockets. Austin’s hot start fizzled after Game 4 and he shot a combined 6-for-23 over the last three games, consecutive losses that allowed Houston to recover from a 3-1 series deficit. This season, Austin is looking to become more consistent. He has worked specifically on his midrange game. “If you look at the Rockets series, I hit 3s and I got to the basket,” he said. “I got and-1s. There’s no midrange area. I hit a couple fadeaways here and there, but if you look at all the great players in the game, they have a nice midrange game, especially at the guard position. Chris [Paul] is unbelievable at midrange. [Russell] Westbrook has a stop-on-the-dime midrange. Kyrie Irving can shoot from anywhere, but he shoots midrange. Dwyane Wade has a midrange. You can go down the list.” He spent chunks of time with Clippers assistant coach Sam Cassell, known during his playing career for crafty shotmaking all over the court. “This season you’ll see the guy that I know I can be,” Austin said. “That was a glimpse, in my opinion, of what I know I can do. I feel like what I did in the playoffs, I can do 82 games. That doesn’t mean I&#8217;m going to score 25 every night or 22 every night. There will be nights when I score six, but I’ll lock somebody down. I want to play on both sides of the ball.</p>
<p>“People were chanting my name in the arena last year when I played well,” Austin added. “I bet you some of those fans might have been saying other things a month earlier. I’m not saying they did, but I don’t know. I don’t ever take the highs or the lows. I&#8217;m going to keep hooping.”</p>
<p>Austin re-signed with the Clippers this summer, inking a two-year deal with an option to leave after this season. He is eager to run with Lance Stephenson, the wing recently acquired from Charlotte who might be trying to revive his career the way Austin once did. But Austin would have left already if a better opportunity had presented itself, and his father would have encouraged him to do so. “This is a business,” Austin said. “I view him as a coach and me as a player. He would have told me to do the same thing. We talked about this a couple of weeks ago: ‘I know what you can do and the way you’re going to play this year.’”</p>
<p>But even though father and son are resigned to treating the NBA like the workplace it is, Doc has relished the opportunity to see Austin on a consistent basis and have many of his children living within an hour’s drive of Staples Center. Callie lives in Southern California and the youngest Rivers brother, Spencer, plays basketball at UC Irvine. “Y&#8217;all gotta understand, he coached Boston my whole childhood,” Austin said. “I lived in Orlando, so he was not there. He was in Boston. So he’d just call me up: ‘How are you doing? How’s your game?’ He didn’t know who I was dating, trouble I’d get into. He didn’t know any of that. That’s fine with me. I love basketball so much, and so does he, that it made us have a connection.</p>
<p>“He’s on me all the time, and it’s nice to have a coach who views you like that, let alone a father, so it’s just good to see him more,” Austin continued. “Usually, when you’re younger you’re together, and older is when people go their separate ways. We were all separate younger. Now we’re all together. It’s different and it’s pretty cool.”</p>
<p>Building that type of relationship, Doc learned, should be his goal with every player.</p>
<p>“If you want to be a good coach, that’s the point you’ve got to [reach] with every single player, that the player believes the coach has his back,” Doc said. “And if that happens, I think you can unlock the freedom key with that player &#8212; that player will then play free &#8230; So I’m learning lessons from this relationship. Not just with us, but I’m learning lessons as a coach as well.”</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The Dallas Mavericks opened the vault for Wesley Matthews in free agency, but before the shooting guard can prove his worth, he must battle back from a torn Achilles.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>esley Matthews sprinted down the right sideline, cradled Damian Lillard’s outlet pass, and spotted Dirk Nowitzki. It was early March and the Portland Trail Blazers were engaged in a sluggish back-and-forth with the Dallas Mavericks. <em>I’m going to swing on the rim</em>, Matthews said he thought upon seeing Nowitzki between himself and the basket. <em>There’s no way he can keep up with me in transition</em>. He hoped his impending dunk would rouse the home crowd and build some momentum for Portland, a team jockeying for position in the crowded Western Conference playoff race. Matthews planted his left foot, a move he had performed countless times, in an effort to change directions and beeline toward the hoop.</p>
<p>The dunk never happened. Instead, Matthews collapsed. He felt like he had been kicked in the back of his ankle. The ball bounced away and play continued, the TNT cameras following the action. Matthews’s durability had earned him a reputation as one of the NBA’s iron men. When he&#8217;d go down, he&#8217;d always get back up. He&#8217;d played through the pain of hip flexor strains, ankle sprains, and knee hyperextensions. “I can’t remember the last time [before March] I saw him go down,” said Mavs assistant Kaleb Canales, who spent years coaching Matthews in Portland. “But when he goes down, he pops back up. That’s what he usually does, so I knew that there was a strong chance that this was a big injury.” Pam Moore, Matthews’s mother, was watching at home in Wisconsin and immediately worried when she didn’t see her son hustle back into the play. Now she was glued to her television screen, waiting for the replay that would confirm her worst fears.</p>
<p>Before he fell all the way to the floor, Matthews was already looking back. <em>Who the hell kicked me? </em>But there was no one behind him. He knew then that he had felt the pop every player dreads, and the thought raced through his mind: <em>You just tore your Achilles</em>. He would spend much of the next hour futilely attempting to convince himself otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Maybe it’s just a couple of ligaments</em>. <em>Maybe it’s partial. Maybe it’s my ankle.</em> But Matthews’s attempts at rationalization could not drown out reality. Deep down, he knew what the MRI would reveal long before doctors explained the results to him, in the bowels of the Moda Center. The Trail Blazers’ billionaire owner, Paul Allen, left his courtside seat to check on Matthews. Neil Olshey, the general manager, entered the room. The immediate shock of the injury began to wear off, giving way to even more disturbing thoughts about Matthews’s future. <em>Why now? I’m having the best year of my career. Our team is a championship contender. Contract year. Was I in line for a huge payday? Absolutely. Was it deserving? Absolutely. Will it happen? I don’t know. </em></p>
<p>Matthews had good reason for concern: The track record for players trying to return from Achilles tears is grim. Some never play another NBA game. Kobe Bryant blew out his left Achilles two years ago at the age of 34, but subsequent unrelated injuries have made it difficult to evaluate the success of his comeback. Elton Brand, Chauncey Billups, and Christian Laettner each sustained the injury and never again looked like the players they’d been before the tear.</p>
<p>Matthews addressed the media the night of his injury. At the time, he feared that the close bond he’d developed with the Trail Blazers and the team’s fans might never be the same. “It’s disbelief, you know?” Matthews told reporters. “I’m sitting up there in that tube having an MRI, and I don’t hear noise, I don’t feel my Achilles, I’m just … I can’t believe I’m up there while my team’s battling. I just haven’t processed all of it yet.”</p>
<p>Matthews returned home and took a long shower, his mind wandering through the possibilities of his now-uncertain future. He received a text from Bryant, who asked about his spirits and urged Matthews to find refuge in nonathletic hobbies during rehab, to read and become more knowledgeable. “It lifted me up almost immediately,” Matthews recalled. “He didn’t have to reach out, and he did — especially being somebody that you idolized, looked up to, competed against, arguably one of the best players of all time.” As an undrafted rookie with the Utah Jazz, Matthews guarded Bryant in the 2010 playoffs. “It wasn’t easy,” he recalled. “It was fun, though. I was playing hella defense, but he was making some tough shots. I’m hopeful that we get to match up again.”</p>
<p>After surgery to repair the tendon, doctors outfitted Matthews with an orthopedic boot and gave him crutches, estimating that his recovery would take six to nine months. Matthews thought about his impending free agency and reasoned that teams would consider his work ethic and toughness when deciding to offer him a contract: <em>All right, nine months puts me at November. That&#8217;s essentially the start of the season. Nine months, cut that in half: four and a half months, I should be able to do stuff. I should be able to convince people that I will be all right. People know what I&#8217;ve done. They know who I am.</em></p>
<p>Matthews also reassured himself that he had been smart with his money. “Technically, you’re safe,” he said he told himself. “Everything else is gravy.” His agent, Jeff Austin, consoled him without sugarcoating the truth. “Some teams are going to back away,” Austin told Matthews. “But we aren’t looking to sign with five teams. We’re looking to sign with one.”</p>
<p>Toronto, Phoenix, and Sacramento showed interest in Matthews despite the injury, but he turned down an offer from the Kings before signing with the Mavericks in July. Dallas prioritized Matthews in free agency, signing him to a four-year deal that stretched to $70 million once DeAndre Jordan backed out of his commitment to the team. “First, my docs played a big part,” Dallas owner Mark Cuban explained in an email regarding Matthews. “I think Dr. [Tarek] Souryal is the best in the business. So that was a critical foundation. And then there is Wes. He is driven. He is a worker. So I knew he would and has done the rehab.” For Matthews, joining Dallas has created an opportunity he hasn’t had since his high school days in Madison, Wisconsin: the chance to be a team cornerstone.</p>
<p>“I think most guys that aspire to be great, they want to be a part of something great — but not just a part,” Matthews said. “[They want] to be a factor in why it was great. And I really feel that’s why Dallas wanted me, and I feel that’s perfectly aligned with where I want to go.” Matthews knows there are people around the league who doubt his ability to make a full recovery, but as a player who entered the NBA as an undrafted free agent and then developed into one of the league’s best two-way shooting guards, he’s used to being doubted. “People want to count you out all the time,” he said. “I don’t got to look for it that hard.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>esley Matthews was not supposed to be in a position to guard Kobe Bryant. He was not supposed to earn playing time as a rookie under Utah coach Jerry Sloan. He was not supposed to be in the NBA at all, for that matter.</p>
<p>The day of the 2009 draft, Matthews couldn’t relax. He tried to ease his nerves by staying busy on draft night, heading to his high school gym to practice shooting. As dreams came true for other players, Matthews shut out the world and worked on his craft. Before long, a text interrupted his peace: The Memphis Grizzlies had nabbed Sam Young, a fellow shooting guard who’d been a projected first-rounder, with the 36th overall pick. Matthews knew what that meant: If Young was being chosen 10 to 15 spots lower than pre-draft predictions of when he&#8217;d get picked, then Matthews, projected to go between 38 and 50, probably wouldn&#8217;t be selected at all. He took more shots while the rest of the second round passed. By the time the final pick was announced, Matthews had already left the gym and returned home. Moore, his mother, hugged him. “It’s not always the best thing to be drafted,” she said. “You can be drafted in a place where there’s no need for you. We get to write our script now.”</p>
<p>In the moment, Matthews relied on some frequent advice from his grandmother: After a win or a loss, he had until midnight to feel excited or mad. When the new day arrived, it was time to bury those emotions and move forward. “So until 12:01, I was furious,” Matthews said. “I was mad. I was upset. I was every kind of emotion. But 12:01 hit, [I] got myself together, went [out] and celebrated with my friends.” It’s not as though the disappointment simply evaporated. “No one gets over something in a minute,” Matthews continued. “But the fact that you’ve committed to trying to do that — it helps.” He received a call from his agent that night. The Jazz had wanted to take Matthews in the second round but opted for a frontcourt player as insurance in case they lost a big man in free agency. Utah was interested in signing Matthews for summer league, and from that moment he pledged to make the Jazz keep him.</p>
<p>That gritty confidence was instilled by Moore. “Making sure he was just tough,” she said. “I think it really was around sports and you just carried it over: ‘You save the tears for home. You never let them see you cry.’ I think that stemmed from me trying to overcompensate for a man not being in the house.”</p>
<p>As a single parent, Moore wanted to ensure that her son would never look back on his life and ask what if. “Maybe I was too hard at times,” she said. “I don’t see too many negative repercussions with Wesley, only that sometimes it does scare me that he thinks he needs to be perfect. &#8230; He has this idea in himself that he is Iron Man. I have to remind him: ‘Wesley, that’s a fictional character.’”</p>
<p>Wes Matthews Sr. played in the NBA for nine seasons, grabbing championship rings with the Lakers in 1987 and 1988. But he wasn’t involved in his son’s upbringing. When people approach Wesley Matthews Jr. to talk about his dad’s basketball exploits, he looks at it as strangers talking about a stranger. Rather than use his absentee father as an example, Moore used her own sparkling athletic career to inspire her son. She was recruited to the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a basketball player and a sprinter, but track and field was her baby. “In that regard, Wesley’s totally different than me,” Moore said. “He’s a very team-oriented person. I was a selfish athlete. I didn’t like shortcomings of other people around me.” She became a two-time All-American and won the 1981 national indoor title with a 53.88-second finish in the 400 meters, a mark that remains a Badgers record.</p>
<p>Moore had hoped to compete in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, but the timing proved difficult. She finished her college career in ’82 and contemplated her options: She could train for the next two years, relying on her family to support her while she chased an Olympic dream that was no guarantee and could be dashed by an untimely injury. If, for some reason, she didn’t qualify for the Summer Games, what would Moore have to show for her time, effort, and energy?</p>
<p>She had already graduated college and received an offer to work for Neiman Marcus as an assistant buyer. Moore’s coach believed that she could qualify for the Olympics if she kept working and training, but her practical side won out. She wanted to support herself. “I had no one to say, ‘Pam, you can’t turn this down,’” she recalled. “And that’s why I wanted to make sure it would never happen to Wesley, because if I had to go back and do it [differently], I would have found a way to train for two more years, to see what might have been.”</p>
<p>Moore avoided the what-might-have-beens with Matthews: “I just wanted him to never have to look back.” She had him attend study sessions on Saturday mornings. When he played sports, she wanted him to train harder and smarter than everybody else. “When you have that feeling that there’s nobody out there that’s worked harder than you, that’s a feeling that takes you to the next level,” she told him.</p>
<p>Matthews routinely played against older competition growing up, and it was little surprise when he was promoted to varsity midway through his freshman year at James Madison Memorial High. There, he asked coach Steve Collins how he could help the team. Collins told Matthews to allow the game to come to him. “I wish I would have told him to take over a little bit more, because I think we ended up losing in the tournament that year,” Collins recently said. As a junior, Matthews broke his left hand in the state semifinals, and despite the injury he played in the championship. “He couldn’t even catch the ball,” Collins recalled. They lost that year, but Matthews guided Memorial to the Wisconsin championship the following season.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="24" href="#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;As impressive as Matthews&rsquo;s hardwood achievements were, soccer may have been his best sport in high school. His 69 goals scored still stands as Memorial&rsquo;s record. &ldquo;[There&rsquo;s] not many 6-5 soccer players, 190 pounds, playing forward [in high school],&rdquo; said coach Ben Voss. &ldquo;[It was] pretty intimidating.&rdquo; Voss said Matthews often jumped too high to score on headers: &ldquo;How do you work with a kid on timing and tell him, &lsquo;Hey, jump later?&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-24">24</sup></a></p>
<p>When Matthews had to decide where he’d play college basketball, Moore did extensive research. With her blessing and guidance, he bypassed the hometown Badgers — where his parents had both been stars — and chose Marquette. “In the recruitment process, it really was Wes and Pam and Pam and Wes,” said former Marquette coach Tom Crean. “You knew you were recruiting a really strong family. But at the same time, you were recruiting two teammates, because they’ve [always] been together.”</p>
<p>At Marquette, Matthews formed a three-guard lineup with Dominic James and Jerel McNeal, and the trio started nearly every game together over their four seasons. “We had nicknames,” Matthews said. “We were the kids. We were the freshmen. We were the three amigos. We were everything, but it was always all three of us together. And until my last year, I was the afterthought. Dominic was Rookie of the Year our first year. Jerel was Defensive Player of the Year as a sophomore. Third year, Lazar Hayward came onto the scene and he was a newcomer.” As a senior, Matthews’s game finally blossomed, but even though he raised his scoring average from 11.3 to 18.3 points per game, Matthews still went undrafted. Buzz Williams, who by then had replaced Crean as Marquette’s coach, tried to convince then–Utah Jazz general manager Kevin O’Connor about Matthews’s value. “I’ve never coached in the NBA, so I’m not saying I have all the answers,” Williams recalled saying. “I am saying that Wes will figure out how to get on the floor and then your coach will have a hard time figuring out how to get him off the floor.”</p>
<p>Before Matthews joined Utah’s summer league roster, a Turkish club offered him $140,000 for the upcoming season. The six-figure contract was enough to provide financial security. He thought about the money for two hours. Then he thought about his pre-draft workouts and the players he had encountered who were now preparing for their NBA debuts. “I didn’t lose a workout,” Matthews said. “One-on-one, two-on-two, three-on-three, I did not lose a workout. I had 13 of them. I just kept thinking — the money, the money, the money. Nah. I’m an NBA player.”</p>
<p>Playing with the Jazz in the Orlando summer league did not go well. He <a href="http://www.nba.com/media/magic/uta_stats_071009.pdf" target="_blank">averaged</a> 6.2 points, 1.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists in five games. More importantly, he could tell that he hadn’t made the impact on the floor required to earn a regular-season roster spot. He worried that he’d missed his shot at the NBA, but Sacramento added him to its roster for the Las Vegas summer league. There, Matthews played well enough to convince the Jazz, who were waiting for Kyle Korver and C.J. Miles to return from injuries, to offer Matthews a deal. By the end of his rookie season, Matthews found himself starting in the playoffs against Bryant and the Lakers. “We were glad to get him and he was a joy to coach, because he was a hard-nosed type of player,” said former Jazz coach Sloan. “The energy he put into play was second to none. I think he complemented his teammates pretty well, and he’s had a great career because of his attitude and the way he wants to be recognized in this league.”</p>
<p>Matthews became a restricted free agent after his rookie season. That summer, he signed an offer sheet with the Trail Blazers for five years and $34 million, but he expected Utah to match. “Every article I read, I got no indication that I was going anywhere but Utah,” Matthews recalled. “There was no way they were going to let me go. So I already had in my mind that I was going back to Utah, and I was excited about it. I was excited to play with [Paul] Millsap again and D-Will [Deron Williams] again. But [the Jazz] felt otherwise.”</p>
<p>Utah didn&#8217;t match the Trail Blazers&#8217; offer, and Matthews went to Portland. At his introductory press conference in Portland, <em>The Oregonian</em>’s Jason Quick asked Matthews if he was worth the contract. The question lingered with Matthews. “Because I had to show I was worth it,” he said. “To me, when I signed that deal, it was double motivation. When Utah didn’t match, that was Utah telling me I wasn’t worth that, and then when I signed it and I was coming to Portland, now I had to live up to it or surpass it.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">D</span>etermined to prove himself worthy of the Portland contract, Matthews found inspiration in a comic-book superhero. Not only would he play through pain and minor injury like an iron man, but he would begin thinking of himself as Marvel’s Iron Man. “You’ve seen the movies,” Matthews said. “He’s as human as everybody else. He’s had to battle stuff just like everybody else. But he figures out a way to make it work. He’s not imposing. He’s not physically dominant, but he’s smarter than everybody else. He stays up. He’s tinkering. He’s working and he gets the job done. I may catch a few people on a dunk. I may blow past a few people. I’m athletic, but I’m not a Gerald Green. I’m not a Russell Westbrook. But I can be just as effective as all of them.”</p>
<p>Matthews averaged 15.9 points and almost three 3-pointers per game last season for a Trail Blazers team that finished 51-31 before losing to the Grizzlies in the first round of the playoffs. Many around the league considered Matthews the prototype for a 3-and-D wing, a player who could stroke from range on offense and play lockdown defense, although Matthews feels the label limits him. “I think people don’t necessarily want to give me the credit of [being] a complete, solid 2-guard,” he said. “I don’t know why. I feel like for people to label me anything more than a 3-and-D would make them admit they were wrong about me.”</p>
<p>The night after Matthews’s injury, he watched Portland play from a hospital room in California. He had surgery to repair his Achilles a few days later. Afterward, doctors instructed Matthews to keep his leg elevated for 18 to 20 hours a day. He watched television. He played video games. “I started getting out of the cast, and as the weeks went on, the number of hours [of leg elevation] kind of went down, so I would try the crutch a little bit,” he said. “But I could really only stand not having my foot elevated for probably 20 minutes at a time before it would hurt.”</p>
<p>This summer, once Portland had been eliminated from the playoffs and star free agent LaMarcus Aldridge chose to sign with the Spurs, the Blazers decided to rebuild their roster. The team traded Nicolas Batum to Charlotte for Noah Vonleh and Gerald Henderson. (This move came before Aldridge had officially left the Blazers, but <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/13144136/portland-trail-blazers-agree-trade-nic-batum-charlotte-hornets-gerald-henderson-noah-vonleh" target="_blank">ESPN’s Marc Stein reported</a> that the franchise already believed it had little chance to re-sign Aldridge when it acquired Vonleh and Henderson.) Matthews didn’t even have the option to remain with the Trail Blazers, a franchise still haunted by the injury-riddled careers of Greg Oden and Brandon Roy. “Once I got hurt, everything about Portland kind of shifted,” Matthews said. “Especially that we didn’t sustain winning and we dropped off the way we did. I think that not only [Aldridge] moved on, but Portland moved on from us as well — when I say Portland, I mean management and the decisions they wanted to make.”</p>
<p>In Dallas, Matthews had hoped to form a Western Conference contender alongside DeAndre Jordan, Chandler Parsons, and Dirk Nowitzki. Of course, that was not in the cards. But even after Jordan reneged on his verbal agreement to sign with Dallas and Matthews’s new team was made the butt of thousands of <a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/winners-and-losers-the-deandre-jordan-emoji-fueled-free-agency-flip-flop/" target="_blank">emoji jokes</a>, Matthews didn’t waver on his commitment to the Mavs. “There was just too much love for me,” Matthews said. “They genuinely wanted me. Just me. I wasn’t a package deal for them. They wanted to shore up two positions, center and 2-guard, and I was the 2-guard. That was a question that was heavy on me: Let’s say DeAndre doesn’t come, do you still want me?”</p>
<p>“He made his own decision and that was it,” Matthews said of Jordan’s infamous flip-flop. “Am I mad that he changed his mind? No. The only thing that I have an issue with is, I’m reaching out [and] he just didn’t hit me back. If you’re like, ‘Hey, man, I feel this way,’ it’s fine. I’m not going to hold a gun to your head and say, ‘You can’t go.’ At the end of the day, we’ve got to make the best decision. If you thought it was here and realized it wasn’t, I can’t fault you for that.”</p>
<p>Without Jordan, few NBA observers believe the Mavericks will be able to compete for a playoff spot in the always-daunting Western Conference. Matthews has spent much of his summer rehabbing in Dallas with Parsons, who is recovering from knee surgery. “We have it set that we are going to be the best wing tandem in the league and we’re not going to use these injuries as excuses,” Matthews said. Parsons recruited both Matthews and Jordan to Dallas, and he will settle for Matthews. “Throughout the whole process, he was the guy I wanted at shooting guard,” Parsons said. “Selfishly, I think he’s perfect to play alongside me, because he’s a defending, knockdown-shooting, post-up 2. I couldn’t think of another 2 that I’d rather play with. Obviously, James Harden’s very good. Klay Thompson’s very good. But for my game and our offense and our team, having us on the wings together is a pretty great combination.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>eing sidelined last season was harder for Matthews than any obstacle he has faced on the court. “[Basketball]’s been everything to me,” he said. “Not only playing the sport, because I love it, but it brings my family together and gives them so much excitement. Being an only child, that’s what they had to look forward to. They would come to my AAU games. They would come to my high school games. They were always at my college games.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s easy to let yourself down. It’s easy to give up on yourself. [To say], ‘I don’t feel like going to the gym today.’ But when you make it about someone else — my family — I can’t justify not giving everything I have. It was tough not to be able to go out and perform for them.”</p>
<p>In mid-September, doctors cleared Matthews to run, and he hoped to participate in noncontact, five-on-zero drills by the time training camp opened in Dallas. When that deadline passed, he wanted to be ready for the start of the regular season. Now, <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-mavericks/20150928-carlisle-mavericks-are-going-to-be-patient-with-matthews-even-if-it-takes-until-christmas.ece" target="_blank">his return</a> appears even further away. “The basketball stuff, the cutting, I’m not worried about that,” Matthews said. “It’s the instinct, when that ball’s bouncing, to sprawl out extended and keep it in bounds, to make that hustle play.” Mavs head trainer Casey Smith said Matthews’s recovery depends on how his body can handle an incrementally increased workload. “The Achilles is unique in that everything you do when your foot hits the ground puts stress on the area,” Smith said. “It’s every change of direction, every landing, every jump.”</p>
<p>Dominique Wilkins is one player who can serve as inspiration for Matthews’s comeback. At 33, he returned from a snapped right Achilles to regain his All-Star form and average 29.9 points per game. “When I came back, people had their doubts,” <a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/in-their-own-words-how-nba-stars-deal-with-achilles-injuries/" target="_blank">Wilkins told Grantland</a> after Bryant ruptured his Achilles in 2013. “People said I was done and [that] my career was over. Going through my rehab, literally every day for nine months, I came back and had my best all-around season of my career. It just depends on the person and how driven they are.”</p>
<p>That is one area Matthews doesn’t have to worry about. “He’s one of the best system players in the entire league,” said Dallas coach Rick Carlisle. “I viewed him as one of the stars of their team in Portland. We want to get him healthy and we want to integrate him to be that kind of star on our team. And we will get there and he will get there. But we’ve just got to make sure we don’t skip any steps when it comes to the process of his rehabilitation and reconditioning.”</p>
<p>Matthews, who once played in 250 consecutive games before being forced to sit with a hip injury, takes his Iron Man nickname seriously. His emphasis now is on moving forward and not suffering any setbacks. “He and I had that conversation the other day,” Smith said, referring to Matthews’s return to live game action. “It’s not going to be a situation where I watch him and say, ‘OK, you look great, you’re ready to go.’ He’s got to feel it and be comfortable with it.” When that time comes, Matthews will be back on the court, confident as always.</p>
<p>“My body of work speaks for itself,” Matthews said. “If people put my numbers next to other people at my position who they deem are the top, and you just showed the numbers, I’m sure people would be surprised to see it’s my name and not someone else’s. I don’t have anything to prove. I’m just excited to go out there and show.”</p>

<p>The Kansas City Royals&#8217; odyssey to the 2014 World Series ran parallel with the equally improbable journey of SungWoo Lee. A die-hard Royals fan who lived in Seoul, SungWoo had not only charmed the faithful in a visit to Kansas City in the summer of 2014, but he also seemed to spark the team to the run that took it to the postseason. This film takes us from Kansas City to South Korea and back again on the eve of the World Series as our filmmakers try to convince SungWoo&#8217;s bosses to let him come to the Fall Classic. It&#8217;s a tale of two cultures linked by social media, but more than that, <em>#BringBackSungWoo</em> is a moving tribute to a game that shrinks the world.

				<description><![CDATA[Why rising USMNT striker Jordan Morris chose college soccer over the pros.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="drop-cap">O</span>n the first day of the fall quarter at Stanford University, Jordan Morris walks into his Introduction to Earth Systems class, finds a seat near the back of the lecture hall, and starts flipping through his syllabus. His long summer is over.</p>
<p>In some ways, it ended just a few days ago, on the field at Gillette Stadium, where he and the rest of the United States men’s national soccer team suffered one of their most embarrassing losses in recent years. Facing Brazil in a friendly match, the U.S. back line got turned inside and out by an unending stream of attackers. Midfield fixtures Michael Bradley and Jermaine Jones appeared out of step with each other and disconnected from the game. The American attack was mostly feckless, unable to create chances until Danny Williams rocketed a ball into the back of the net moments before the final whistle sealed a 4-1 defeat. The closest thing to a bright spot in the game might have been 20-year-old Seattle native Morris, who replaced Jozy Altidore in the 57th minute and looked … somewhat decent?</p>
<p>This is no revelation. <em>Somewhat decent </em>performances are not the stuff of legend. Still, it was unexpected to see Morris making threatening runs into the box and holding off defenders while looking to attack. The Brazil game capped a spring and summer that saw Morris begin working his way up the American striker depth chart and flashing the potential to become a mainstay in the USMNT lineup. There he was in San Antonio, slotting home the game winner against Mexico. And there he was in Germany, playing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zVT5pnZq5w" target="_blank">dummy that helped spring Bobby Wood</a> for a go-ahead goal against the world champs.</p>
<p>And now Morris, a college junior, is back in school, pen out on the first day of class, listening to a lecture about the age of Earth. (“It’s very, very old.”) He’s enjoying a few weeks on campus before heading to Kansas City to help the U.S. under-23 team attempt to qualify for the Olympics. Morris is a novelty — the first college player called up to the national team since 1999, the first one to score a goal since 1992. Even with the U23 team, a group composed almost entirely of college-age players, Morris is the only one who plays college soccer. The others are scattered around North America and Europe, playing for professional first teams or their youth or reserve squads. There’s Rubio Rubin, regularly scoring goals in the Dutch Eredivisie; Gedion Zelalem, on loan from Arsenal with Scotland’s venerable Rangers FC; and Matt Miazga, starting for the New York Red Bulls and looking like perhaps the best prospect in MLS. All of them could be in college. None is. And then there’s Morris, still at Stanford, and in some ways the most accomplished of them all. Only he was considered as a possible addition to the full national team’s roster for Saturday’s CONCACAF Cup game against Mexico at the Rose Bowl.</p>
<p>The college game has long been anathema to American soccer experts. The outlines of the anti-college argument are simple: Collegians train too infrequently and play weak competition. NCAA rules force them into a nonsensical schedule, playing a version of the game that barely resembles the one played by professionals. And they do all of this while their future national team opponents — young athletes from Europe, Latin America, and around the world — devote every moment of every day to developing as players, learning under top coaches and from established professionals, with many of the prospects already earning paychecks themselves.</p>
<p>They do all of this while Morris remains in this room, leaning back in his seat, listening to a lecture that references the Archean and Proterozoic eons, in a room with more students than attended his most recent Stanford match. He has the talent and the drive to be a star for his country and his future club. So what, exactly, is Jordan Morris doing here?</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kD42O8bZ2VU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he first time Morris met USMNT coach Jurgen Klinsmann, Morris was standing on Stanford’s training grounds. It was last May, and the national team had just arrived for its pre–World Cup camp. Morris approached assistant Tab Ramos, for whom he’d played with the U.S. U20s. Ramos introduced him to Klinsmann, then made small talk before dropping a casual question: Would Morris be interested in practicing with the national team?</p>
<p>“I had this moment,” remembers Morris, who tried to remain nonchalant, as if unmoved by the possibility of training with the team he’d long dreamed of joining. “Ummmmm … OK!” The next day, Morris joined the team as the players ran through training stations — touch drills, speed drills, and then a round of quick 4-on-4 games. The intensity was unlike anything he’d experienced, the ball and the bodies all moving faster than he’d ever seen. Yet Morris acclimated quickly. He already knew DeAndre Yedlin and Brad Evans<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="25" href="#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;This was before the roster was cut down from 30 players to 23. Yedlin made the final cut. Evans did not.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-25">25</sup></a> from his time at the Seattle Sounders Academy, and the other veterans made him feel welcome right away. He managed to make it through the day without embarrassment — for a college kid, a success.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, Klinsmann invited Stanford’s team to scrimmage against the USMNT. The Cardinal settled immediately into a bunker-style game plan, defending with all 10 men and looking to spring Morris — a natural burner who’s been clocked around 4.5 seconds in the 40 — on a counterattack. “When that moment comes,” Stanford coach Jeremy Gunn told his players, “they won’t be ready to handle him.” The national team scored almost immediately, and Stanford prepared itself for a long day. Yet as the game wore on, the Cardinal kept its defensive shape, and soon enough, they maintained possession long enough to work their way up the field, where Morris darted past the back line, collected a through ball, and held off the defenders before slotting a shot past Nick Rimando and into the back of the net.</p>
<p>Of the two center backs Morris beat for the goal, neither made the final World Cup roster. “I think he helped Jurgen out with that one,” says Gunn. “He made that decision a little easier.” When interviewed, Morris didn’t want to dwell on which players he’d beat for the goal. “I don’t want to gloat or anything,” he said. “I mean, for one thing, we were playing like this was the game of our lives. They’d been going through three-a-days, and now they’re playing a college team. It wasn’t a normal game situation.”</p>
<p>Later that summer, just days after Belgium had eliminated the U.S. team in the Round of 16, Morris received a call from a number he didn’t recognize. It was Klinsmann. The coach had called just to chat, making small talk and asking about Morris’s training. “I thought, <em>Huh, that’s interesting</em>,” Morris says. “That’s not the kind of phone call you really expect to get, just out of the blue.” Months later, Klinsmann called again. He was coming to Palo Alto and wanted to have lunch. So Morris, Gunn, and Morris’s father all met Klinsmann at the Four Seasons. No one was sure what to expect. “My first thought was that he was going to want to talk generally about Jordan’s future,” Gunn says. “And, of course, you immediately think the conversation is going to be, ‘If you want to play for us, you need to leave Stanford. You need to go pro.’”</p>
<p>But Klinsmann was there for something else. He told Morris he wanted to call him up to the national team. “I got in the car afterward,” says Morris. “And I just started laughing. ‘What? Is this serious?’ I really, really couldn’t believe it.” Morris traveled with the team to a friendly in the Czech Republic. He never left the bench, but Klinsmann liked what he saw from Morris in training enough to call him back in November, when Morris made his international debut against Ireland. Since then, Morris has been in the mix consistently for the United States. “I seriously think I blacked out when that happened,” Morris says of his Mexico goal. “I remember getting the ball, and I remember watching the replay that night, but I barely remember actually scoring.”</p>
<p>A powerful and instinctive player, Morris has the vision to pick out the right pass and the speed to blow past even the most athletic defenders. “He’s a forward, very simple,” Klinsmann told <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/team/united-states/660/blog/post/2017552/us-national-team-coach-jurgen-klinsmann-on-world-cuplandon-donovanjulian-green-and-mls" target="_blank">reporters</a> after calling Morris into his first camp. “He reads the game very well ahead, he sees the space in front of him and can take people on one-against-one, and at the same time he knows his path is a different one. We see the talent.”</p>
<p>Morris has the potential to develop into a fixture in the American attack in coming years, but he’s no child prodigy. Morris is already 20, older than Jozy Altidore was when he scored against Spain in the 2009 Confederations Cup. Morris isn’t even the youngest forward to play for the national team in the past year. (Rubio Rubin is 16 months younger.) And though much has been made of Morris’s performance in those pre–World Cup training sessions, in truth, he had already been on Klinsmann’s radar.</p>
<p>“We have this special kid coming through the academy,” Klinsmann <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/team/united-states/660/blog/post/2017552/us-national-team-coach-jurgen-klinsmann-on-world-cuplandon-donovanjulian-green-and-mls" target="_blank">remembered</a> Sounders coach Sigi Schmid telling him, years before Morris’s call-up. But there was one issue. Said Schmid: “He wants to go to college.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">“C</span>ollege soccer is not nearly as good of an environment for developing players as it should be.”</p>
<p>That quote comes not from Klinsmann, a noted critic of the U.S. talent development model. Nor does it come from the technical director of a foreign or club team. It comes from Elmar Bolowich, head coach at Creighton University — right now, the best college soccer team in the country.</p>
<p>The German Bolowich has devoted much of his adult life to American college soccer, winning 280 games over 22 years at North Carolina and now turning Creighton into one of the strongest programs in Division I. He enjoys the opportunity to coach young talent, and he appreciates the facilities and the job stability that the college game can provide. “It’s a good environment developing people,” he says. “You can develop leadership abilities that last long after they stop playing.” But if you want to develop someone into a world-class athlete? “The college system is not designed for that,” he says.</p>
<p>The problems are legion. NCAA rules limit college coaches to 20 hours a week with their teams during the season and eight hours during the offseason. Compare that to professional youth academies, where players devote themselves fully to athletic development, and Americans are at a disadvantage. Then there’s the college schedule: Because of the dated U.S. model of seasonal sports, NCAA soccer teams play their entire competitive season in the fall. “Nowhere in the world is soccer a seasonal sport,” says Bolowich. “Only here.” This leaves teams to cram a year’s worth of games into a three-month season, playing twice a week, often with less than 48 hours’ rest in between. “The games should be spread out,” Bolowich says. “That would allow for better recovery and better training. The way it is now, you have a really hard time during the week finding one good day when you can have a 90-minute, good, intense training session.”</p>
<p>The compact schedule influences college soccer’s rules. Instead of the global standard of three substitutions per game with no reentry, college teams are given unlimited subs. “Tactically, it takes a lot out of the game,” says the USMNT’s Alejandro Bedoya, who played at Fairleigh Dickinson and Boston College. Rather than preserving energy for the full 90 minutes, players can push themselves to exhaustion, knowing that a sub is coming soon. This tends to rob the game of its rhythm and grace, turning it instead into a battle of quickness and strength. “The tactics are, ‘Go, go, go; push, push, push,’” says Bedoya. “It’s this mentality of, ‘Let’s get an early lead, and then you can come out and rest for the next game we have to play in two days.&#8217;”</p>
<p>You could look at Bedoya, a fixture in the American midfield and a regular starter with Nantes in France’s Ligue 1, and call him proof of U.S. college soccer’s virtues. He earned a degree and then set off for Europe, well equipped to begin his professional career. Yet Bedoya can’t help but look at the youth players at his French club and feel jealous of the opportunities they receive. “I came to Europe and started to see the ways kids are training, and it’s unbelievable,” he says. “Here at FC Nantes, the school is right here on the training ground. They’re all in a professional environment at 16, 17 years old. If one day we need extra bodies, we call them in and all of a sudden they’re training with 30-year-old professionals. That’s going to make you grow and mature as a player really fast.”</p>
<p>Bedoya remembers himself as a collegian, desperate to get better but unable to train as often as he believed was necessary. “Because of the restrictions, if you wanted to train beyond the number of hours the NCAA allowed, you had to do it on your own as players,” Bedoya says. “So we’re trying to organize everyone, but guys have different schedules, and it becomes impossible.” Occasionally, he allows himself to wonder what his career might have been like if he’d joined a European academy instead. “If I had grown up in this kind of environment and had access to this kind of training, then who knows what kind of player I could have been?” he says. “I’ll never know what my ability could have been and where my career could have taken me.” Bedoya is the quintessential American soccer player — tough, hardworking, and possessed of solid but unspectacular technical skill. “What kind of technical ability might I have developed?” he wonders. “Maybe I could have been on a different route as a professional. Maybe I could have been at a club like FC Nantes at a younger age. You never know about bigger clubs, bigger leagues, bigger money. You wonder.”</p>
<p>And yet there’s another side of that hypothetical. “College was amazing,” Bedoya says. “It’s hard to imagine not having a college experience. The classes, the friends, the partying, the nights out. Maybe I would have been on a track to get to a bigger club and make more money if I had taken another route, but that’s not everything. I do feel like I was better prepared for life after soccer — even just for life in general.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he moral panic over young men skipping years of college to play professional basketball or football is absent from the soccer conversation. There’s no hand-wringing over the missed educational opportunities, no loud debate over the virtue of amateurism. By staying at Stanford, Morris is Brandon Jennings or Emmanuel Mudiay in reverse &#8212; making a decision about his own development that is, within the context of his sport, countercultural.</p>
<p>Morris decided he wanted to go to Stanford in the summer before his freshman year of high school. He’d never been on campus, but he envisioned being surrounded by brilliance and unending sun and committed almost immediately after Stanford offered him a scholarship. “Once I finally came to campus,” Morris says, “I saw that it really was everything I expected it to be. I knew I wanted to be here.”</p>
<p>Since he broke through with the national team, calls for Morris to turn pro have intensified. After the European friendlies in June, an article on Goal.com put it plainly enough: <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/66/united-states/2015/06/10/12604922/ten-takeaways-from-usas-impressive-win-in-germany" target="_blank">&#8220;JORDAN MORRIS NEEDS TO TURN PRO.&#8221;</a> The Sounders own his MLS homegrown rights, and they reportedly offered him a <a href="http://www.sounderatheart.com/2015/4/22/8470009/jordan-morris-sounders-contract" target="_blank">“lucrative”</a> contract this spring. Yet even after the attention lavished on him after his goal against Mexico, Morris decided to stay.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of people write off college soccer,” he says. “You can say it’s not good for development, but it’s situational. If you go to MLS and don’t play, are you really getting a better experience?” Morris says that joining the national team has only bolstered his confidence that Stanford was the right course for him. He credits college ball for one of his best plays with the USMNT, the dummy that set up the goal against Germany, where Morris feigned as if he were about to receive a pass, then let it roll on to Wood while turning and making a run of his own. “I learned that here,” he says. “We practice that all the time.”</p>
<p>He continues: “I consider this to be a professional environment. Maybe people don’t realize that. It’s sharp. It’s intense. I feel prepared for any situation I go into.”</p>
<p>Stanford coach Gunn, a native Englishman who moved to the States to play soccer at Cal State Bakersfield, has become an evangelist for the college game. As Morris has weighed professional options, Gunn says he’s tried to avoid pressuring him to remain in school. Yet he bristles at the notion that his star striker has suffered by staying. “There is no perfect, correct path to success,” Gunn says. “But there are certain things that you want. You want to be surrounded by great players. Jordan is surrounded by players with talent and incredible work ethic and desire for improvement. You want great support staff. You want great facilities. There aren’t 10 leagues in the world — in any sport — that provide the support staff and the facilities that we have here at Stanford. Just because something is a professional environment, that doesn’t mean it’s a high-performance environment. This is a high-performance environment.”</p>
<p>Gunn goes on: “Now, would Jordan learn great things by playing with veterans? Absolutely. We can’t provide for him a chance to train next to Neymar every day. He’s not going to get that here. But there’s a culture of success here. People wonder how he can go score a goal against Mexico and then come back to college. Well, when he comes here, he gets in line for lunch, and he’s standing between an Olympic medalist and a future top-10 NFL draft pick. There’s a culture of high expectations.”</p>
<p>Gunn becomes animated while listing Stanford’s merits, an Englishman defending the uniquely American institution of college athletics. “Let’s look at the academy model in most countries,” he says. “You’re 16, 17, 18 years old, and your entire life revolves around soccer. You’re going to school, but just barely. So you have this system, and it produces some really fantastic players. But what does it do for most of the other players? It just spits them back out. They’d dedicated their lives to soccer, but they’re still not good enough to play professionally. Now what? They don’t have many options. If you’re the club, then that’s great &#8212; all you need to do is develop a few really good players. But for society, for developing human beings, is that really something we want?</p>
<p>“I think we have something really special here in the United States. There’s always talk about how we should be copying these other countries, and in some ways that might be true. But in other ways, they should be copying us.”</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">O</span>n a Friday night this September, Morris streaks up and down the field at Cagan Stadium against the University of San Francisco, having his way with defenders each time he touches the ball. A few hundred people sit watching in the stands, many of them unaware that they’re watching a rising national team star. “So does that mean he gets to play in the Olympics or something?” an usher asks when I mention Morris to him. “I knew that there was one guy who was gone for a lot of games — I guess that must be why.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, Morris’s USMNT teammates are preparing for upcoming games against the likes of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. Meanwhile, he’s carving up the back line of a team that finished last season in third place in the West Coast Conference. He has acres of room for improvement, in his technique and positioning and, according to Gunn, his willingness to impose his will on the game. “I want to see him burst through the wall,” says Gunn. “I want to see him take command. Someday, I believe, he’s finally going to realize how talented he is.”</p>
<p>He could be in Seattle, pushing for playing time over Clint Dempsey and star Nigerian striker Obafemi Martins, or he could be in Europe trying to claw his way into a starting XI. But instead Morris is here, scoring on a header in the 59th minute before exiting play with a 3-1 win in the bag. These are the moments he has chosen. Behind him, the sun is setting the sky on fire, and before him, his friends have their arms raised in celebration of an easy win. The Cardinal football team plays USC tomorrow night. The fall quarter starts soon after that.</p>
<p>“This is an experience I’m never going to get back,” he says. “I get to be in school at Stanford. I get to live with my best friends. Every day I’m in the locker room with the guys I call my brothers. That’s the experience I’m talking about. On a professional team, you’re probably not going to have that. You’re competing for spots, contracts, and everything.</p>
<p>“It won’t be the same. It won’t be this.”</p>

				<description><![CDATA[In an exclusive excerpt from ‘The Rap Year Book,’ Grantland’s Shea Serrano breaks down ‘Still Tippin’’ by Mike Jones.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What This Song Is About</h2>
<p><em>It’s a lifestyle song, stuffed fat with meta Houston rap references and slang.</em></p>
<h2>Why It’s Important</h2>
<p><em>It turned Houston into the epicenter of rap in the months following its release. The city’s influence in rap has yet to wane.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2666.png" alt="♦" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYTBsN-KeNE</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>here were only four songs that were in contention for this chapter, but really there was only ever one.</p>
<p>The four: “Roses” by Outkast; “Drop It Like It’s Hot” by Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams; “Jesus Walks” by Kanye West; and “Still Tippin’” by Mike Jones, Slim Thug, and Paul Wall.</p>
<p>The most fun song of 2004 was Outkast’s “Roses,” a song so transfixing that you kind of forgot that Andre 3000 makes twenty-five separate references to poop in it. But “Roses” wasn’t even the most important song on 2003’s <i>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</i>. That was “Hey Ya!,” possibly the best rap song ever with an exclamation in the title.</p>
<p>The most mesmerizing song of 2004 was Snoop’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” a song so hypnotic it managed to prop Snoop atop <i>Billboard</i>’s Top 100 chart for three straight weeks, a thing that had somehow never happened during his career to that point. But Snoop had been rapping for sixty-five years<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="26" href="#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;There is a possibility this is not an accurate number.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-26">26</sup></a> by the time he released “Drop It Like It’s Hot.” He’d long been a star. It didn’t establish him. Nor did it establish Pharrell. Pharrell actually wrote for, and helped produce, Wreckx-N-Effect’s “Rump Shaker” in 1992. That’s how long Pharrell had already been around. He probably helped produce “The Star-Spangled Banner,” too,<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="27" href="#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Pharrell was seventy-five years old when he produced &ldquo;Drop It Like It&rsquo;s Hot&rdquo; for Snoop. Pharrell had come out of retirement to produce for Snoop. The man was seventy-six years old. Pharrell Williams always lied about his age. He lied about his age all the time. When I was researching for this book I talked to Frank Sinatra. I said, &ldquo;Frank, you hang out with Pharrell Williams. Just between me and you, how old is Pharrell Williams?&rdquo; You know what Frank told me? He said, &ldquo;Hey, Pharrell Williams is a hundred and thirty-seven years old.&rdquo; A hundred and thirty-seven years old.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-27">27</sup></a> if I had to guess.</p>
<p>The best song of 2004 was Kanye West’s “Jesus Walks,” a song so perfectly constructed I have to assume it is, and will remain forever, the high point of Jesus’s rap career. But it gets nixed, too, because while it was/is/will remain truly magnificent, it (mostly) didn’t accomplish anything broader than its own success.</p>
<p>The most important song of 2004 was “Still Tippin’.” It managed to not only create insta-superstars out of Mike Jones, Slim Thug, Paul Wall (and Chamillionaire, albeit indirectly), but, more permanently, it legitimized Houston as a viable rap city, which in turn led to the adoption and mutation of the city’s music styling, a sound still prominent in rap today.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>hese are some things that happened during 2004 that were memorable and so maybe you’d like to remember them:</p>
<p><b>Facebook launched.</b> That meant we were all only six years away from the Facebook movie and then from there only a few days away from a bunch of Well Actually conversations about how the Facebook movie wasn’t actually titled <i>The Facebook Movie.</i></p>
<p><b>The USA men’s basketball team lost to Argentina in the semifinals at the Olympics.</b> I blame this on Stephon Marbury. To be fair, I can’t say for certain that it was his fault America lost, but if something goes wrong in basketball or even just in life, in general it’s usually Stephon Marbury’s fault. A semi-related, 100 percent true thing: In 2003, I received an autographed Stephon Marbury basketball. By 2005, the skin on the ball had nearly completely flaked away. In 2003, I met David Robinson and he signed a separate basketball for me, too. I still have it. The skin is in perfect condition. I’m left to conclude that Stephon Marbury’s touch is enough to chemically destabilize leather. I’m also left to conclude that I was super-uninteresting in 2003 because I was apparently collecting autographed basketballs.</p>
<p><b>Lindsay Lohan starred in </b><b><i>Mean Girls</i></b><strong>.</strong> <i>Mean Girls</i> is secretly the most advanced, most powerful movie of the generation, and maybe of all time. A lot of people refer to <i>Godfather II</i> as the <i>Mean Girls</i> of the seventies. I actually heard that Lohan read for Al Pacino’s part in <i>Heat</i> but that the director was nervous about giving it to her because she was a nine-year-old girl. Ageism is real in Hollywood.</p>
<p>None of these of course have any tie-in to Mike Jones or Kanye West or any rap from 2004 or even rap music at all for that matter. They’re just some things that happened. But there’s no way I will ever write anything about 2004 without at least mentioning <i>Mean Girls.</i></p>
<p>I suppose that means I am still super-uninteresting.</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he version of “Still Tippin’” that most know isn’t the original version. The original was recorded in 2002. Both were built up from an old Slim Thug freestyle,<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="28" href="#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s from a song called &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Ho (Whodini Freestyle).&rdquo; In &ldquo;Still Tippin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Slim has a line where he mentions a Nintendo GameCube. In the freestyle, which came out years before, he mentions a Nintendo 64. I always thought that was very neat. Slim Thug likes his video game references to be timely.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-28">28</sup></a> but they had different producers (Bigg Tyme produced the original; Salih Williams produced the famous one) and different lineups (Chamillionaire was on the original; Paul Wall replaced him on the famous one). The famous version ended up on a compilation tape in 2003 called <i>The Day Hell Broke Loose 2</i>. It was then plucked from there and used as the first single from Jones’s <i>Who Is Mike Jones?</i> album in 2004 after Jones improbably proved to be a commodity.</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>his is what Mike Jones did to jump-start his career, and it’s really very smart and a fun thing to think about: At the beginning of his career — this was back around 2000 — nobody in rap would pay attention to Jones. And nor should they have. Mike Jones is a talented marketer, and he is an opportunistic businessman, but he is not that great of a rapper. And being not that great of a rapper is not a very good thing if you want to be a famous rapper.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="29" href="#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;Though, being not that great of a rapper certainly does not exclude one from becoming a famous rapper. See: Cole, J.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-29">29</sup></a> So he went to who people in rap would pay attention to: strippers.</p>
<p>He started visiting the most popular strip clubs in Houston. He introduced himself to the dancers, talked to them about music, and then he started making personalized rap songs for them to dance to onstage. He’d put a girl’s name in the song, describe her a little bit, talk her up. First it was one girl. He did it for free just to start. Then two girls. Then five girls. He started charging them for the songs. Demand grew and grew. Ten girls. Twenty girls. Eventually, all the girls in a particular club were dancing to his music. Then two clubs. Then five. He inundated the airspace with his adenoidal, unmistakable voice. What’s more, on those songs (and in the songs that came afterward) he’d repeat his name over and over again, put his phone number in them, on T-shirts, on posters, on everything.<a class="footnote-link" data-footnote-id="30" href="#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Jones released a straight-to-DVD-then-straight-to-the-dumpster movie called &lt;i&gt;The American Dream&lt;/i&gt; that was based on his life. There&rsquo;s a scene in it where his grandmother lays out what was to become his business model. She was the one who told him to do the phone number thing and the name repeat thing and the songs for strippers thing. Mike Jones&rsquo;s grandma.&lt;/p&gt;
"><sup id="ss-30">30</sup></a> He seemed to exist only to promote his brand, and that’s one way a not very good rapper becomes the most visible rapper in his city, then state, then country. He made himself unavoidable. So people stopped avoiding him.</p>
<p>Sidebar: In <i>The Facebook Movie</i>, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the guy who invented Napster, sits down for a meeting with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). During the meeting, Parker asks Zuckerberg and Saverin about marketing strategy. Zuckerberg talks about how there was one instance where they wanted to get Facebook onto Baylor but Baylor already had its own independent social networking site. So what they did was target all the schools in a hundred-mile radius and get Facebook there. Soon enough, the kids at Baylor were transferring over to Facebook. That’s basically exactly what Jones did, except instead of colleges he used strippers. All of a sudden, every stripper in the area had his music in their hands, and next thing Jones knew, it was in front of every tastemaker around.</p>
<p>In a 2014 mini-documentary that Complex.com did about the importance of “Still Tippin’,” Michael Watts, one of the cofounders of SwishaHouse, the record label in Houston that housed Slim Thug, Paul Wall, Chamillionaire, and later Mike Jones, said of pre-fame Jones: “He didn’t come as just a rapper. He came with a plan. I was really impressed because I never had anybody that came to me with a plan that [hadn’t], to that day that I know of, put out an album.” That’s the best summation.</p>
<p>Mike Jones eventually unraveled his own fame, setting fire to each rung of the ladder he used to climb toward stardom after each step. And so when his fall came, not too long after he’d watched <i>Who Is Mike Jones?</i> go double platinum, he plummeted toward the earth so fast and violently that when he struck it he was atomized on impact. He’s virtually invisible in music today. But his ascension remains a compelling story, and essential to the rise, and eventual market dominance, of Southern rap.</p>
<p><span class="drop-cap">F</span>rom 1992 to 2002, there were only two rappers from Houston who made albums that sold more than a million copies. Scarface did it in 1994 with <i>The Diary</i> and in 1997 with <i>The Untouchable</i>. And Lil’ Troy, who caught magic with his single “Wanna Be a Baller,” did it in 1999 with <i>Sittin’ Fat Down South</i>. After “Still Tippin’” was released in November 2004, it happened three times over eight months in 2005 (Jones, <i>Who Is Mike Jones?</i>; Paul Wall, <i>The Peoples Champ</i>; Chamillionaire, <i>The Sound of Revenge</i>). The exposure led to an influx of culture plumbing: the candy paint; the gold and diamond grills; the Styrofoam cups full of lean/drank, a mixture of promethazine, codeine, and soda; and most aggressively, the sound and style of DJ Screw, who pioneered the chopped and screwed subgenre of music, which was cutting up songs and playing them back over themselves while slowing everything down to an earthworm’s inching pace.</p>
<p>In a 2010 email interview with <em>The Guardian</em>, Drake wrote, “Sometimes I feel guilty for how much I love Screw and the SUC. I feel like Houston must look at me as someone who is just latching on to a movement. But I just can’t express how that shit makes me feel. That brand of music is just everything to me.” That’s the best summation.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he worst Houston impression: In 2008, T-Pain, a large top hat with an R&amp;B singer underneath it, released a song with Ludacris called “Chopped ’n’ Skrewed” where he replaced the Screwed sound with his AutoTuned sound, then used the phrase “chopped and screwed” to mean that your advances have been disregarded by a female.</p>
<p>The best Houston impression: In 2011, A$AP Rocky, a rapper from Harlem, released a song called “Purple Swag.” It was slow and sleepy but melodic and assertive. The video for the song, which went viral almost instantly, helped propel Rocky toward the $3 million record deal he ended up signing with RCA Records and Polo Grounds Music. There are two moments where a Mike Jones lift can be heard in the background: once at the 0:42 mark and once at the 2:00 mark. Each instance lasts less than a second. Still, even tucked away and hidden underneath the layered and loopy etherealness of the song, his voice is impossible to miss. Both times, it’s Jones declaring, “I said!” It’s a micro-slice of him from “Still Tippin’,” and it comes during a stanza at the end of his verse where he repeats the line “Back then, hoes didn’t want me, now I’m hot, hoes all on me” four times in a row.</p>
<p>Mike Jones is eternal.</p>
