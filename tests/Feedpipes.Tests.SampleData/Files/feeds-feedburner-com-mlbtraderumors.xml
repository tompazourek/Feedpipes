				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest from the ATL&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>While the Braves were heavily linked to the starting pitching market, GM Alex Anthopoulos told reporters (including <a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/baseball/braves-big-trade-deadline-send-message-mlb/1r2zXpxyySM0pHnacdyKkI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Gabriel Burns of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>) that the team was &#8220;never even remotely close&#8221; to landing an arm for the rotation.  &#8220;<em>At the end of the day, where we thought there were deals that made sense for us, we felt like the bullpen made the most sense</em>,&#8221; Anthopoulos said.  &#8220;<em>We definitely tried for other areas, but we obviously couldn’t line up on a deal that made sense for our organization</em>.&#8221;  Of course, the Braves already made a noteworthy starting pitching addition in June when <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/keuchda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Dallas Keuchel</a></strong> was signed, and Anthopoulos&#8217; front office heavily bolstered the pen over the last two days with trades for <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greensh02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Shane Greene</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/melanma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Mark Melancon</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=martich02,martin012chr&amp;search=Chris+Martin&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Chris Martin</a></strong>.</li>
<li>One of the starters the Braves had interest in was the biggest name moved at the trade deadline, as ESPN.com&#8217;s Buster Olney reports (<a href="https://twitter.com/Buster_ESPN/status/1156950102298247169" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Twitter link</a>) that the &#8220;Braves were in on&#8221; negotiations about <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greinza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Zack Greinke</a></strong> with the <strong>Diamondbacks</strong>.  However, Atlanta ultimately decided &#8220;it was just too pricey, and too much risk on an older pitcher.&#8221;  The Astros ended up landing Greinke <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/07/dbacks-trade-zack-greinke-astros.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">for a big trade package</a> that included four prospects and covering $53MM of Greinke&#8217;s salary obligations.</li>
<li>Speaking of the Greene deal, the Braves were able to make that trade without including catcher <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=jacksal02,jackso002ale&amp;search=Alex+Jackson&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Alex Jackson</a></strong>, as <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyfenech/status/1156985247520710657" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Anthony Fenech of the Detroit Free Press</a> reports that Atlanta turned down the <strong>Tigers</strong>&#8217; ask for the 23-year-old prospect.  Jackson is ranked as the the 26th-best prospect in Atlanta&#8217;s system by MLB Pipeline, and is in the midst of a huge season at Triple-A (.887 OPS in 283 PA).  Picked sixth overall by the Mariners in the 2014 draft, Jackson&#8217;s prospect stock dropped after a slow start to his pro career, though a position switch to catcher three years ago and this season&#8217;s hitting breakout has gotten him back on the radar.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tigers have selected the contract of outfielder <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=demeri000tra&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Travis Demeritte</a></strong> from Triple-A Toledo, as per a team announcement.  Righty <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jimened01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Eduardo Jimenez</a></strong> has also been called up from Toledo.</p>
<p>Demeritte is set for his big league debut just a day after joining the Tigers.  The 24-year-old <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/07/braves-nearing-deal-for-shane-greene.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">was dealt</a> to Detroit yesterday along with southpaw <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=wentz-000joe&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Joey Wentz</a></strong> in the trade that sent <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greensh02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Shane Greene</a></strong> to the Braves.  It marked the second time in Demeritte&#8217;s young career that he was part of a late-July deadline deal, as he was also sent to Atlanta as part of <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2016/07/braves-trade-harrell-alvarez-rangers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">a three-player swap</a> back in 2016.</p>
<p>Selected 30th overall by the Rangers in the 2013 draft, Demeritte has been an inconsistent offensive player over his career, though he had his share of decent numbers.  This includes a great stretch at Triple-A Gwinnett this season, as Demeritte posted a .286/.387/.558 slash line and 20 homers over 399 plate appearances.  While never a premium prospect, Demeritte is interesting enough to merit a look from a Tigers club that is open to all possibilities (particularly in the outfield) as it continues a rebuild.  Demeritte began his career playing all over the infield, though he has almost exclusively been a corner outfielder over the last two years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Blue Jays officially added newly-acquired outfielder <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fishede01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Derek Fisher</a></strong> to the roster, while also activating right-hander <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/thorntr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Trent Thornton</a></strong> from the injured list.  Thornton is scheduled to start tonight&#8217;s game against the Orioles.  Right-hander <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/adamja01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Jason Adam</a></strong> also had his contract selected from Triple-A.</p>
<p>It was a brief IL stay for Thornton, whose placement with inflammation in his throwing elbow was retroactive to July 21.  Acquired from the Astros for <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/diazal02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Aledmys Diaz</a></strong> last winter, Thornton has shown some flashes of promise within an inconsistent season, posting a 5.45 ERA, 9.1 K/9, and 2.22 K/BB rate over 99 innings in Toronto&#8217;s rotation.  He&#8217;ll continue to receive a long look at the Jays figure out their future pitching plans now that <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/stromma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Marcus Stroman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sanchaa01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Aaron Sanchez</a></strong> have both been dealt.</p>
<p>Adam was acquired in a minor deal with the Royals in March, though injuries have limited to just 13 1/3 total innings in the minors this season.  The righty has a 4.24 ERA, 2.87 K/BB rate, and 7.8 K/9 rate over 579 1/3 career frames in the minor leagues, working almost exclusively as a relief pitcher in the last three seasons.  Adam made his MLB debut last season, tossing 32 1/3 innings for Kansas City while posting a 6.12 ERA, as he allowed a whopping nine homers over his brief stint in a Royal uniform.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tuesday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/tempers-flare-between-reds-bucs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">enormous brawl</a> between the Pirates and the Reds has, unsurprisingly, led to multiple suspensions on both teams.  Major League Baseball <a href="https://www.mlb.com/pirates/news/pirates-reds-suspended" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announced</a> a total of 32 games&#8217; worth of suspensions for six players, as well as a six-game suspension for Reds manager <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bellda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">David Bell</a></strong> and a two-game ban for Pirates manager Clint Hurdle.  All six players will appeal their penalties, while Bell and Hurdle will begin serving their bans immediately.</p>
<p>Here is the full list of suspensions issued&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Pirates&#8217; <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kelake01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Keone Kela</a></strong>, 10 games</li>

<li>Pirates&#8217; <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/osunajo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Jose Osuna</a></strong>, five games</li>
<li>Reds&#8217; <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hugheja02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Jared Hughes</a></strong>, three games</li>
<li>Pirates&#8217; <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/crickky01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Kyle Crick</a></strong>, three games</li>
<li>Indians&#8217; <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/puigya01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Yasiel Puig</a></strong> (then a member of the Reds), three games</li>
</ul>
<p>Fines were also issued to all six players.  <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/vottojo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Joey Votto</a></strong>, Philip Ervin, and <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/willitr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Trevor Williams</a></strong> also received fines, as did players on both teams who participated in the fracas despite being on the injured list.</p>
<p>Beyond just the brawl that began when Garrett rushed from the mound to go after the Pirates&#8217; dugout, the suspensions cover a wide range of incidents during the game.  Kela received the harshest punishment both &#8220;<em>for his role in instigating the bench-clearing incident</em>,&#8221; as per the league&#8217;s official release, and for throwing at <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dietrde01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Derek Dietrich</a></strong>&#8217;s head in the seventh inning.</p>
<p>There has been no love lost between the Pirates and Reds this season, as reflected in Hurdle&#8217;s suspension.  The Pittsburgh skipper was cited for not only &#8220;<em>his Club’s conduct during the incident</em>,&#8221; but also for &#8220;<em>multiple intentional pitches thrown at Dietrich this season</em>.&#8221;  Hurdle still received less punishment than Bell, whose six-game suspension was &#8220;<em>for returning to the field following his ejection; escalating the incident with his aggressive actions; his Club’s intentional pitch at <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/martest01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">[Starling] Marte</a></strong>; and his numerous ejections this season</em>.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right-hander <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/farquda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Danny Farquhar</a></strong> has announced his retirement, via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0mMFbQgYly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">his Instagram page</a>.  Hanging up his glove after playing in parts of seven Major League seasons, Farquhar will now move into coaching, as he&#8217;ll start work next week as a minor league pitching instructor for the White Sox, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/8/1/20750455/danny-farquhar-embarks-on-next-chapter-in-baseball-life-with-white-sox" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Daryl Van Schouwen of the Chicago Sun-Times</a> writes.</p>
<p>Farquhar attempted a comeback this season in the form of a minor league contract with the Yankees, though the 32-year-old was released in June after a brief stint at Triple-A.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>When the Yankees released me, we drove across the country from Scranton to California, you have a lot of time to reflect and you realize it’s time to move on and move on to the next stage in my career, which I’ve been talking about. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for some time now</em>,&#8221; Farquhar told Van Schouwen.</p>
<p>Farquhar was able to at least get back onto a mound and end his career on his own terms, following a terrifying incident on April 20, 2018.  Farquhar had just completed a relief outing for the White Sox when he suffered a brain hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm, causing him to collapse in the team&#8217;s dugout.  After being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery, Farquhar&#8217;s life was saved, and he was fortunately able to return home less than a month later.  After sitting out the remainder of the 2018 season to fully recuperate, Farquhar received medical clearance to continue playing, which led to his minors deal with New York.</p>
<p>Originally a tenth-round pick for the Blue Jays in the 2008 draft, Farquhar posted a 3.93 ERA, 10.2 K/9, and 2.92 K/BB over 272 1/3 innings in the big leagues.  The bulk of those innings came with the Mariners from 2013-15, including an outstanding 2014 campaign that saw Farquhar deliver a 2.66 ERA over 71 frames.  Farquhar also pitched for the Blue Jays, Rays and White Sox at the MLB level, as well as stints in the minors with the Yankees and Athletics.</p>
<p>We at MLB Trade Rumors wish Farquhar congratulations on a nice career, and wish him all the best in his coaching endeavors.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a tough first season in Cleveland for Bauers, as the left-handed bat has managed just a .233/.308/.379 slash line over 383 plate appearances for the Tribe.  Acquired along with <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=santaca01,santan006car&amp;search=Carlos+Santana&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Carlos Santana</a></strong> in another big three-team swap (with the Mariners and Rays <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2018/12/mariners-nearing-acquisition-of-edwin-encarnacion-carlos-santana-indians-trade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">last December</a>), Bauers had top-100 prospect buzz surrounding him in Tampa Bay, and the Tribe were hopeful of a breakout.  While Bauers is still only 23 and could certainly still emerge in the future, his lack of production this year was undoubtedly a factor in the pennant-hungry Indians&#8217; need to acquire such notable hitting upgrades in Puig and Reyes.</p>
<p>With Bauers and Allen in the minors, Puig will slide into everyday work in right field while Reyes will likely spend much of his time at DH.  The Tribe have <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/luplojo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Jordan Luplow</a></strong> and utilityman <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/freemmi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Mike Freeman</a></strong> as backup outfield options on the bench, making Allen expendable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was once the point where we&#8217;d <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2018/08/how-august-trades-work-4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">remind everyone of the August trade rules</a> &#8212; that set of convoluted procedures by which players could still be swapped even after the &#8220;trade deadline.&#8221; Confusing as that was, it was a key backstop for contenders that saw needs arise. Increasingly, that second bite at the apple had provided a significant source of talent movement, giving teams opportunities to re-think their earlier decisions.</p>
<p>No more! We&#8217;ve already examined the new trade deadline rules in a <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/05/understanding-the-new-trade-deadline-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">detailed rulebook reading</a>. But that&#8217;s not for everyone. What you want to know is: how can my team get new players from here through the end of the season?</p>
<p>Here are the remaining ways in which players can still move from team to team the rest of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waiver claims:</strong> This is the only way to nab a player on a Major League contract until after the end of the World Series. August 31st is still the deadline for postseason eligibility &#8212; that limitation applies also to all classes of players discussed below &#8212; but otherwise teams can claim a contract just like usual. It&#8217;s a simple and direct way to add a player, but entirely uncertain and often undesirable when the deal includes substantial guaranteed money. Note that the priority order is determined by lowest winning percentage on a leaguewide basis. League status (NL/AL) no longer matters, except in the event that two teams placing a claim have the same record.</li>
<li><strong>Signings of outrighted/released players:</strong> Nothing says &#8217;ya can&#8217;t ink a guy who&#8217;s a free agent. That&#8217;s not generally notable, but it could well work in a different manner than it has in years past. It used to be that we&#8217;d talk about revocable trade waivers &#8212; again, <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2018/08/how-august-trades-work-4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">click here</a> if you want to walk down memory lane &#8212; but they&#8217;re now a non-entity. Now, we&#8217;re talking about outright or release waivers. If a team obtains waivers on a well-compensated veteran &#8212; say, <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cabreas01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Asdrubal Cabrera</a></strong>, who was <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/07/rangers-to-designate-asdrubal-cabrera-tim-federowicz.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">designated</a> after failing to draw deadline interest and may well clear &#8212; it&#8217;s quite likely that said player will end up on the open market. Even if they&#8217;re outrighted, players with five or more years of service can elect free agency without sacrificing any guaranteed money. At that point, they&#8217;d be free to sign with any team. Their prior organization would at least stand to recoup a bit of cash for any time said player ends up spending on a MLB roster, earning a pro-rated portion of the league minimum. Point being: there is a way that some high-cost veterans could end up moving to contenders, even if their contracts are too spendy to be claimed.</li>
<li><strong>Dealing for veterans on minor-league deals:</strong> Before you ask, no, this <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> include players whose MLB contracts have already been outrighted. Why do you think <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/straida01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Dan Straily</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/murphjr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">John Ryan Murphy</a></strong> were dealt on deadline day? (Yes, I&#8217;m bragging that <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/07/stashing-depth-at-the-one-true-trade-deadline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">I called it</a>.) But there are plenty of veteran types playing on minors deals who&#8217;d at least represent worthwhile fill-in assets. There are frankly too many to list. You can scroll the Triple-A leaderboards to find some plausible guys who&#8217;ve been performing well this year after settling for minors arrangements. In many cases, such players won&#8217;t come with significant future value for the clubs that control them. Getting a little something in return, and logging some marketplace goodwill by facilitating an opportunity for such a player, might well make a trade worthwhile.</li>
<li><strong>Dealing for prospects: </strong>Who knows? We may even see some higher-end talent moved if a contender gets desperate and sees an opportunity. That used to happen all the time &#8230; albeit generally not with the pre-MLB piece moving to a contender. The reason major August trades were possible in the past was that non-40-man talent could be swapped without having to pass through waivers. Remember when the Astros <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2017/09/astros-to-acquire-justin-verlander.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">sent three quality prospects</a> to the Tigers for <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/verlaju01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Justin Verlander</a></strong> (whose big contract had cleared revocable trade waivers)? That particular deal couldn&#8217;t happen any more, since Verlander couldn&#8217;t be traded, but all such prospects can be dealt as freely as ever. It&#8217;s conceivable we&#8217;ll see prospect-for-prospect arrangements happen this August. It&#8217;s hard to imagine elite players being shipped around, but not impossible. More likely, perhaps, would be a move involving a fast-moving, recently drafted collegiate reliever or lower-ceiling starter who hadn&#8217;t yet been placed on a 40-man roster.</li>
<li><strong>Acquiring players from abroad: </strong>Remember <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2016/07/orioles-sign-logan-ondrusek-to-mlb-deal-designate-chaz-roe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">this move</a>, Orioles fans? That particular mid-season MLB deal for a player that had been playing in Japan didn&#8217;t work out, but it showed a potential (albeit limited) path that could be followed now. Due to roster restrictions, only so many players are suiting up in the Asian professional leagues, so there aren&#8217;t all that many players. And most are not only earning well, but are playing key roles on their teams (with championship schedules that generally align with that of MLB). That might limit the field to players that aren&#8217;t playing all that well or those that can be made available through some inducement to their current team. Still, it&#8217;s definitely a possible avenue for digging up potentially necessary pieces. <a href="https://mykbostats.com/players/foreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">MyKBO</a> provides a helpful table of foreign players in Korea. You can browse the <a href="http://npb.jp/bis/eng/players/active/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">NPB rosters</a> and <a href="http://npb.jp/bis/eng/2019/stats/bat_p.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statistics</a> for possible finds. And there are also quite a few names of note over in Taiwan, as CPBL Stats <a href="http://cpblstats.com/2019-cpbl-foreign-players-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">tracks</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Scouring the independent circuit: </strong>It&#8217;s not the sexiest way to find talent, but cultivating depth is cultivating depth. The Twins already <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/08/mlb-transactions-twins-sign-ramon-flores.html" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">nabbed some outfield depth</a> with such an addition earlier today, and it won&#8217;t be terribly surprising to see the Long Island Ducks, the Sugar Land Skeeters, the St. Paul Saints or the Milwaukee Milkmen (yes, that&#8217;s a franchise) have a few players poached over the course of the month. Those types of signings are often met with an eye roll, but we&#8217;re also nearing the four-year anniversary of <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hillri01.shtml" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Rich Hill</a></strong>&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/08/minor-mlb-transactions-81015.html" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">signing</a> with the Red Sox (out of the Atlantic League).</li>

<p>After posting some solid numbers out of Milwaukee&#8217;s pen in 2017-18, Barnes has struggled this year, resulting in a series of shuttles between Triple-A and the majors.  The 29-year-old has a 6.86 ERA, 10.1 K/9, and 2.00 K/BB rate over 19 2/3 innings for the Brew Crew this season, with increases in his walk and homer rate both influencing that ungainly ERA.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Veteran lefty <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/colliti01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Tim Collins</a></strong> elected free agency rather than accepting an outright assignment from the Cubs, <a href="http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?t=l_trn&amp;lid=112&amp;sid=l112" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League&#8217;s transactions page</a>. Chicago designated Collins, 29, for assignment over the weekend.</p>
<p>Collins appeared in nine games across multiple stints with the Cubs in 2019, allowing a total of three runs on nine hits and three walks with four punchouts. He&#8217;s whiffed 37 hitters in 27 Triple-A innings this season but has also issued 16 walks (three intentional) and surrendered seven home runs there.</p>
<p>Collins was a big piece of the Kansas City bullpen from 2011-14 but missed two full seasons due to multiple Tommy John surgeries. He&#8217;s totaled 31 1/3 big league innings between the Nationals and Cubs since returning from that pair of operations, posting a 25-to-15 K/BB ratio but has yielded a .237/.328/.492 batting line to opposing left-handers.</p>
<p>Still, as an experienced left-hander with a knack for missing bats, Collins should have little difficulty latching on with a different club &#8212; likely a contender. The elimination of August trade waivers will make adding depth via other avenues (e.g. outright waiver claims, free agency) of increased importance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ll track Thursday&#8217;s minor moves from around the league here&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Twins</strong> signed outfielder <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/florera02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Ramon Flores</a></strong> and righty <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=cheshi000jon" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong>Jonathan Cheshire</strong></a> to minor league deals, per an announcement from the Somerset Patriots of the independent Atlantic League. Flores, who was assigned to Triple-A Rochester, has spent parts of three seasons in the big leagues but has played with the Patriots in each of the past two seasons. His 2019 output was particularly impressive, as he batted .311/.395/.467 with nearly as many walks (43) as strikeouts (49). The 27-year-old last appeared in the Majors when he got a brief three-game run with the Angels in 2017, but his most significant stint came with the 2016 Brewers. That season, the Venezuelan-born Flores hit .205/.294/.261 in 289 plate appearances while appearing at all three outfield positions. He&#8217;s yet to find Major League success, but Flores is a career .281/.373/.429 hitter in more than 1400 Triple-A plate appearances. As for Cheshire, he&#8217;s never been in the Majors but notched an impressive 19-to-3 K/BB ratio and a 0.55 ERA in 16 1/3 innings with the Patriots. Cheshire, 24, was cut loose by the Blue Jays earlier this year and has been assigned to Double-A Pensacola with the Twins.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Giants announced that they&#8217;ve designated right-hander <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/winklda01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Dan Winkler</a></strong> for assignment Thursday. His spot on the 40-man roster will go to lefty <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=selman001sam&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Sam Selman</a></strong>, whose contract has been selected from Triple-A Sacramento. The Giants also placed outfielder <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dickeal01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Alex Dickerson</a></strong> on the 10-day injured list due to an oblique strain.</p>
<p>Winkler&#8217;s DFA comes less than 24 hours after the Giants <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/07/braves-to-acquire-mark-melancon.html" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">acquired him</a> in the trade that sent <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/melanma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Mark Melancon</a></strong> to Atlanta. Jettisoning Winkler underscores that the move was largely one about finances for the Giants, who were stunningly able to unload the entirety of Melancon&#8217;s remaining $18.3MM on the Braves.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Winkler has struggled in 2019, pitching to an ugly 4.98 ERA with a 22-to-11 K/BB ratio in 21 2/3 innings of relief this season. He&#8217;s had similar struggles in Triple-A (4.86 ERA, 20-to-18 K/BB in 16 2/3 innings) but is not far removed from a strong 2018 showing. Last season, Winkler pitched to a 3.43 earned run average (and a 2.76 FIP) with 10.3 K/9, 3.0 BB/9, 0.45 HR/9 and a 38.3 percent ground-ball rate. He has minor league options remaining beyond the 2019 season, making it somewhat surprising that the Giants apparently aren&#8217;t planning to take a look at him. Winkler can&#8217;t be traded to another organization under this season&#8217;s new trade structure but can be claimed on outright waivers.</p>
<p>Selman will be making his MLB debut as a 28-year-old rookie after posting some jaw-dropping numbers in the minors. After tossing seven shutout innings in Double-A, he moved up to the hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League and turned in 40 frames of 1.35 ERA ball with 65 strikeouts (14.6 K/9) against 13 walks (2.9 BB/9). He&#8217;s benefited from a minuscule .203 BABIP and an 86 percent strand rate, but Selman&#8217;s ability to miss bats and limit walks is intriguing.</p>
<p>As for Dickerson, he&#8217;s not expected to miss more than 10 days with his current ailment (<a href="https://twitter.com/KO_Crowley/status/1156951716954279937" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Twitter link</a> via Kerry Crowley of the San Jose Mercury News). The 29-year-old has been a godsend for the Giants and helped to fuel San Francisco&#8217;s surge back into the Wild Card picture, hitting .346/.402/.664 with six homers, 10 doubles and three triples in 117 plate appearances.</p>
<p>That level of output isn&#8217;t likely to be maintained, as Dickerson&#8217;s .413 average on balls in play is the fourth-highest of any hitter in baseball (min. 100 PAs). He&#8217;s also battled significant injury issues throughout his career. That said, he does have an outstanding Triple-A track record (.333/.398/.541 in 892 PAs) and enjoyed some big league success with the Padres back in 2016. He&#8217;s controlled three more seasons beyond 2019, making him an intriguing find for the Giants even if (or when) his bat regresses to some extent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Reds announced Thursday that they&#8217;ve selected the contract of outfielder <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/aquinar01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Aristides Aquino</a></strong> from Triple-A Louisville.</p>
<p>Aquino, 25, made his big league debut with the Reds last season but received just one plate appearance in August. He was subsequently non-tendered in the offseason but re-signed with Cincinnati on a new minor league contract just a few days later.</p>
<p>Last season&#8217;s .240/.306/.448 line in Double-A was more impressive than it looks (111 wRC+), considering the pitcher-friendly environment in which he played, but Aquino&#8217;s 2019 season has been far more eye-opening. In 323 trips to the plate, he&#8217;s slashed a robust .299/.356/.636 with 28 home runs, 13 doubles, a triple and five steals. He&#8217;s played exclusively in right field this season and will give Cincinnati a right-handed-hitting replacement option for <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/puigya01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Yasiel Puig</a></strong>, who headed to Cleveland in Tuesday night&#8217;s three-team <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bauertr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Trevor Bauer</a></strong> <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/07/reds-to-acquire-trevor-bauer-in-3-team-deal.html" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">blockbuster</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman defended his organization&#8217;s approach to the trade deadline, as <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2019/07/31/dodgers-acquire-infielder-jedd-gyorko-from-cardinals-at-trade-deadline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">J.P. Hoornstra of the Orange County Register reports</a>. There was some consternation as the team came away with only <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gyorkje01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Jedd Gyorko</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kolarad01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Adam Kolarek</a></strong> yesterday, but Friedman says he&#8217;s satisfied the front office played its hand correctly.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I think our position was to be aggressive,&#8221;</em> said Friedman.<em> </em><em>&#8220;As far as process, conversations and how aggressive we were, we feel really good about what we can control,&#8221;</em> he added.</p>
<p>With a generally exemplary roster, there weren&#8217;t many areas for the Dodgers to upgrade, though the bullpen was certainly one. Perhaps it didn&#8217;t help that many of the top relievers were held by the rival Giants. A late injury to <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gileske01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Ken Giles</a></strong> may have skewed the top of the market.</p>
<p>Most of all, the Dodgers seemed to be focused (quite understandably) on a few top assets &#8212; in particular, so far as was known publicly, ace Pirates closer <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/riverfe01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Felipe Vazquez</a></strong>. Whether they&#8217;d ultimately line up wasn&#8217;t so much a matter of broad market considerations as individual negotiations.</p>
<p>It simply didn&#8217;t happen on Vazquez, with the Bucs reportedly demanding top Dodgers prospect <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=lux---000gav&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Gavin Lux</a></strong>. Pittsburgh GM Neal Huntington says the team was simply &#8220;looking for what we felt was an appropriate return for one of the best relievers in baseball,&#8221; as Rob Biertempfel of The Athletic reports (<a href="https://theathletic.com/1109037/2019/07/31/neal-huntington-still-sees-the-pirates-as-a-future-playoff-team-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">subscription link</a>). That characterization of Vazquez &#8212; an apt one, it&#8217;s worth noting, even before considering his exceptionally valuable contract situation &#8212; offers some insight as to why the deal wasn&#8217;t consummated.</p>
<p>Friedman did not address Vazquez specifically. But he hinted that the club was willing to go beyond its valuations to land such a talent &#8212; just not as far as would&#8217;ve been necessary.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If you expect to win a deal from a value standpoint in July, you&#8217;re not going to make deals,&#8221; </em>he said.<em> &#8220;We made plenty of offers that were definitely underwater from a value standpoint but felt good about making because of the team that we have.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The subtext here is a tough one for some to accept: it was only worth so much future value to improve in the immediate term. Every team has had to reckon with such considerations, even before the analytical explosion. The narrative of the Dodgers as prospect-clutching misers is not really a fair one. This club went big for <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/darviyu01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Yu Darvish</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/machama01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Manny Machado</a></strong> in successive deadlines. There really wasn&#8217;t much need for the team to seek marginal improvements to this particular roster, given the monster lead it has already built in the NL West.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s tough for Dodgers fans not to wish that this team had somehow managed to install a premium new relief arm at the back of the pen. That&#8217;s especially true given how agonizingly close the team has come to a championship in recent campaigns, and how good it is already. The L.A. front office is confident it handled the trade market in a responsible manner, but it&#8217;s also aware that one never knows how the picture will look until the games are played. &#8220;A year or two from now, that could end up being a really good thing,&#8221; Friedman said of the way the deadline played out. &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contrary to expectations, the AL East-leading Yankees held pat on deadline day. GM Brian Cashman says the club &#8220;knocked on all doors&#8221; but ultimately &#8220;didn&#8217;t get close to anything&#8221; when push came to shove, as <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/27298378/cashman-yanks-close-deadline-deals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ESPN.com&#8217;s Cole Harvey</a> was among those to cover.</p>
<p>In the build-up to July 31st, the Bronx Bombers were connected to a laundry list of pitchers, especially of the starting variety. <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rayro02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Robbie Ray</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/minormi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Mike Minor</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bumgama01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Madison Bumgarner</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/syndeno01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Noah Syndergaard</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wheelza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Zack Wheeler</a></strong> &#8230; there were many rumored connections, and likely other possibilities as well. Ultimately, none of those hurlers ended up changing hands, but the Yanks did watch as other orgs snapped up <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greinza01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Zack Greinke</a></strong> (who almost certainly wasn&#8217;t an option in New York), <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/stromma01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Marcus Stroman</a></strong> (who was, but landed across town), and <strong><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bauertr01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Trevor Bauer</a></strong> (perhaps the most obvious match, who somewhat curiously went to the Reds).</p>
<p>What happened? Per Cashman, in some cases the Yankees simply &#8220;didn&#8217;t match up&#8221; with a rival on a given pitcher. In others, players &#8220;weren&#8217;t really available even though they&#8217;re widely talked about in a public setting&#8221; owing to &#8220;contract status issues or medical issues.&#8221; In the end, he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s just a lot of different individual circumstances that basically put us in a position to not be able to complete anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obviously fair to wonder whether the Yankees were too focused on value and not attentive enough to the present. The game&#8217;s preeminent franchise is a decade removed from its last World Series crown and hasn&#8217;t won the division since 2012. While the AL East is all but in hand, there are still scenarios where the Yanks are nipped by the Rays (who added multiple pieces) or Red Sox (who didn&#8217;t). And then there&#8217;s the postseason, an inherent minefield that is sure to include a powerhouse Astros club that just made the single biggest addition of any team in Greinke.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as if Cashman wasn&#8217;t aware of all that.
