<p><strong><em>The Lion King</em></strong> remake has already <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lionkingliveaction.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made over $1 billion worldwide</a>, and it hasn&#8217;t even been in theaters for two weeks. That means Disney will likely be remaking their classic animated movies for years to come, for better or worse. And if you ask the animators behind the original 2D versions of those movies, it&#8217;s undoubtedly worse.</p>
<p>Following the success of <em>The Lion King</em>, several animators who worked on the movie were asked to give their opinion on the remake, which still hasn&#8217;t definitively been classified as live-action or animation. It should come as no surprise that several of these artists are not pleased with the final results of <em>The Lion King</em> remake, not to mention the lack of any recognition for their work, which is especially frustrating considering how many shots are lifted and recreated straight from the original movie.<span id="more-569660"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/original-lion-king-animator-slams-disney-2019-remake-1202162518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieWire</a> reached out to 13 of the animators on <em>The Lion King</em>. Many of them only offered up comments anonymously for fear of stirring up trouble with Disney and jeopardizing their careers. One commented, &#8220;I will only get myself in trouble if I comment on the other version,&#8221; while another said, &#8220;There is a huge resentment against these 3D remakes from the original 2D crews. Maybe if we got any kind of royalties it would be different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Animator <strong>David Stephan</strong> opted to go fully on the record to give not only his statement on the matter, but also summarize the thoughts of many of his colleagues who didn&#8217;t want to publicly speak up. Stephan was responsible for working on the design of the hyenas in the original movie, as well as the memorable &#8220;Circle of Life&#8221; opening sequence that was so meticulously recreated in the new movie. Stephan said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you polled the crew of the original ‘Lion King,’ most of them would say, ‘Why? Did you really have to do that?’ It kind of hurts. It’s sort of sad that the stockholder is now in the room deciding what movies get made. Disney’s now taken the cover off, and it’s now in your face: ‘Yeah, we just want to make money.’ That’s disappointing as an artist, from a studio that was founded on originality and art.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While criticizing Disney for mining their established film library for remake material is totally valid, it&#8217;s a little unfair to the artists who are putting in stellar work within these remakes. While the original storytelling might not be there, it&#8217;s hard to rail against some of the outstanding production design, costume design, and visual effects being brought to life. That doesn&#8217;t mean these movies are as praiseworthy as their animated counterparts, but to discount them so nonchalantly seems a bit mean-spirited.</p>
<p>However, in the case of <em>The Lion King</em>, there&#8217;s much more of an argument to be made when deeming the film unnecessary, especially when it comes to recreating this characters in a way that is photorealistic that it ends up taking away the emotion and expression that came from the original animation. That&#8217;s something Stephan was specifically critical of in his comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It would jar me out of the film, literally. Especially with little Simba walking around. It was too real. And then when he would talk, it reminded me of those old nature films where they would dub the voices over and the lips would move. I thought, ‘Oh, this is really cheap.’ I think it was just too soon for this one.</p>
<p>I just came away going, ‘Wow, that was a great story that I worked on back in ’93.’ How come the apes in ‘Planet of the Apes’ look so much more alive than the animals in ‘Lion King’?” Stephan continued. “This one just said, ‘You know what, let’s cut the expressions out completely. Let’s just keep it real as possible.’ And I think it just diminished the film.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the animals in the movie aren&#8217;t able to emote in the same way, leaving the movie feeling somewhat hollow. The comparison to (presumably) the new<em> Planet of the Apes</em> movies is an interesting one since those were characters created with motion capture performances and visual effects. Could <em>The Lion King</em> remake have benefited from motion capture performances? Or would that have made the animal&#8217;s faces look that much more odd? It&#8217;s easier to accomplish with ape faces being so similar to humans, but when you&#8217;re trying to add human expressions to warthogs, lions, and birds, it&#8217;s not quite so simple.</p>
<p>At the very least, the good news is that there aren&#8217;t many more movies where all the characters are animals (though <em>Oliver &amp; Company</em> and <em>The Aristocats</em> seem like viable contenders), so hopefully this issue of expressionless photorealistic characters won&#8217;t be a problem with many of Disney&#8217;s future projects. However, with the technology that <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/cats-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Cats</em> has put on display</a>, I&#8217;m terrified of a future where Disney&#8217;s <em>Robin Hood</em> gets remade with a human-faced fox.</p>

<p><strong><em>Marvel&#8217;s Runaways</em> </strong>and <strong><em>Marvel&#8217;s Cloak &amp; Dagger</em></strong> have little in common apart from sharing the Marvel banner and teenaged casts. Until now. Marvel&#8217;s two teenage superhero teams will finally be uniting in a <em>Runaways </em>and<em> Cloak and Dagger </em>crossover episode coming to Hulu this December in <em>Runaways</em>&#8216; upcoming third season.</p>
<p><span id="more-569647"></span></p>
<h2>Runaways Cloak and Dagger Crossover Teaser</h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xcv3si66Eds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As <em>Marvel&#8217;s Runaways</em> enters its third season, it&#8217;s going to need a little help from two other superpowered teens. <em>Marvel&#8217;s Runaways</em> season 3 will premiere on December 13 with 10 episodes, one of which will see the Runaways crossing paths with Tyrone Johnson (Cloak) and Tandy Bowen (Dagger) from <em>Marvel&#8217;s Cloak &amp; Dagger</em>. The last time we saw the duo (played by <strong>Aubrey Joseph </strong>and<strong> Olivia Holt</strong>), Cloak and Dagger were on a bus leaving New Orleans in hopes of helping out other parts of the country in the season 2 finale of the Freeform original series. It seems like that road trip will bring them face-to-face with the Runaways: Alex Wilder (<strong>Rhenzy Feliz</strong>), Nico Minoru (<strong>Lyrica Okano</strong>), Karolina Dean (<strong>Virginia Gardner</strong>), Gert Yorkes <strong>(Ariela Barer</strong>)<strong>,</strong> Chase Stein (<strong>Gregg Sulkin</strong>), and Molly Hernandez (<strong>Allegra Acosta</strong>).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s so fun being able to do something that revels in the Mighty Marvel Manner! Having these young heroes crossover allows fans of both shows to see the adventure everyone has been waiting for and we’ve only hinted at,&#8221; said <strong>Jeph Loeb</strong>, Executive Producer and Head of Marvel Television.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Season 3 of <em>Marvel&#8217;s Runaways</em> follows the Runaways as they &#8220;frantically search for their captured friends Chase Stein, Gert Yorkes, and Karolina Dean. The kids go head to head with an unstoppable enemy who has targeted Leslie — or more accurately, the child she’s carrying. Nico Minoru draws them all into a dark realm where its ruler Morgan le Fay, played by Elizabeth Hurley, is much more nefarious than anyone the kids have yet to face.&#8221;</p>
<p>The above teaser of the crossover episode doesn&#8217;t give much of a hint how Cloak and Dagger will cross paths with the Runaways. But we&#8217;ll find out during the Season 3 premiere of Marvel’s Runaways on Hulu on <strong>December 13, 2019.</strong></p>

<p>As a time-traveling alien, the Doctor&#8217;s life is one that&#8217;s always on the move, but at this point the number of streaming services that have housed<strong> <em>Doctor Who</em></strong> is starting to get ridiculous. After &#8220;exclusively&#8221; streaming on Netflix, following by Amazon Prime Video a few years later, <em>Doctor Who</em> is moving to <strong>HBO Max</strong>. The WarnerMedia streaming service has acquired the exclusive <em>Doctor Who</em> streaming rights, along with a slew of other impressive BBC titles including <em>The Office, Top</em> <em>Gear</em>, and <em>Luther.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-569711"></span></p>
<p>HBO Max <a href="https://mailchi.mp/turner/hbo-max-gains-exclusive-streaming-rights-to-the-current-doctor-who-series-in-new-deal-with-bbc-studios-396779?e=82dcf00957" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Thursday that it has acquired the exclusive streaming rights to all 11 seasons of the modern revival of <em>Doctor Who</em> in a new long-term deal with BBC Studios. As part of the deal, HBO Max will also be the exclusive streaming home for future seasons of <em>Doctor Who</em> after they air on BBC America. There&#8217;s no word on whether HBO Max will also bring the &#8220;Classic&#8221; <em>Doctor Who</em> episodes from the original 1960s-1980s run.</p>
<p>“‘Doctor Who’ is one of television’s all-time, most beloved series, on both sides of the pond, and we are happy to be the exclusive streaming stewards for this BBC gem” said Kevin Reilly, Chief Content Officer, HBO Max and president, TNT, TBS, and truTV. “Another series to further define the high-quality content experience consumers can expect from HBO Max.”</p>
<p>As mentioned before, this is just the latest streaming home for <em>Doctor Who</em>, which started to grow a huge Stateside following when it became available on Netflix in the 2010s as part of a multiyear deal that included some &#8220;Classic&#8221; <em>Doctor Who</em> episodes. Amazon quickly swooped in to pick up the streaming rights to <em>Doctor Who</em> beginning in 2016, but it looks like WarnerMedia has begun to pull its weight in the ongoing streaming wars. Its deal with BBC Studios includes not just <em>Doctor Who</em> but 700-plus episodes of other BBC series including <strong><em>The Office, Top</em><em>Gear</em>, <em>Luther, </em></strong>and <strong><em>The Honorable Woman.</em></strong><em> </em>New titles such as <em><strong>Pure</strong><strong>, Trigonometry</strong><strong>, Stath Lets Flats, Home </strong></em>and<em><strong> Ghosts</strong></em><strong> </strong>will also be available upon the launch of WarnerMedia&#8217;s streaming service in spring 2020.</p>
<p>While the &#8220;HBO&#8221; banner communicates one of exclusivity due to the streaming platform&#8217;s frequent pairing with a cable subscription to HBO, HBO Max is an independent service that is WarnerMedia&#8217;s bid to compete with streaming giants Netflix and Hulu. The service will include classic and original titles from Warner Bros., New Line, DC, CNN, TNT, TBS, truTV, The CW, Turner Classic Movies, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Crunchyroll, Rooster Teeth, Hello Sunshine, Looney Tunes and more. And BBC Studios Interim President Nigel Gaines seems confident that HBO Max is where <em>Doctor Who</em> will gain a &#8220;whole new slew of fans coming to the show through this deal with HBO Max,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>So yes U.S. Whovians, it looks like you&#8217;ll have to buy a whole new subscription service to keep up with <em>Doctor Who</em>. It&#8217;s either that, or just play this clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58S7QOAgiZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sad David Tennant</a> over and over in your head.</p>

<p>Hulu&#8217;s harrowing <strong><em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em></strong> features music from composer <strong>Adam Taylor</strong> (<i>August: Osage County, Meadowland</i>), and we&#8217;re debuting an exclusive track from Taylor&#8217;s score. The track is included on the upcoming <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale (Deluxe Edition) </em>soundtrack, due out this month. Hear the exclusive debut from <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em> soundtrack below.</p>
<p><span id="more-569520"></span></p>
<h2><strong>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale Soundtrack </strong></h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sWWjeEMag0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Lakeshore Records will release <b><i>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale (Deluxe Edition) </i></b><b>– Original HULU Series Soundtrack</b> digitally on August 2. The soundtrack features the hit Hulu show&#8217;s original score by composer Adam Taylor, including a bonus track, &#8220;Mom’s Got Work,&#8221; from the opening of the first episode of season 3. That&#8217;s the track we&#8217;re debuting above.</p>
<p>In <em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em>, &#8220;a woman forced into sexual servitude struggles to survive in a terrifying, totalitarian society.&#8221; That woman is June, aka Offred, played by <strong>Elisabeth Moss</strong>. &#8220;Score is so integral to any project,&#8221; said Moss. &#8220;The best composers know how to elevate but not distract, and the best scores match the emotions of the scene. That’s what Adam does. He finds the heart of a scene and illuminates that. The music becomes an extension of the performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This season [season 3], Offred is empowered because she’s pregnant,&#8221; said Taylor. &#8220;We see other characters start to push against the system as well, and as a result, I started to write more for orchestra, more uplifting pieces, more grand sounding. I think of the orchestra as the sound of humanity in the midst of everything. We’re seeing more shades of these characters, outside of the identities that have been forced on them. Last season, they were shrouded in dark tones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Season 3 is &#8220;driven by June&#8217;s resistance to the dystopian regime of Gilead and her struggle to strike back against overwhelming odds. Startling reunions, betrayals, and a journey to the terrifying heart of Gilead force all characters to take a stand, guided by one defiant prayer: &#8216;Blessed be the fight.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The series stars Elisabeth Moss, Joseph Fiennes, Yvonne Strahovski, Samira Wiley, Alexis Bledel, Ann Dowd, Max Minghella, Madeline Brewer, O-T Fagbenle, Amanda Brugel, and Bradley Whitford. The soundtrack tracklist is below.</p>
<p><b><u>Deluxe Edition Track List</u></b></p>

<p><em>(Welcome to <strong>Now Scream This</strong>, a column where horror experts Chris Evangelista and Matt Donato tell you what scary, spooky, and spine-tingling movies are streaming and where you can watch them.)</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Matt: </strong>Looking back, this week’s &#8220;Now Scream This&#8221; theme should have recognized my impending up-and-move from New York City to Los Angeles. Maybe travel horrors? Something about midlife crisis horror? My life is a certifiable *mess* right now, so Chris was gracious enough to waive any thematic parameters beyond, &#8220;Hey, watch these movies!&#8221; All streaming, all accessible, all coming with our seals of approval. I think cross-country relocation grants me a pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Chris:</strong> While we don’t really have a theme this week, I went ahead and added three films with one connection: Rutger Hauer. The actor died recently, and I thought it was important to pay tribute to his weird, impressive career by highlighting three of his very different horror films. Then there are two other movies after that, because I have a quota to fill, folks. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-569609"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jae48OiyIyY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>I Trapped The Devil<br />
<b>Now Streaming on Hulu</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Matt: </strong>Disclaimer: I met </span><b>Josh Lobo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Fantastic Fest a few years back, and we’ve remained friendly since. Back then, we were kids with dreams living their best festival lives while slugging Shiners and devouring wackadoo genre content. When chatting about our aspirations, Lobo confidently claimed, “I’m going to make my own movie.” Four(ish) years later, his feature debut </span><b><i>I Trapped The Devil</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scratches my psychological Christmas horror itch in line with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Twilight Zone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vibes. Is there anything cooler than watching a friend achieve all their goals in a way you can also share and promote? Sure as hell helps that I dig </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Trapped The Devil</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a cinematic entity, chumminess be damned. Horror bros can get sappy too, ya know!</span></p>
<p><b>Chris: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Trapped The Devil</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a neat little slow-burn chiller that makes great use of Christmas lights, and owes more than a few debts to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Twilight Zone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and John Carpenter. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcK6G3UnPrE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Girls With Balls<br />
Now Streaming on Netflix</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Matt: </strong>Do I love Netflix because it grants smaller indie horror flicks access to subscriber viewership numbers regular VOD can’t solely attain? Yes. Do I wish Netflix would give any promotion or warning before movies randomly appear as streamable? You betcha. </span><b>Olivier Afonso</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><b><i>Girls With Balls</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the latest festival acquisition to land on Netflix without prompt, buried under an avalanche of &#8220;Original&#8221; content. I’ve got a </span><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/girls-with-balls-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full review out of last year’s Fantastic Fest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this &#8220;volleyball vixens vs. killer rednecks&#8221; flick if you’d like more established critical analysis, but for the purpose of this column, know Afonso’s flick is a slasher with teen spirit, a midnighter with malice, and the gory corpse counter that’s suggested. Kudos for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead &amp; Breakfast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> singing narrator nod, intentional or by chance.</span></p>
<p><b>Chris: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There Matt goes, making up movies again. Nice try. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tM2E3LUYPig?start=4&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Into The Dark: Culture Shock<br />
Now Streaming on Hulu</h2>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Matt: </strong></span>Gigi Saul Guerrero</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><b><i>Culture Shock</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the first </span><b><i>Into The Dark</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommendation around these parts because, frankly, it’s the first one that demands to be seen. My love for March’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treehouse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is nary replicated, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culture Shock</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has unanimously become </span><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/culture-shock-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a favorite amongst series critics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a July 4th tale of xenophobia, blind consumption of an “American Dream,” and heritage erased for the price of freedom. Guerrero works with agency and unrest, crafting a Mexican horror story quite personal given her ethnicity. It’s about time the Blumhouse and Hulu series used its holiday horror platform to speak outwardly about modern terrorization. Let’s hope this trend continues.</span></p>
<p><b>Chris: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve pulled the plug on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Into the Dark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – I’ve been disappointed by every segment. But this one features the always-welcomed Barbara Crampton, so maybe I’ll check it out. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-ZWtZloXB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Party Hard, Die Young<br />
Now Streaming on Shudder</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Matt: </strong>From </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attack Of The Lederhosen Zombies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> director </span><b>Dominik Hartl</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes </span><b><i>Party Hard, Die Young</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sunburnt slasher throwback to &#8217;80s carefree structures. &#8220;X-Jam&#8221; plays location for a masked killer’s rampage, where European students are permitted a week of regulated partying before running off to their next level of schooling (jealous). From here it’s about sins of our past, consequences experienced, and bloody deaths as the film’s killer picks off targets one by one. There’s a lot of fun gore here, plus a &#8220;Whodunnit&#8221; mystery that keeps viewers guessing as clues wash ashore. For those who’re waiting for a genre-spread slasher renaissance, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Party Hard, Die Young</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will tide you over.</span></p>
<p><b>Chris:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is this about Andrew W.K.? (But seriously folks: the minute I saw this on Shudder, I thought: &#8220;Well, that’s a Donato movie.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v4nlXmRVKMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Stake Land<br />
Now Streaming on Shudder</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Matt: </strong>Vampire cinema became a disco-reflective punchline during the late 2000s and early 2010s thanks to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twilight</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but </span><b>Jim Mickle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><b><i>Stake Land</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reminds you how horrifying vamps can be. In a dystopian world where bloodsuckers roam free, Martin (</span><b>Connor Paolo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and his mentor &#8220;Mister&#8221; (</span><b>Nick Damici</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) are trying to survive. Damici co-writes a screenplay alongside Mickle entrenched in a rural America now reduced to safehouse communes where citizens fear nightfall. It’s the gritty, snarly, tear-out-your-esophagus brand of vampire story that 2010 needed — and still stands the test of time almost a decade later.</span></p>
<p><b>Chris: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stake Land</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a cool vampire indie that has atmosphere to burn. The sequel ain’t half-bad either. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS has had no shortage of sexual assault and harassment scandals. At the top of their network, CBS fired Les Moonves after a series of sexual misconduct and assault allegations last year. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NCIS: New Orleans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> producer Brad Kern was investigated twice. Last year, Eliza Dushku was dismissed from </span><strong><i>Bull </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a $9.5 million settlement when she brought sexual harassment allegations against star <strong>Michael Weatherly</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS executives <strong>Kelly Kahl</strong> and <strong>Thom Sherman</strong> spoke with the Television Critics Association today. Find out how they responded to questions about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bull</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bull</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> returns for a fourth season September 23.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-569681"></span></p>
<h2><b>Weatherly and Showrunner Glenn Gordon Caron Are Going Through Training</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dushku <a href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/eliza-dushku-bull-sexual-harassment-settlement-cbs-1203093433/">alleged</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Weatherly made jokes about wanting to have a threesome with her and other costars, along with other sexual remarks. As part of her settlement, she also signed an NDA. Kahl said that Weatherly and others are going through training subsequent to the incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Weatherly] is undergoing leadership coaching,” Kahl said. “He is taking his responsibility as the head of the show to make the set a positive way to work. He was there last week and the entire cast and crew had just undergone some training at the start. Glenn is also undergoing leadership training. It has started and will continue. I don’t know if it was mandated. We all agreed to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leadership training, but not sexual harassment training specifically?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s kind of implied in the name,” Kahl said. “It’s how to be a leader on the set. It’s how to set a positive example for everybody. Michael takes that very seriously. I think Glenn does as well. These are the two people front and center on the show. They want to be as strong and as good and as fair leaders as they can be. This training helps them do that. We’ve had some courses at CBS recently that have helped us learn about cross generational leadership. we’ve done unconscious bias training. None of us are too old or too smart to learn how to do things better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that we expected anything more, but CBS must know this looks like a slap on the wrist. They won’t even use the phrase “sexual harassment” in addressing it. /Film asked if sexual harassment was a component of leadership training and Kahl referred to it as “anti-harassment” training.</span></p>
<h2><b>Like It or Not, America Still Loves Bull</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS may be willing to cut their losses and move on with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bull</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but production company Amblin Entertainment was not. They pulled out of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bull</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May. Not everybody felt as strongly as Amblin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t speak for Amblin but to us, it’s a show that does very well,” Kahl said. “It’s a very popular show. More than 10 million people watch every week. Michael is loved by our audience. Even after these allegations came out, people continued to watch so it’s a popular show that we want to keep on our air. And it’s a very good show as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therein lies much of the problem. Many of the men accused of harassment or worse have been beloved by a segment of the audience. Protecting them sends a message that if you’re popular enough, or really if you make the network enough money, they can throw cash at your problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We talked a lot about this in May, discussed it with the press,” Kahl said. “We found out about the settlement the same time you did. We took a 360 view of the entire situation when we found out about that. We wanted to look at it with fresh eyes. What we found was in Michael’s case, no incidents, no complaints in his time at <em>Bull</em>, none on either side of the isolated incident on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bull</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He was at the time remorseful and apologetic when the settlement came out and was made public, he was remorseful again and apologized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that they are moving forward with a fourth season, I expect CBS to stand by its stars and creators. They were still evasive as more and more Moonves allegations emerged. The message they are sending is that they’re not really going to talk about this in a meaningful way, even if a reporter specifically asks them about Dushku’s claim that she was fired within 48 hours of reporting the incident <a href="https://time.com/5548474/eliza-dushku-metoo-mapplethorpe/">and that Caron said, “What does she expect? She was in Maxim.”</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think all of our shows, everybody top to bottom is receiving training now,” Kahl responded. “I think we’ve had some other situations with bad behavior from showrunners. In any situation where we receive information or hear something is askew on a show, we investigate immediately. That’s what happened on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bull</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There was a settlement that was reached. I can’t add a lot more to it other than the expectation of our showrunners is very clear. They will run a welcoming set for everyone on it from top to bottom.” </span></p>
<h2><b>Diversity is Also Important to CBS</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS has faced many TCA sessions where it’s been pointed out how white their shows are. Last year, shows like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Neighborhood </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">God Friended Me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> featured more African-American cast members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year our new slate of show was a good first step and I think with our slate this year we’ve taken a couple more steps forward,” Kahl said. “We still have a lot of work to do but we’re confident we’re on the right path. Our commitment continues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall they have new series starring Mike Colter, Aasif Mandvi, Lucy Liu,  Simone Missick, Folake Olowofoyeku and more diverse creators too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are clearly looking different on air,” Sherman added. “Our commitment to inclusion and diversity behind the scenes is important. This season 53% of our writers are women or People of Color. 50% of our directors will be women or people of color. We know that work must continue and it will continue as we look to evolve culturally, creatively and commercially. As we move forward, we’re going to continue to widen the lens of the shows we do at CBS.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are good numbers. Let’s hope the shows are good too. </span></p>

<p>A fantastic new <strong><em>It Chapter Two</em></strong> featurette delves into the highly-anticipated horror sequel, promising to both crank-up the horror <em>and</em> to tell a story that gives you all the feels, as the kids say. Plus: director <strong>Andy Muschietti</strong> reveals that<strong> Stephen King</strong> requested the creation of an entirely new scene – one not in the source material – for the film.</p>

<h2><strong>It Chapter Two Featurette</strong></h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8vQ8FHD8wM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>My excitement for <em>It Chapter Two</em> was already through the roof, but this new behind-the-scenes featurette might have just put it over the moon. This is the type of epic, exciting featurette they usually create for the new <em>Star Wars</em> sequels, and to see the same level of attention be bestowed on a Stephen King adaptation warms my heart. When I was a lonely kid growing up obsessed with King&#8217;s novels, I never thought I&#8217;d live to see a time when new adaptations of his books were considered to be major events. But here we are, and I&#8217;m not complaining.</p>
<p>King pops-up in this featurette to sing the praises of the upcoming sequel. He also highlights what made the 2017 <em>It</em> so special: director Andy Muschietti understood that the key to bringing a King novel to life isn&#8217;t just about getting the scares right – you have to get the characters right, too. King has a real gift for creating believable, empathetic characters, and the first <em>It</em> movie did a great job conveying that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in this featurette, the cast of the flick – including<strong> Jessica Chastain</strong>, <strong>James McAvoy</strong>, <strong>Bill Skarsgard</strong>, <strong>Bill Hader</strong> and more – talk about how the sequel is going to take audiences on an emotional journey. &#8220;This movie shows [that] when you get together with your friends, there&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t accomplish,&#8221; says <strong>Isaiah Mustafa</strong>, who plays the adult Mike. Also: take a look at the adult Losers&#8217; Club having fun between takes. I&#8217;m so proud of my kids.</p>

<p>As if all this weren&#8217;t enough, Total Film (via <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/stephen-king-requested-completely-new-scene-it-chapter-2">Syfy</a>) has an interview with Muschietti in which the filmmaker reveals that Stephen King suggested a brand new scene for the sequel. Muschietti doesn&#8217;t say what the scene is, but he confirms that he sent the script for <em>It Chapter Two</em> to King and that King made notes and requested &#8220;one all-new scene.&#8221; King had next to no involvement with the 2017 <em>It</em> adaptation, so knowing he had more of a direct hand in this sequel is exciting.</p>
<p><em>It Chapter Two</em> opens <strong>September 6, 2019</strong>.</p>

<p>When <strong>Star Wars Galaxy&#8217;s Edge</strong> opened in Disneyland this summer, it was groundbreaking for a few reasons. Not only was it the first theme park expansion dedicated entirely to <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong>, but Oga&#8217;s Cantina marked the first time that alcohol would be available in the park outside of the the exclusive Club 33 and other private events on park grounds. Now, Walt Disney World in Florida will offer another first in Galaxy&#8217;s Edge when it opens in August: alcoholic beverages will be available in the land there outside of Oga&#8217;s Cantina.<span id="more-569571"></span></p>

<p>Not even Oga&#8217;s Cantina in Disneyland has alcoholic versions of these colorful milks, so it sounds like Disney World may end up having the superior Galaxy&#8217;s Edge experience when all is said and done. Then again, since the humidity down in Florida makes it feel like you&#8217;re on the surface of a sun that&#8217;s been dunked in a swamp, they probably need alcohol much more often there.</p>

<p>Disney World has been more relaxed about the availability of alcohol than Disneyland for awhile. The theme park introduced the &#8220;Be Our Guest&#8221; restaurant, inspired by Beauty and the Beast, which made beer and wine available in the Magic Kingdom. Is there any chance that Disneyland could follow suit in the future? Maybe that&#8217;ll be a surprise for when the <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/rise-of-the-resistance-opening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second attraction opens</a> at Galaxy&#8217;s Edge there later this year.</p>

<p>Animation is a medium, not a genre. But because most animated projects are geared towards kids and their parents, it can be hard for everyday people to make a proper distinction. But when it comes to Amazon&#8217;s new trippy drama <strong><em>Undone</em></strong>, it&#8217;s clear that animation isn&#8217;t just for kids.</p>
<p><em>Undone</em> follows a young, depressed woman (<strong>Rosa Salazar </strong>of <em>Alita: Battle Angel</em>) whose life is irreversibly and wildly changed after a car accident gives her a newfound ability to shift through time. But since this is a scary prospect and she&#8217;s not really sure what&#8217;s going on, the ghost of her dead father (<strong>Bob Odenirk</strong>) is here to help her, and that includes showing her how he actually died. If that sounds weird to you, just wait until you see the <em>Undone</em> trailer.<span id="more-569644"></span></p>
<h2>Undone Trailer</h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uWCNHQgfnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Featuring rotoscoped animation along the lines of something like Richard Linklater&#8217;s film <em>A Scanner Darkly</em>, Amazon&#8217;s new series seamlessly blends the questionably real and surreal, creating a storytelling style that is as gorgeous as it is disorienting. Our own Jacob Hall <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/stumptown-emergence-undone-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught two episodes</a> of the series at Comic-Con last month and noted, &#8220;Your mind often reads scenes as three-dimensional and two-dimensional at the same time, perfect for a series that manipulates reality at its whims and allows the absurd, the surreal, the beautiful, and the frightening to invade a scene as the story dictates.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what about the story? It sounds like that&#8217;s just as engaging too. Our reaction from the screening at Comic-Con says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the course of its first two episodes, <em>Undone</em> asks the viewer to buy into two seemingly different shows. The first episode is a blend of domestic drama and wry comedy about an aimless young woman, her happier sister, her smothering mother, and the figment of a dead father who continues to figuratively haunt the family. It’s a tough, honest show, one unafraid to cast its characters in an ugly light and wallow in their poor choices, practically daring you like them…and you do, because their baggage is so specific that it can’t help but feel universal. The second episode is where the larger plot really kicks in, where that dead father haunting becomes literal, where the stripped-down presentation goes into hyperactive stylization, and where the melancholies and emotional burdens become literal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The series certainly doesn&#8217;t feel like something the producers of <em>Bojack Horseman</em> would create. Though the animated comedy series does tackle depression in a poignant and comedic way, <em>Undone</em> looks like something completely different. I think it&#8217;s safe to say that we haven&#8217;t seen a series like this in the streaming world at all, and it will be interesting to see if audiences pick up what it&#8217;s putting down when the series hits Amazon on <strong>September 13, 2019</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Undone is a half-hour, genre-bending, animated series that explores the elastic nature of reality through its central character Alma, a twenty-eight-year-old living in San Antonio, Texas. After getting into a car accident and nearly dying, Alma finds she has a new relationship to time. She develops this new ability in order to find out the truth about her father’s death.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS executive Tom Sherman announced development on a TV series based on <strong><em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em></strong> during his Television Critics Association executive session today, with television veteran <strong>David E. Kelly</strong> writing the pilot. Michael Connelly’s book was previously adapted as a movie starring Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller, a lawyer who practices out of his Ford Lincoln Town Car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news is fresh so details are scant, but here are a few things we know about the CBS version of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lincoln Lawyer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a few things we can extrapolate based on our knowledge of the previous movie and book series.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-569677"></span></p>
<h2><b>David E. Kelley Does Good Law Shows</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley created </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ally McBeal, The Practice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Legal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Lincoln Lawyer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is in his wheelhouse, that’s for sure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve made a series commitment with David for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lincoln Lawyer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Sherman said. “His take on Mickey Haller is brilliant. He’s off writing right now. We’re salivating to get his first script.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley has adapted books before too, most recently </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Little Lies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Mercedes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Combining his skills for adaptation with his skills for making legal briefs and closing arguments entertaining should be a winning combination. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Lincoln Lawyer is a Franchise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movie was expected to be a new franchise for McConaughey. Since that didn’t happen, turning the remaining stories into a series makes sense. Haller could conceivably try a different case from his car every week. But will Kelley take that kind of episodic approach, or will he serialize the story of the book over one or more seasons?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are six Mickey Haller books in Connelly’s series. That’s at least six episodes right there. Kelley likes to do more topical cases though. While he may draw some inspiration from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brass Verdict</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fifth Witness</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he’ll probably see current issues through the eyes of Mickey Haller. </span></p>
<h2><b>A Lincoln Lawyer Shared Universe?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Connelly’s books, Mickey Haller is the younger brother of Harry Bosch. Bosch has his own series on Amazon Prime, so it’s unlikely they’ll cross over on CBS. However, Kelley does have an Amazon show, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goliath</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so he has an in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, Kelley likes a shared universe.<em> The Practice</em>, <em>Boston Legal</em>, and <em>Ally McBeal</em> all took place in the same world and often crossed over.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Lincoln Lawyer is a Year Away</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since today was just the announcement, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lincoln Lawyer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is still far from hitting the screen. Kelley is also a writer who likes to write every script himself. He’s got to do the pilot first, but then he’ll probably be doing all or most of the 22 in a season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No casting yet,” Sherman said. “We don’t have a script yet, can’t wait to get that. It is targeted for 2020-2021, not for this season.”</span></p>

<p><em>(Welcome to <strong><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-soapbox/">The Soapbox</a></strong>, the space where we get loud, feisty, political, and opinionated about anything and everything. In this edition: is it still surprising when <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> decides to rewrite history?)</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting in the theater, waiting for the lights to dim, I couldn’t help but wonder how Quentin Tarantino would surprise me with his latest film, </span><strong><i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Tarantino, and the marketing campaign, would argue this is his ninth feature film, but I am firmly in the “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kill Bill</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is two movies” camp, so I’m calling it his tenth.) I’d heard the mostly positive reactions out of the film’s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, and was generally intrigued not only by the cast, but the 1960s setting. I was a bit cautious, though, because I kept wondering if the movie would end with a mirror of the history it captures, or by revising it. In the end (and this is where I warn you about <strong>major spoilers</strong>), the movie revises history in ways that are unfortunately more predictable than I’d hoped.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-569595"></span></p>
<h2><b>A Revisionist History</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes place in the Dream Factory circa 1969, fairy-tale title and all. The two lead characters – has-been actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stuntman/best friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) – are fictional, but they butt up against history. Rick’s swanky Hollywood Hills house is right next door to the abode of director Roman Polanski and his wife and actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Tate, tragically, was brutally murdered in one of the Manson Family killings on August 9, 1969. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketing for the film has, if not directly leaned into this knowledge, hinted at something ominous afoot including a brief image of cult leader Charles Manson (played by Damon Herriman). So as I waited for the film to start, I wondered more directly: would this movie lean into revisionist history the same way that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inglourious Basterds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Django Unchained</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did, gleefully ignoring the horrors of real-world history in favor of a more cathartic revenge fantasy? Or would this film represent those horrors, thus becoming even more grisly than the fantasy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those other movies are enough of a hint to what happens here: revisionist history all over again. Yes, Manson and his many followers are part of the movie, and some of them even have a good deal of screen time. (Manson, notably, does not: he’s in just one scene and has maybe three lines of dialogue.) And yes, we follow a few of them as they intend to break into Sharon Tate’s house, where she (and her unborn baby) were, along with a few friends, gruesomely murdered in real life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tarantino’s version doesn’t even let those killer hippies get to Tate’s house. They’re distracted by a grouchy, anti-hippie-ranting Dalton, a high-on-acid Booth, and then are killed by Dalton and Booth in variously florid and bloody ways. In the end, the film is slightly worse off by wedging its characters into real history. It took three times, but it’s finally become an unsurprising distraction for Quentin Tarantino to turn history into a playbook of fantasy.</span></p>
<h2><b>A Solid Start</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need to emphasize here (because I’m sure I’m losing a lot of you by this point): I really enjoyed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">…for about 120 of its 161-minute runtime. If this movie had entirely focused on Cliff Booth lazily driving around Los Angeles, and Rick Dalton trying his damnedest to survive by doing guest spots on various TV shows in the late 1960s, I might have placed this very close to the top of my list of the best Tarantino films. This film is at its strongest when its characters are inserted into the real world without directly affecting too much of history’s arc. DiCaprio is unsurprisingly excellent, playing an intensely insecure and vulnerable character who’s desperate to stop the downward arc of his career. And Pitt, at his most laconic, is a lot of fun as a deadpan, gone-to-seed type who knows and accepts his place in the world, thus enjoying himself more than the rest of us struggling to get by. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margot Robbie, too, is quite good in her limited time on screen as Sharon Tate. (I realize that there was a kerfuffle at Cannes when Tarantino “rejected the hypothesis” of a reporter who asked why Tate, as a character, isn’t in much of the movie, but&#8230;uh&#8230;she’s not in a lot of the movie. Not so much a critical hypothesis as a statement of fact.) Robbie’s best scene, like many of the scenes she has in the film, doesn’t require her to talk too much, reacting instead to how everyone else reacts to her either in person or on screen. Tate, on a whim, goes into an LA theater showing the movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wrecking Crew</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a caper in which the actress co-starred with Dean Martin. Robbie-as-Tate, watching the real Tate on the big screen, enjoys the experience so much because she thrives in the audience laughing in tune with her character’s klutziness. It’s a sweet moment, but just one of few she has in the film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the first two hours or so, which all takes place on one February weekend in 1969, Tate is almost a ghost hovering over the film. Tarantino cuts to her and her Hollywood hangouts every so often, but the meandering story is much more focused on Dalton (struggling to accept that his future may include making Spaghetti Westerns in Italy) and Booth. The Manson Family specter exists in this section, but somewhat on the periphery: while Booth is at Dalton’s house, fixing a cable antenna, he sees a stringy-haired guy go to Tate’s house next door, not realizing she and husband Roman Polanski are the new owners. That guy is, of course, Charles Manson, whose reputation already seems to precede him. </span></p>
<h2><b>A Run-In With Ominous Destiny</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film’s best scene is its most suspenseful, when Booth comes into the most direct contact with real-life history. Throughout that February weekend, he keeps driving by a pretty young hippie (Margaret Qualley) named Pussycat who’s hitchhiking through the metropolis. Eventually, their paths line up and he offers to drive her to her home, which happens to be one of his old stomping grounds, Spahn’s Movie Ranch. For Booth, it’s a place where he and Dalton used to shoot Westerns; for Pussycat, it’s where the Manson Family holed up in advance of their summer-1969 murders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Booth arrives at the deserted ranch, with boarded-up sets and a tiny house that looks as imposing as the Bates Motel, it’s clear to him (as well as to the audience) that something is very wrong. But the stuntman wants to see the elderly owner of the ranch, George Spahn (Bruce Dern), precisely because he finds it so hard to believe that the old man would let hippies run rampant there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ensuing setpiece doesn’t have too much in the way of action, but a great deal of tension suffusing the atmosphere. After getting stonewalled by Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning), Booth goes into the house at the end of the ranch, sees that Spahn is alive and grumpy as ever, and apparently let the hippies there of his own volition. Booth exits, only to find that the hippies slashed the tires on Dalton’s car, which he’d been driving. Instead of becoming an early corpse, though, Booth makes one of the only male hippies fix the tire, after beating him nearly unconscious. All told, it’s a tense scene precisely because Tarantino sets things up so you have no idea how the scene could end. By now, we’ve already seen Booth in a fight (real or imagined, we’ll never know) with Bruce Lee where he more than held his own. But these hippies could easily off Booth. When he escapes, it feels like he’s escaped fate one more time.</span></p>
<h2><b>Living Happily Ever After</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, unfortunately, isn’t a feeling replicated by the final 40 minutes, set on the night leading up to the fateful murder of Sharon Tate. After the hippies recognize Dalton as the star of an old TV Western, they change up their plan: they’ll kill him as a representation of how Hollywood teaches young people to murder. But Booth, even after smoking an acid-tipped cigarette, is able to viciously murder two of the Manson Family members (with the help of his well-trained pit bull). Dalton, who’s otherwise completely unaware of the intruders, takes the third hippie out with a working flamethrower that had been a prop in an old film of his. It’s not just that Dalton and Booth stop the Manson Murders from happening (or, at least, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">those</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specific murders, since the Manson Family did kill again after August 9). It’s that they don’t even realize the historical weight of what they’ve done. They just took out a few house invaders on one weird night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stopping the murder of Sharon Tate feels, on the surface, like a sweet way to pay homage to an actress whose legacy has cruelly turned into her presence as a dead body. But there’s never a moment in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when Rick and Cliff (the ostensible leads of the film, though they’re often doing their own thing, as opposed to hanging out with each other) directly interact with Tate, Polanski, or Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch), at least until the very last scene when Sebring invites Dalton into Tate’s abode to talk about the bloody climax. It’s not that this film shouldn’t take place in 1969 — its setting is key to what makes the film so charming for so long. It’s that the direct convergence of history doesn’t quite resonate the way it’s done before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s largely because it’s no longer a surprising twist, but just another familiar trick for Tarantino to pull. When </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inglourious Basterds </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ended with the eponymous group, along with the fierce young Jewish woman Shoshana, literally killing Adolf Hitler and other key Nazis, well before they were actually taken down, it wasn’t just viscerally cathartic. It was shocking without feeling too prurient or puerile. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Django Unchained</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t quite the same as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basterds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in that it takes place during a violent period of American history while not culminating in the hero ending the Civil War all on his own. But the successful rebellion from Django feels like a deliberate rewriting of history to allow black men agency they were robbed of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I sat down to watch </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I mused that there were really only two ways the film could end: either Sharon Tate would be murdered, or she (or someone else) would stop the murders from happening. Despite a recent Wikipedia page update that implied the film ended with her, Dalton, Booth, and Bruce Lee (who shows up here briefly, played by Mike Moh) taking down Charles Manson and his followers, the ending is both not nearly so wild and also exactly in line with that way of thinking. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is mostly action-free, which adds to its charm. When blood is spilled in the final stretch, it feels almost perfunctory, a sense that is anathema to Tarantino’s best films.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had ended with Rick Dalton flying off to Italy for six months to make a series of Spaghetti Westerns, with the rise of the Manson Family coming soon, it might have had a more bittersweet taste, but it would have felt more satisfying. All told, this is still a thrilling and often suspenseful step back into the past (or at least a step back into an idealized version of the past) that allows two of the industry’s biggest modern stars the ability to show off how talented they still are. But the end of this movie, in which fantasy and history collide, isn’t as fresh as the way they’ve collided in other Tarantino films. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, as the director has said, he’s only going to make one more movie, and it’ll be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adaptation, I can’t wait. Not just because it’s a Tarantino film, and not just because I like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movies. It’s because Quentin Tarantino is at his best when he’s surprising audiences. The first two hours of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a pleasant surprise; the last 40 minutes don’t quite get there because they play familiar notes.</span></p>

<p>There have been rumors swirling that <strong>Andy Serkis</strong> was on the verge of landing the <strong><em>Venom 2 </em></strong>director gig, and we might have just gotten confirmation. Quickly deleted confirmation, that is. Venom himself, <strong>Tom Hardy</strong>, posted a pic of Serkis on his Instagram last night – and then immediately took it down. Was this Hardy accidentally letting the symbiote out of the bag too soon? Or is he just a really big fan of Andy Serkis pictures?</p>
<p><span id="more-569649"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Tom-Hardy-Andy-Serkis-Venom-2-Instagram.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-569661" src="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Tom-Hardy-Andy-Serkis-Venom-2-Instagram-700x338.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="338" srcset="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Tom-Hardy-Andy-Serkis-Venom-2-Instagram-700x338.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Tom-Hardy-Andy-Serkis-Venom-2-Instagram-360x174.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Tom-Hardy-Andy-Serkis-Venom-2-Instagram-768x370.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Tom-Hardy-Andy-Serkis-Venom-2-Instagram.jpg 1107w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>Above you can see a screenshot of Tom Hardy&#8217;s Instagram account, featuring a not-so-cryptic pic of Andy Serkis. While Hardy didn&#8217;t include any text – just the fire emoji – the implication is clear: Serkis is directing <em>Venom 2</em>. Of course, until this is officially announced, this is all just speculation. But last week it was <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/venom-2-director/">revealed</a> that Rupert Wyatt, Travis Knight, and Serkis were all being considered to helm <em>Venom 2</em>. Based on the quickly-deleted Instagram post above, Serkis landed the job.</p>
<p>Unless he didn&#8217;t. Perhaps Hardy was just signaling the filmmaker he&#8217;d most like to work with. Perhaps he really enjoys this particular photo of Andy Serkis. I&#8217;m sure there are other possible scenarios you can think up here, but Occam&#8217;s razor dictates that Hardy was <em>probably</em> signaling Serkis was going to take on directorial duties. Hardy likely deleted the post because he didn&#8217;t realize he didn&#8217;t have the studio approval to reveal the news just yet.</p>
<p>The first <em>Venom</em> was an absolute mess, with a monumentally dumb screenplay. And yet&#8230;I can&#8217;t deny I <em>sort of</em> enjoyed the film. The main source of enjoyment was from Hardy&#8217;s performance, which was full-on bonkers. Hardy didn&#8217;t hold anything back, going above and beyond – and into a lobster tank – to bring his own interpretation of Eddie Brock to life.</p>
<p>Bringing a new director in for <em>Venom 2</em> is a smart move. I haven&#8217;t seen Serkis&#8217;s <em>Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle</em> (or his drama <em>Breathe</em>), but the actor and filmmaker has a unique perspective on working with digital effects, and motion capture work. Letting Serkis bring his knowledge of this process to <em>Venom 2</em> might elevate the material considerably, and result in a better movie.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Television Critics Association visited the set of <strong><em>I</em></strong></span><strong><em>t’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the show is filming its landmark 14th season. That’s 14 years of the gang getting in trouble. They haven’t run out of schemes, and they certainly haven’t learned their lesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cast and creators of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spoke to reporters after the tour of Paddy’s Pub, Frank and Charlie’s apartment, and Dee’s apartment. Charlie Day, Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, Kaitlin Olson and Danny Devito previewed the upcoming 14th season, which premieres Wednesday, September 25 at 10PM on FXX.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-569567"></span></p>
<h2><b>All Waiting for Godot Needed Was More Laser Tag</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may do raunchy jokes, but you can’t say they aren’t educated. Day cited the Samuel Beckett play <em>Waiting for Godot</em> as an inspiration for a season 14 episode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doing a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting for Godot </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">themed laser tag episode that America has always wanted,” Day said.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting for Godot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is famously a play where nothing happens. They just wait and, spoiler alert, Godot never shows up. Day explained how it applies to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunny</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went through a lot of versions of the draft and some of them were a lot more existential where nothing was happening and we realized this isn’t going to work,” Day said. “We’ve got to get a few jokes in there. It’s a fun way for the characters to contemplate themselves, who they are as people and for us as a show to contemplate the show and its success or lack of and how long we’ve been on. We use those metaphors but we also make sure there’s plenty of laser tag themed moments to keep the pacing going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunny’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s best episodes are its most outrageous, like the musical episode where they sing “What are the rules,” the other musical episode where Charlie mounts a stage production of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nightman Cometh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the ones where Mac and Dennis make sequels to <em>Lethal Weapon</em>. Laser Tag </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting for Godot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn’t sound as outrageous in context.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Gang Still Tackles Current Events</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hasn’t shied away from topical commentary, like last season’s “Times Up For The Gang.” Some events have remained relevant since season one, when the gang went to an abortion rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dee comes in saying that she wants to get a haircut,” McElhenney said. “The four of us decide that she should not be getting that haircut because yes, it is her body, but we have to live with the choices that she makes about her body. Ultimately, we all have to live together. We have to look at the hair so we should get a say in what you do with your body. When that was pitched, we’re like well, that’s a great new way of looking at an issue that we’ve already dealt with this season.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With restrictive abortion laws in states like Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and more, we need the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunny</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gang to weigh in more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s just a little bit more fun to not tackle abortion directly but make it about something else where it’s clearly about that,” Howerton said. &#8220;It’s about having a very strong opinion about her not having a short haircut.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another episode tackles global warming, which DeVito laments will always be relevant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can always do a global warming episode,” DeVito said. “We can do one every year. It gets worse and worse.”</span></p>
<h2><b>The Gang Gets in on Airbnb</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb has made travel much more affordable and comfortable, and helped homeowners make some extra money. Leave it to the gang to ruin it for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve also got an episode that really kicks off because we’re all Airbnbing our apartments,” Howerton said. “We’re all using it as a way to find romance. So it’s a bit of like Airbnb/romantic comedy episode.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve watched the show, would you Airbnb in Charlie and Frank’s place?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s where the comedy kicks in,” Day said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McElhenney added, “It’s all about managing expectations.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Mac Hasn’t Changed</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Season 13 had a landmark episode where Mac came out. Now that he’s living openly, McElhenney says he hasn’t changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pretty much exactly the same,” McElhenney said. “We wanted to make sure that even though the characters might change, that they don’t evolve. We want to make sure that he doesn’t become a better person or a sweeter person or a more endearing person or a nicer person. We felt like we still wanted to keep the tone, so I would say in all the right ways, he’s remained exactly the same.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s classic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunny</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for you. Even after profound life moments, they’re still the same old A-holes.</span></p>
<h2><b>Guest Stars and Genres</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolph Lundgren will be playing action hero John Thundergun in an episode. Hopefully, he can live up to the legacy of the late Roddy Piper’s</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sunny </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cameo. Another episode also delves into a classic film genre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a film noir episode,” Day said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s hope it involves Charlie in a trenchcoat taking a case from The Waitress who betrays him in a shocking twist. </span></p>

<p>Whether it worked for you or not, Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film, <em>Once Upon a Time In…Hollywood</em>, has a lot to unpack. Unsurprisingly for a Tarantino film, one of the most impressive elements is the use of source music, a soundtrack littered with tunes from in and around the 1969 Los Angeles milieu.</p>
<p><span id="more-569554"></span></p>
<p>Tarantino’s playlists have always held sway — <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> was the first film I ever saw that immediately had me go seek out the soundtrack at a local store, only to have to special it order it from the U.S. and wait months. Soon that would of course change, and <em>Pulp Fiction</em> became known by many more through the CD than through the film itself, with the mix of esoteric pop hits and wacky dialogue that formed a kind of radio play version of the film, evocative of what took place on screen.</p>
<p>As his career has progressed a large number of his song have tracked directly from films he’s visually referencing – look at <em>Kill Bill</em> for a prime example of that, though <em>Django</em> and <em>Hateful Eight</em> are equally touchstones. Supposedly the needle drops in Tarantino&#8217;s films are from his own collection, or at least sourced from original records rather than master recordings – the clicks and pops from the vinyl evocative as he hears them when writing. It’s an affectation to be sure, just as is his 70mm presentation, but it’s certainly some analogue on-brandness for the mercurial director.</p>
<p>In many ways the closest film to <em>Once Upon a Time In…Hollywood</em> both thematically and musically is <em>Jackie Brown</em>. In it, Jackie is listening to songs from back in the day, her healthy obsession with the vintage and forgotten Delfonics perfectly encapsulating a woman whose time may be passing her by. Within the 1969 of <em>Hollywood</em> these songs were still fresh, often promoting a sense of optimism that was indicative of an era that still held onto hope the world was going to be a better place, that the good guys would win, and that hitchhikers could be picked up with impunity.</p>
<p>Yet what sets <em>Hollywood</em> apart is how the music is being used. Sometimes full tracks play, but often they’re smatterings of tunes, fragments one hears during the commute back and forth from Cielo Drive. Where previously the tunes were often the stuff of “crate diggers” – songs that may have lapsed from popular consciousness and ripe for rediscovery – here Tarantino and his music supervisor Mary Ramos are unafraid to play the hits. If the previous tracks were prime for alternative or college stations, with <em>Hollywood</em> we’re finally treated to 100,000 watt blasts of Californian commercial radio, playing songs that sound good not because of their obscurity nor dismissed because of their popularity.</p>
<p>Take the scene where Sharon teases Jay about dancing to a record, where she’ll tell his friend Jim Morrison that he’s digging on something so positively pop. Here is the central divide – the teenage symphonies playing on the radio versus the more stately, confrontational, or minimalist tunes that would soon characterize the California sound. This is a land of Stones and Diamonds that’s not digging on the Zappas and Beefhearts, hanging out at the Playboy Mansion rather than trolling the Whiskey for whatever the latest fad is. It’s this anti-hipster thread, with Sharon unafraid to embrace the popular and throwing up her arms to dance with abandon that provides the film its most infectious radiance, and gives the film a warmth and sense of happiness that further emphasizes the contrast between historical fact and diegetic timeline. In this Hollywood timeline, minor key songs are few and far between, and there’s always opportunity to bask in the warm sun or wear headphones while floating in the pool, digging on the tunes with nary a care in the world.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key songs from the film, a mix of obscure and mega popular that form the soundtrack and narrative bedrock for life <em>Once Upon a Time In…Hollywood</em>. We’ve also included a full list of the songs listed in the credits for you to explore further the musical landscape of Tarantino&#8217;s film. There are so many tracks to explore, from scores to spaghetti Westerns, brief clips of pop songs, even an advertisement for TV’s <em>Batman</em>, but here are a few of the key songs that help elevate the narrative and set the stage for what takes place in Quentin’s version of late-&#8217;60s California.</p>
<h2>Bernard Hermann – <em>Torn Curtain</em> (Unused Score)</h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmmivI01H2s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Forming a loose trilogy with <em>Django Unchained</em> and <em>Inglorious Bastards</em>, <em>Hollywood</em> plays fast and loose with history, creating a different timeline that constantly plays with what happened outside the movie and what transpires for the lives of the characters within the film. In one of the more subtle nods to that alternative timeline are the several pieces from Bernard Hermann’s score to <em>Torn Curtain</em>. A long-time collaborator with Alfred Hitchcock, the two had had massive success with the likes of <em>Psycho</em> and <em>Vertigo</em>. Hitchcock wanted a pop score, Hermann instead provided this moody, orchestral take, resulting in a rift that would never heal between the two creative giants. John Addison fulfilled Hitchcock’s desires and provided a score as forgettable as that film, indicative of the creative descent of that titanically talented filmmaker. Now with <em>Hollywood</em>, the creepy, rejected score by Hermann has a new and welcome revival.</p>
<h2>Rick Dalton (aka, Leonardo DiCaprio) &#8211; &#8220;Green Door&#8221; <em>(link to version by Jim Lowe)</em></h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="555" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eg7l7UEYMOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Written by Bob Davie and Marvin Moore, this schmaltzy, tack piano hit performed by Jim Lowe made No. 1 in November 1956, knocking Elvis’ “Love Me Tender” off the top spot. As sung by Rick as part of the “Hullabaloo” sequence, it’s the kind of out-of-step nonsense that seemed more innocuous than sinister. A Manson-like, late-&#8217;60s cult leader David Berg would eventually cite the song in letters regarding his own crew, one he’d also rename “The Family”. In the same way that Manson’s hermeneutical hysteria took “Helter Skelter” to mean a racial uprising, Berg thought The Green Door referred to a portal to hell. In 1972, the pornographic film <em>Behind The Green Door</em> starring Marilyn Chambers became a smash hit, eliciting the kind of hoopla that Sharon notices from the premiere as they enter the Mexican restaurant on the night of August 8, 1969.</p>
<h2>Robert Goulet – &#8220;MacArthur Park&#8221;</h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="555" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_RWUD3Kpuc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Upping the schmaltz factor even more, this song about the tragic loss of pastry during a downpour, this was exactly the kind of mass-culture hit that was a far cry from the hippie idiom. Originally written by Jimmy Webb as part of a cantata for The Association (whose jangly 1968 gem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZZEhti1FWA">Time For Livin’</a> appears in the film), it would be recorded in an over-the-top fashion by film star Richard Harris, and then milked for all its melancholic worth by the lounge lizard Goulet. Donna Summer would eventually revisit it in Moroder-ized Disco fashion, but for sheer excess one can’t beat Goulet’s garish version.</p>

<p>There have been a lot of bad things happening at Liberty High, and in the third season of Netflix&#8217;s series <strong><em>13 Reasons Why</em></strong>, it&#8217;s only going to get worse. This time a new crime has unfolded, resulting in the disappearance of a football player, and since Clay (<strong>Dylan Minnette</strong>) was working to expose the corrupted culture of the high school and its favor of wealthy jocks over the average student, he&#8217;s on the police&#8217;s radar. But in the <em>13 Reasons Why</em> season 3 trailer, it&#8217;s clear he&#8217;s not the only one under scrutiny, and plenty of dark secrets have the potential to be revealed.<span id="more-569604"></span></p>
<h2>13 Reasons Why Season 3 Trailer</h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pws-LN_-riM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no actual footage from the new season in this trailer, but it&#8217;s a stylish walkthrough the various characters we&#8217;ve encountered across the previous two seasons, weaving in and out of miniature scenes all connected to each other. It&#8217;s all rather ominous, and it only raises the tension that already exists at Liberty High.</p>
<p>The rest of the show&#8217;s cast includes <strong>Brandon Flynn</strong> as Justin Foley, <strong>Justin Prentice</strong> as Bryce Walker,<strong> Alisha Boe</strong> as Jessica Davis, <strong>Christian Navarro</strong> as Tony Padilla, <strong>Miles Heizer</strong> as Alex Standall, <strong>Devin Druid</strong> as Tyler Down, <strong>Ross Butler</strong> as Zach Dempsey, <strong>Timothy Granaderos</strong> as Montgomery de la Cruz, <strong>Anne Winters</strong> as Chloe, <strong>Steven Weber</strong> as Principle Bowen, <strong>Brenda Strong</strong> as Mrs. Walker,<strong> Amy Hargreaves</strong> as Mrs. Jensen and newcomer <strong>Grace Saif</strong> as Ani.</p>
<p>The new season of <em>13 Reasons Why</em> comes to Netflix on <strong>August 23, 2019</strong>. Here&#8217;s the official synopsis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eight months after preventing Tyler from committing an unthinkable act at Spring Fling, Clay, Tony, Jessica, Alex, Justin, and Zach find ways to shoulder the burden of the cover-up together while helping Tyler move toward recovery. But when the aftermath of a tumultuous Homecoming game culminates in the disappearance of a football player, and Clay finds himself under police scrutiny, it’s up to a shrewd outsider to steer the group through an investigation that threatens to lay bare everyone’s deepest secrets. The stakes are raised in this riveting third season of 13 Reasons Why, as the consequences of even the most well-intended actions can alter a life forever.</p></blockquote>

<p>After two globe-trotting movies with a certain suave spy, <em>Skyfall</em> director <strong>Sam Mendes</strong> is making his return to the period piece with <strong><em>1917</em></strong>. A war drama that follows two soldiers in a single day at the height of World War I, <em>1917</em> has a stacked cast full of every British actor in existence, including  <strong>Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, </strong><strong>Richard Madden</strong>, and Hot Priest himself, <strong>Andrew Scott</strong>. Watch the <em>1917</em> trailer below.</p>
<p><span id="more-569544"></span></p>
<h2>1917 Trailer</h2>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcmZN0Mbl04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>1917</em> will follow two British soldiers Schofield (<em>Captain Fantastic</em>’s <strong>George MacKay</strong>) and Blake (<em>Game of Thrones</em>’ <strong>Dean-Charles Chapman</strong>) when they&#8217;re given a &#8220;seemingly impossible mission&#8221; that takes them across enemy territory in a race against time. In addition to prestige drama heavy-hitters Firth and Cumberbatch, the cast also includes Madden, Scott, <strong>Daniel Mays, Adrian Scarborough, Jamie Parker, Nabhaan Rizwan </strong>and<strong> Claire Duburcq.</strong></p>
<p>The plot sounds eerily similar to Christopher Nolan&#8217;s Dunkirk, but the World War I setting and Mendes&#8217; distinctly different directorial style would hopefully set <em>1917</em> apart. <em>1917 </em>will be Mendes’ first period drama in more than a decade, following 2008’s <em>Revolutionary Road</em>, and will be his first war drama since 2005&#8217;s <em>Jarhead</em>. But considering the director&#8217;s success with both genres, we can assume that <em>1917</em> will be Mendes in his element.</p>
<p>Mendes is set to direct and co-write with <strong>Krysty Wilson-Cairns</strong> (Showtime’s<em> Penny Dreadful</em>). The film is produced by Mendes and Pippa Harris (co-executive producer, <em>Revolutionary Road</em>; executive producer, <em>Away We Go</em>) for their Neal Street Productions, Jayne-Ann Tenggren (co-producer, <em>The Rhythm Section</em>; associate producer, <em>Spectre</em>), Callum McDougall (executive producer, <em>Mary Poppins Returns, Skyfall</em>) and Brian Oliver (executive producer, <em>Rocketman; Black Swan</em>).</p>
<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>1917</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the height of the First World War, two young British soldiers, Schofield (Captain Fantastic’s George MacKay) and Blake (Game of Thrones’ Dean-Charles Chapman) are given a seemingly impossible mission. In a race against time, they must cross enemy territory and deliver a message that will stop a deadly attack on hundreds of soldiers—Blake’s own brother among them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Universal Pictures will release <em>1917</em> in limited release on <strong>December 25, 2019</strong> and wide on <strong>January 10, 2020</strong>.</p>

<p>Rumors swirled of a new theme park being created by <strong>Universal Studios</strong> down in Orlando, Florida <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/universal-orlando-third-park-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2015</a>, and today finally brought the official announcement of an all-new park called <strong>Epic Universe</strong> that will be built in Orange County. It will be the first theme park built from the ground up in Florida since Universal&#8217;s Islands of Adventure arrived in 1999. Find out what we know about Universal&#8217;s Epic Universe theme park below.<span id="more-569610"></span></p>
<p>Tom Williams, CEO of Universal Parks and Resorts, made the announcement at a special news conference in Orange County today. It will be the largest theme park investment in Orlando in 20 years, creating over 14,000 jobs for the people of Florida.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Universal officially describes the new Epic Universe theme park:</p>
<blockquote><p>Universal&#8217;s Epic Universe will offer an entirely new level of experience that will forever change theme park entertainment. Guests will venture beyond their wildest imagination, traveling into beloved stories and through vibrant lands on adventures where the journey is as astounding as the ultimate destination.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, there are no specifics on what properties might be used to create rides and attractions in the park, but Epic Universe will be an entire resort with <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">hotels, shops</span> and more in addition to the theme park attractions themselves. And the title allows for a wide variety of Hollywood titles to be incorporated into the park.</p>
<p>There have been rumors that we might see more rides inspired by <em>Harry Potter</em>, as well as Universal&#8217;s library of classic movie monsters like Frankenstein and Dracula, but as of now we have no confirmation of what we&#8217;ll see in this park other than the concept art that was released above. However, this speculation from a Universal Studios fan does offer some food for thought:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The worlds of Universal&#39;s Epic Universe <a href="https://t.co/yhpUMnMP29">pic.twitter.com/yhpUMnMP29</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alicia Stella (@AliciaStella) <a href="https://twitter.com/AliciaStella/status/1156937111494434816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>We know Nintendo Land is something Universal has in the works, so that makes perfect sense. In fact, the concept art does appear to have some elements of leaked designs for the Nintendo theme park attraction.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the map, a <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> land may not make sense when there&#8217;s already a Harry Potter world, but Epic Universe would allow them to expand to areas that fall outside what they already have. We bet it won&#8217;t be branded as a Fantastic Beasts world, but just something else Harry Potter-related. Meanwhile, a <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> area sounds awesome, especially if it includes a ride where you get to fly on the back of a dragon.</p>
<p>The sad news is that even though Universal Monsters are accounted for on this map of predictions, that doesn&#8217;t sound like it&#8217;s tied to the Dark Universe. Where&#8217;s <em>that</em> theme park, you cowards?</p>
<p>It should be noted that this isn&#8217;t merely an expansion of the current Universal theme parks either, because attendees will have to take a shuttle down from the other Universal Studios parks if they want to get into Epic Universe:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-569626 aligncenter" src="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/universal-epicuniverse-map.jpg" alt="Epic Universe Theme Park Location" width="500" height="609" srcset="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/universal-epicuniverse-map.jpg 500w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/universal-epicuniverse-map-360x438.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<div class="card collection-item " data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<div class="card collection-item " data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>That seems more than a little inconvenient, but maybe Epic Universe will offer up some thrilling attractions that will be too enticing for people to ignore. Since the new theme park doesn&#8217;t have an opening date yet, we&#8217;re not sure when we&#8217;ll learn more, but stay tuned for any new information that becomes available.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-451211" src="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Atomic-Blonde-Blu-ray-700x300.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="300" srcset="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Atomic-Blonde-Blu-ray.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Atomic-Blonde-Blu-ray-360x154.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Atomic Blonde</strong></em> is a cool slice of art-house action. The movie could forever stand alone as one very stylish piece of entertainment, but who in their right mind wouldn&#8217;t want to see Lorraine Broughton kick more ass? She&#8217;s such a thrilling anti-hero to watch, both when she is and isn&#8217;t cracking skulls. <strong>Charlize Theron </strong>is dynamite as the hard-hitting spy, but it&#8217;s still not guaranteed she&#8217;ll play Broughton again.</p>
<p>The good news: according to the <em>Atomic Blonde </em>and <em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw </em>director, <strong>David Leitch</strong>, there is still talk of a sequel, which has caught the attention of a streaming service.</p>
<p><span id="more-569510"></span></p>
<p>Leitch didn&#8217;t say when or where we might see an <em>Atomic Blonde 2</em>, but we&#8217;ve gotten word that a certain streaming service is, at the very least, interested in making the sequel. Leitch would not confirm the company directly when we spoke to him for an interview (which will be running in the days ahead), but he did tell us a sequel is still in development:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there is [still talk of a sequel]. A streaming service is into it. I don&#8217;t know all the details. I was a work-for-hire on that movie, but at the end of the day, <strong>Kelly McCormick</strong> – my producing partner and my wife – she will be involved, I&#8217;m sure, as a producer. That&#8217;s how I got the gig in the first place. We&#8217;ll see.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Atomic Blonde</em> was distributed by Focus Features with great success, but a streaming platform for the sequel sounds like an option. Leitch and Theron are in-demand and busy, though, so who knows when they could commit to the movie, which the actor first <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/05/charlize-theron-atomic-blonde-2-watch-what-happens-live-bravo-1202384673/">confirmed</a> last summer was in development. Presently, she has <em>Fast &amp; Furious 9 </em>and Gina Prince-Bythewood&#8217;s <em>The Old Guard </em>on her plate, plus – God willing – another <em>Mad Max </em>sequel, while Leitch is in pre-production on <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/the-division-movie/">Netflix&#8217;s adaptation</a> of Ubisoft&#8217;s <em>The Division</em>. Whether Leitch would even return to direct a potential <em>Atomic Blonde </em>sequel is unknown, but he&#8217;s interested in seeing how it progresses.</p>
<p>While promoting <em>Deadpool 2</em> last summer, the director said there were a plethora of ideas floating around for <em>Atomic Blonde 2</em>. The possibilities are certainly endless for Broughton, a character I know I want to see travel the world and put her skills to good use. The first movie made $100 million at the worldwide box-office, so there&#8217;s definitely a fanbase ready to see more neon-lit espionage and astonishing beat downs hand-delivered by Theron. One <em>Atomic Blonde </em>fan we know for certain wouldn&#8217;t pass up watching a sequel? Director <strong>Jim Jarmusch</strong>, perhaps the movie&#8217;s biggest fan of all. <em>The Dead Don&#8217;t Die </em>director recently <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/jim-jarmuschs-five-favorite-films/">called it</a> one of his <em>five </em>favorite movies. The man has good taste.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-544725 aligncenter" src="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-costume-designer-700x300.jpg" alt="star trek discovery costume designer" width="700" height="300" srcset="https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-costume-designer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/star-trek-discovery-costume-designer-360x154.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBS Television Studios held a panel on “Impact Storytelling” with four of its showrunners for the Television Critics Association. The panel included </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead to Me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Liz Feldman, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Good Fight</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Michelle King, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Dark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Corinne Kingsbury and </span><strong><i>Star Trek: Discovery</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Michelle Paradise. The panel addressed how each show uses their narratives to discuss social issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the panel, Paradise remained to talk to reporters more specifically about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> season three. Since season two ended with the Discovery traveling 930 years into the future, season three takes Discovery from a prequel series into the far future of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Paradise previewed the sorts of changes Trekkers can expect, and what’s not going to change in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-569561"></span></p>
<h2><b>Star Trek Can Pave Its Own Way Again</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the furthest into the future a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series boldly went was the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Generation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> era. Parallel series like</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Deep Space 9</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voyager</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remained roughly within that era, episodic wormhole episodes notwithstanding. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the first two seasons of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have been set in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a big challenge and a wonderful challenge,” Paradise said. “Everything from what we see on screen, the clothing, the look and feel of the structures, all of that. There’s been big conversations and lots of conversations. We’re fortunate to have just an incredible team in Toronto.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Paradise wouldn’t spoil specifics, but since all departments are addressing a millennium of evolution, we can be sure season three is going to see a comprehensive Trek flash-forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our production designer, our costumer, our props, everything,” Paradise said. “Our builders, everyone is just absolutely phenomenal. Our prosthetics, the aliens that we see. It’s just a great opportunity to see what’s coming.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Phasers 930.0</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple comes out with a new iPhone every few years, so the Federation has got to have a lot of new technology in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re looking at everything for 930 years,” Paradise said. “Certainly 930 years in the future, you would expect that technology has advanced so that’s a lot of the conversations that we’ve been having as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, the most profound technological advance in all of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the food replicator on</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Next Generation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Everyone dreams of having a machine that can make the perfect version of any food you want. I don’t think they’re going to be able to top that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What does that future look like?” Paradise continued. “What does the technology look like? In addition to things like the world itself and the look and feel of ships and all of that Yes, we’re looking at all of that.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It’ll Still Be Star Trek: Discovery</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may have taken </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a season to find its footing, especially with several showrunners departing midway, but they’ve figured out what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now. They can take <em>Discovery</em> into the future, but it will still be <em>Discovery</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we, as a show, I feel like we really found our tone in season two,” Paradise said. “We found I think a wonderful mix of heart and character and adventure and fun and funny and action. All of that together, I think we really hit our stride with that so we intend to keep that tone.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is true to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a franchise. It doesn’t matter what planet they land on or what time period they end up in, the crew of characters always keeps the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adventures consistent.</span></p>
<h2><b>Who’s Flying This Thing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One cliffhanger that will be resolved in season three will be the naming of a new captain for the Discovery. With the departure of Pike, the Captain’s chair remains vacant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I can’t answer any specifics but I will remind that in our finale, as Pike was leaving, he said, ‘We are going to need to choose a new captain,’” Paradise said. “Saru said, ‘Let’s put a pin in that and see what happens.’ Discovery will need a captain. The pin will need to come out. We will need to address that in story.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure fans will have lots of theories about who should be promoted to Captain. I can only venture it won’t be Burnham because Discovery seems to work best when she goes rogue, and that’s harder to do in a position of authority. Perhaps they’ll hire some new future captain.</span></p>
<h2><b>There’s No Going Back </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time travel can make everything somewhat temporary. However, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is committed to a one way ticket. They are jumping 930 years and not planning to come back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Correct, we’re there and we’re living there,” Paradise said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, they say that now. Let’s check back around season five when they’ve exhausted all the future stories. But I appreciate the commitment and staying in the future has unlimited narrative possibilities since they’ll never butt up against </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Original Series</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there. </span></p>
<h2><b>They’re Still Coordinating With Star Trek: Picard</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Discovery has escaped the timeline of all previous </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s, and certainly all the current ones in production, they still coordinate just to be safe. The upcoming </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Picard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be set in Jean-Luc Picard’s timeline, albeit his future post</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Next Generation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet Paradise still double checks she’s not contradicting anything they’re working on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would say every iteration of Star Trek we want to be aware of and we want to honor,” Paradise said. “It’s important to us to do that. Alex [Kurtzman], as he works on that and works on our show, he lets us know if there’s anything that we need to be aware of in terms of history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that’s most likely making sure she’s aware of any new history that is established in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Picard</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She doesn’t want to have the Discovery encounter an alien species only to find out that Picard accidentally eradicated that race from existence, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re also aware that all of the iterations of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so we really want to make sure that we’re not doing anything in our show that directly contradicts something that we’ve seen established or that is being established on another spinoff,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paradise did not yet have a premiere date for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek: Discovery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> season three.</span></p>
