								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here’s a situation that might sound familiar: you’re in the middle of a project, and you realize you’re tackling a problem you haven’t seen before. Perhaps your search function query is returning too many results, which is slowing down your website. You figure you shouldn’t display the data all at once, and you’ve heard about something called “pagination,” which sounds <em>close enough</em>. So, you quickly look through the codebase for similar examples, and then google “pagination” + “[your stack]&#8221;. An hour later, you have 17 open tabs, a growing headache, and no actual progress on your project. Congrats, you’ve officially gone down the research rabbit hole!&nbsp;<br><br>



As the sun is starting to come up on a new day, you stumble across some library code that seems relevant, so you copy it over, and it seems to work. You don’t fully understand <em>why</em>, but the code runs and the tests pass. So, you move on, and everything is fine — until a few days later, someone else pushes a change, and everything breaks.<br>



<br>As developers, we’re constantly researching new approaches, processing new information, and selecting the best solutions under deadlines. Having to research isn’t a signal that you don’t know enough — it’s a crucial part of the job. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/terry-o-shea-455aba35/">Terry O’Shea</a>, a software engineer at Etsy, says she looks things up “dozens of times a day… I’ve spent more than a few sweaty half-hours phrasing and rephrasing a search query.” Learning to research effectively is a significant part of leveling up as a developer.<br><em><br><br></em>



The trap many beginners fall into is following a solution that seems <em>close enough</em>. It’s incredibly easy to get lost if you only have a vague sense of what you need. At best, you’ll stumble onto a working solution without really understanding it; at worst, you’ll find yourself frustrated and way off course. I’ve been there myself while working as a software engineer at <a href="https://bonus.ly/">Bonus.ly</a> and the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/opportunity">NYC Mayor’s Office</a>. There is no perfect process, and different approaches work for different people. However, one trick I’ve found to be quite conducive to effective research is to stay mindful through the process. <br><br><br>




<h3><strong>Step 1: Understand the Landscape</strong><br></h3>




Before you start wading through search results, start by defining your problem in the clearest way you can. Aim to understand, broadly, what the high-level moving pieces are. This may feel tricky at first, but considering how to word your question will help you understand it, remember it, and communicate it to others. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesbmayr/">James Mayr</a>, a product manager at The Muse, finds it helpful to front-load this process: “I try to do the research long <em>before</em> I get to the actual coding; if I have to look something up during the middle of a coding session, it totally pulls me out of the flow.”<br><br>In the earlier example, <em>pagination</em> is just one possible solution to a slow page load. If you take time to explore the underlying problem you’re facing (a large, slow server response), you’ll find other possibilities. You might implement infinite scrolling, refactor your database queries, cache search results, or even redesign your UX so users initially request more specific data. Forming a sense of the landscape will help you narrow in on an appropriate, effective solution rather than chasing a <em>close enough</em> one.<br><br>



Beware of <a href="http://xyproblem.info/">the XY problem</a> — where, instead of asking for your actual problem, you ask about your best hypothesis, and get an answer to a whole other question. As you research, keep asking yourself: “Does this resource help me do X, the problem I just defined?” It might sound trite, but if the answer is anything like, “Well, it helps me do Z, which helps with Y, which is how I can do X,” you’ve probably gone too far.&nbsp;<br><br>




<h3><strong>Step 2: Be Selective About Resources</strong><br><br></h3>




You’ll need different resources at different stages of the research process, so be cognizant of the type of resource you’re looking for. For example, if you’re struggling to understand the <em>concept</em> of hashing (a cryptography technique commonly used to obscure sensitive data), reading a tutorial on bcrypt (a popular hashing library) is probably not the best use of your time.<br><br>



As you search the internet, you’ll find roughly four types of resources:&nbsp;<br><br>




<ul><li>technical documentation (MDN, API documentation)</li><li>tutorials (Medium, FreeCodeCamp, tool-specific) </li><li>online discussions (Stack Overflow, Reddit, HackerNews)</li><li>code samples from tutorials and forums<br></li></ul>




Start broadly — look for a Wikipedia article, MDN documentation, or W3Schools. When I was learning to research, I created a whole website, <a href="https://www.hackterms.com">Hackterms</a>, to crowdsource coding jargon that can sometimes be a stumbling block. Then, once you understand the concept at a high level, you can search for relevant blog posts, tutorials, and Stack Overflow responses to help you write code. If you browse message boards, don’t get caught up in the arguments about which tool is best until you understand what they actually do.<br><br>



This may seem like a small change, but constantly evaluating if you’re looking at the right type of resource will force you to be more discerning, and will save you lots of time. It’s easy to get distracted reading a tutorial that <em>sort of makes sense</em>, but remember: your goal isn’t just to get the code working; it’s to write code you can understand and maintain.<br><br>



Although the internet is full of knowledge, sometimes the most effective way to get an answer at work may be from your colleagues. <a href="https://estherleytush.com/">Esther Leytush</a>, a full-stack developer at Betterment, says her rule of thumb is to “google anything that I can frame as ‘How do I…’ and ask coworkers, technical leads, or managers when the question can only be framed as ‘Should we&#8230;?’ Your colleagues are the best resources on domain- and process-specific knowledge, and can often help you get unstuck. “If an obstacle that’s stopped your work for half an hour,&#8221; says Etsy’s O’Shea, “definitely take it to a colleague — maybe they’ll know the solution; maybe they’ll just commiserate.”<br><br><br>




<h3><strong>Step 3: Write the Code</strong></h3>




<br>As you narrow down your choices towards the solution you actually need, you can start looking for specific tutorials or documentation. Now, you can shift from trying to understand the landscape to finding and writing code that solves your problem.&nbsp;<br><br>



At this stage, make sure you don’t copy over blocks of code without understanding every line. Many tutorials oversimplify the problem for the sake of brevity and clarity, but the sample code they use is often <a href="https://stephenmann.io/post/dont-do-this-in-production/">not suitable for production</a>. Copying blocks of code will lead to technical issues when you can’t explain or maintain your work, and ethical issues around plagiarism and intellectual property. Moreover, by taking the time to rewrite and customize the solution now, you’ll find it easier to understand similar problems the next time.&nbsp;<br><br>




<h3><strong>Step 4: Careful research now = fewer roadblocks in the future</strong></h3>




<br>As with everything else in life, you’ll get better at research with practice. You’ll find it easier to reach the right resources using the right words, and the knowledge you gain from mindful research will illuminate areas of programming that used to seem daunting. “I’m more discerning about the solutions I find,” says O’Shea. “Instead of just copying and pasting someone’s hacky CSS, I’ll keep searching until I find the most idiomatic, performant, concise, or elegant way to accomplish what I want.”&nbsp;<br><br>



So, the next time you run into a scary new problem, don’t immediately reach for Google. Define the problem, identify the resources you’ll need, stay mindful, and remember — this isn’t just how you solve the problem in front of you, it’s how you become a better developer.<br><br>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
I’m excited to announce the public release of Custom Filters, a new way of navigating Stack Overflow and discovering questions that are relevant to you.<br><br>



In the past, you had a few predetermined options on question list pages to discover content relevant to you: Newest, Active, Bounties, Votes, and Frequent. In addition to these options, we also had the Unanswered questions tab for people looking to answer questions. These options have gone untouched for a long time, leaving search as the remaining option for any non-trivial needs. These tools left a lot be desired: it was unclear what the predetermined options meant, our search syntax wasn’t easily understood by many of our users, and our tools for question discovery weren’t unified. We knew we could do better.<br><br>



That’s where Custom Filters comes in. We’ve been iterating on this feature and getting feedback from users in public alpha. Today, we’re thrilled to be taking this feature out of alpha, and you can use it immediately. Here’s what you can expect:<br><br>




<h2>Unified options for question discovery</h2>




You now have a single unified location within the question list interface to discover questions. We’ve updated the user interface for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/">question list pages</a> so that our previous options for question discovery like Newest, Active, and Bounties are all in a single place. This user interface also brings in the most-used options from the previous Unanswered tab.



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6fDx_qjnPNLqcvm4T5ZkUGBegJMdiB7lOrbXewal0aeTPLcnEw7HlyiyzxAecD-YNy9qRFWYOhkhaZSTjyMs6myInyOuL-Alj0dcCVLsb6C4WALBLLEK1P4njsfEo_YcaEYrFQby" alt=""></figure><br><br>




<h2>Fine-grained control over question discovery</h2>




In addition to making it easier to discover questions by consolidating predetermined options in one spot, we’ve also surfaced the filter and sort combinations that power these options. You can see exactly what’s going on under the hood when choosing the predetermined options. Now filters, sorts, and even tag options are available for you to adjust and modify. Not only is it easier to view the predetermined options, these different filters and sorts give you more control over what questions you see in ways that weren’t possible before.



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/J4WNKK1jLeehrZA__CKL_N_qtWTJ3SBYATMKfSIUKWWyXC44mTlm2qufcbPriteOGjaX3GmVAtuV-qcqbOAcSko7ZsrpBPS2JnAWq2KwdLdy315vcRwnEAXy5F7OnJN07XI1PP2W" alt=""></figure><br><br>




<h2>Saved Filters and Notifications</h2>




With your ability to customize searches based on filters and sorts, you can save the combinations you use most frequently with a feature called <strong>Saved Filters</strong>. Once you pick the combination of options you want, you can name it and save the filter for future use. You can access your Saved Filters on the right hand sidebar of question list pages and you will be notified when there are new questions added to your custom filters.



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zmjZyM1XK1R-ZWq4-97yKllcmnzKQih48IGWTQr25dtg8MZ3w5dG1guq3SwX46vqXdZl5ICY4phDPH_Nl4wJdAb6F9uLaMs8_0evYoHQN0P65SU5eVEvKwzmU05iUGixmxwQCAqz" alt=""></figure><br><br>



We’ve been working hard on this feature <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/313940/custom-question-lists-is-available-for-testing">in partnership with the community and our alpha testers</a>, and we want to thank everyone that has been involved during the development and feedback process. Custom Filters are available to public Stack Overflow users today, and our Stack Overflow for Teams customers will see the feature later in the year. This rollout is part of our continuing efforts to make the core Q&amp;A experience on Stack Overflow better, and we’re looking forward to improving this feature and many more with your help. Enjoy!

<h2 id="0708">4,000+ tags are a lot</h2>




These are the most active Stack Overflow tags since 2018 — they’re a lot. In this picture I only have 240 tags — how would you group and categorize 4,000+ of them?




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"># Tags with &gt;180 questions since 2018
SELECT tag, COUNT(*) questions
FROM `fh-bigquery.stackoverflow_archive.201906_posts_questions`,
  UNNEST(SPLIT(tags, '|')) tag
WHERE creation_date &gt; '2018-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
HAVING questions&gt;180
ORDER BY 2 DESC</pre>




<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*_p3SSvQnpVneA5kcFlHlEw.png" alt="" width="1000" height="681"/>

<figcaption>Top Stack Overflow tags by number of questions.</figcaption>

</figure>




<h2>Hint: Co-occurring tags</h2>




Let’s find tags that usually go together:



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11683" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png 1086w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-300x130.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-768x332.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-400x173.png 400w " sizes="(max-width: 1086px) 100vw, 1086px" />

<figcaption>Co-occurring tags on Stack Overflow questions</figcaption>

</figure>



These groupings make sense:




<ul><li>‘javascript’ is related to ‘html’.</li><li>‘python’ is related to ‘pandas’.</li><li>‘c#’ is related to ‘.net’.</li><li>‘typescript’ is related to ‘angular’.</li><li>etc…</li></ul>




So I’ll take these relationships and I’ll save them on an auxiliary table — plus a percentage of how frequently a relationship happens for each tag.




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `deleting.stack_overflow_tag_co_ocurrence`
AS
WITH data AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM `fh-bigquery.stackoverflow_archive.201906_posts_questions`
  WHERE creation_date &gt; '2018-01-01'
), active_tags AS (
  SELECT tag, COUNT(*) c
  FROM data, UNNEST(SPLIT(tags, '|')) tag
  GROUP BY 1
  HAVING c&gt;180
)

SELECT *, questions/questions_tag1 percent
FROM (
    SELECT *, MAX(questions) OVER(PARTITION BY tag1) questions_tag1
    FROM (
        SELECT tag1, tag2, COUNT(*) questions
        FROM data, UNNEST(SPLIT(tags, '|')) tag1, UNNEST(SPLIT(tags, '|')) tag2
        WHERE tag1 IN (SELECT tag FROM active_tags)
        AND tag2 IN (SELECT tag FROM active_tags)
        GROUP BY 1,2
        HAVING questions&gt;30
    )
)</pre>




<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/599/1*gWKNh4zxGmgLLInwsly2Dg.png" alt=""/></figure>




<h1 id="15be">One-hot encoding</h1>




Now get ready for some SQL magic. BigQuery ML does a good job of hot-encoding strings, but it doesn’t handle arrays as I wish it did (stay tuned). So I’m going to create a string first that will define all the columns where I want to find co-occurrence. Then I can use that string to get a huge table, with a 1 for every time a tag co-occurs with the main one at least certain % of time. Let’s see first a subset of these results:



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11684" width="621" height="648" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.png 621w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1-288x300.png 288w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1-216x225.png 216w " sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /></figure>



What you see here is a co-occurrence matrix:




<ul><li>‘javascript’ shows a relation to ‘php’, ‘html’, ‘css’, ‘node.js’, and ‘jquery’.</li><li>‘android’ shows a relation to ‘java’.</li><li>‘machine-learning’ shows a relation to ‘python’, but not the other way around.</li><li>‘multi-threading’ shows a relation to ‘python’, ‘java’, ‘c#’, and ‘android`</li><li>‘unit-testing’ a relation to almost every column here, except to ‘php’, ‘html’, ‘css’, and ‘jquery’.</li></ul>




You can reduce or augment the sensibility of these relations with the percent threshold:




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">SELECT tag1 
,IFNULL(ANY_VALUE(IF(tag2='javascript',1,null)),0) Xjavascript
,IFNULL(ANY_VALUE(IF(tag2='python',1,null)),0 ) Xpython
,IFNULL(ANY_VALUE(IF(tag2='java',1,null)),0) Xjava

<h2 id="a040">K-means clustering time</h2>




Now — instead of using this small table, let’s use the whole table to compute k-means with BigQuery.



With this line, I’m creating a one-hot encoding string that I can use later to define the 4,000+ columns I’ll use for k-means:




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">one_hot_big = client.query("""<br>SELECT STRING_AGG(<br>  FORMAT("IFNULL(ANY_VALUE(IF(tag2='%s',1,null)),0)X%s", tag2, REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(tag2,'-','_'),'.','D'),'#','H'),'+','P')) <br>) one_hot<br>FROM (<br>  SELECT tag2, SUM(questions) questions <br>  FROM `deleting.stack_overflow_tag_co_ocurrence`<br>  GROUP BY tag2<br>  # ORDER BY questions DESC<br>  # LIMIT 10<br>)<br>""").to_dataframe().iloc[0]['one_hot']</pre>




And training a k-means model in BigQuery is really easy:




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">CREATE MODEL `deleting.kmeans_tagsubtag_50_big_a_01`
OPTIONS ( 
    model_type='kmeans',
    distance_type='COSINE',
    num_clusters=50 )
AS
WITH tag_and_subtags AS (
    SELECT tag1, %s
    FROM `deleting.stack_overflow_tag_co_ocurrence`
    WHERE percent&gt;0.03
    GROUP BY tag1
)
SELECT * EXCEPT(tag1) 
FROM tag_and_subtags</pre>




Now we wait — while BigQuery shows us the progress of our training:



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*PJw22Qw-QyXU6WBNKZsLNg.png" alt=""/></figure>



And when it’s done, we even get an evaluation of our model:<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davies%E2%80%93Bouldin_index?source=post_page---------------------------">Davies–Bouldin index</a>: 1.8530<br><a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models?source=post_page---------------------------#clusteringmetrics">Mean squared distance</a>: 0.8174




<h2 id="a331">Performance note</h2>




Do we really need 4,000 one-hot encoded dimensions to obtain better clusters? Turns out that 500 are enough — and I like the results better. It also reduces the time for training the model in BigQuery from 24 minutes to 3. The same with only 30 dimensions lowers the time to 90 seconds — but I like the results better with 500. More on hyper-parameter tuning below.

<figcaption>500 one-hot encoded dimensions reduces time per iteration to 30 seconds, and a lower loss.</figcaption>

</figure>



<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davies%E2%80%93Bouldin_index?source=post_page---------------------------">Davies–Bouldin index</a>: 1.6910<br><a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models?source=post_page---------------------------#clusteringmetrics">Mean squared distance</a>: 0.52332<br>




<h2 id="61f9">Get ready for the results: The 50 clusters are&#8230;</h2>




Now it’s time to see our results. I’ll even look out for some tags I&#8217;m interested in: How are <code>google</code>,&nbsp;<code>amazon</code>, and&nbsp;<code>azure</code> represented in each cluster?



These are the 50 groups that k-means clustering found — given the 1-hot encoding of related tags we did earlier in this post. Some results make a lot of sense — while others give great insight into what are the prevalent surrounding technologies to any Stack Overflow tag.



Naming each centroid is always a challenge. Here I used the top 5 centroid weight vectors — see how below.

<h2 id="4cba">And that’s all it takes</h2>




Are you surprised by the results? Or surprised by how easy was to run our k-means modeling with BigQuery? Or curious for why I chose&nbsp;<code>distance-type: 'COSINE'</code>&nbsp;for this problem? Now it’s your turn to play :).



Check the&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create?source=post_page---------------------------">BigQuery docs for creating models</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/kmeans-tutorial?source=post_page---------------------------">k-means tutorial</a>.




<h3 id="fb4c">Lak’s thoughts</h3>




How would you choose the best parameters? Check&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/247b0630b5d6?source=post_page---------------------------">Lak Lakshmanan</a>&nbsp;post for&nbsp;<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-do-hyperparameter-tuning-of-a-bigquery-ml-model-29ba273a6563?source=post_page---------------------------">hyper-parameter tuning</a>. Lak also had some interesting ideas about dimensionality reduction for clustering via matrix factorization — but we’ll leave that for a future post.



As an untested preview:



<em>Once you have the co-occurrence of tag1 and tag2, treat it as a recommendation problem, i.e. tag2 is what tag1 liked percent of the time. Then, you can do matrix factorization:</em>




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL deleting.tag1_tag2<br>OPTIONS ( <br>    model_type='matrix_factorization',<br>    user_col='tag1', item_col='tag2', rating_col='percent10' )<br>AS<br>SELECT tag1, tag2, percent*10 AS percent10<br>FROM advdata.stack_overflow_tag_co_ocurrence</pre>




<em>From this matrix factorization, you will have tag1_factors and tag2_factors which are essentially an embedding of the tags learned from the data. Concatenate these and cluster it instead …</em>




<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">SELECT feature, factor_weights<br>FROM ML.WEIGHTS( MODEL deleting.tag1_tag2 )<br>WHERE processed_input = 'tag1' and feature LIKE '%google%'</pre>

<strong>Warning:</strong>&nbsp;This post is long. While working through this massive server upgrade/migration process, tears were shed, many cuss words were uttered, along with a general feeling of frustration, which ultimately culminated into extreme happiness once the migration was completed. The scale and complexity of the implementation factor into the length of this post, and I’ll share my thought process on how this was executed, so here goes.<br><br>



When we upgraded to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/how-we-upgraded-stackoverflow-to-sql-server-2017/">SQL Server 2017</a>&nbsp;last year, we didn’t make any changes to the operating system on our main production servers. They were Windows Server 2012 (not R2), and we knew that moving to another operating system would be painful because it would involve tearing down each of the clusters, rebuilding them, and potentially having extended downtime &#8211; which we really can’t have. It sounded too difficult at the time, so it was punted…again.<br><br>



When I was mapping out projects for 2019, at the top of my list was to move from Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2019, because ‘hey, it’s 2019 let’s move away from 7 year old OS’. From the start, it was obvious this would be extremely complicated, but why not start the new year off with a crazy project that gets us in a position to move to SQL Server 2019. I had never done anything like this before. In January, I started working out how we were going to upgrade our existing production SQL Servers from Windows 2012. And in this very long post I explain all the planning, testing, unexpected issues, and implementation of this move.<br><br>




<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Reasoning</span><br><br></h2>




My first step was to identify the benefits of migration. I would be spending a considerable amount of time on the project, so it was important to know what we would gain from the upgrade. There were two obvious wins 1) moving away from a 7 year old operating system, and 2) the move also would allow us to move to SQL Server 2019 (yay… more upgrades). However, the biggest benefit we were hoping for was an improvement with our availability group log transport throughput. Our current production clusters each have 3 nodes &#8211; 2 (primary and local secondary) in the NYC area and 1 (remote secondary) in Colorado. We tend to see significant delays and non-synchronizing databases in Colorado. Upgrading from 2012 to Windows 2016+ would net us gains in performance, and hopefully reduce some of our syncing issues. For me, that would be a huge plus, as I wanted to avoid seeing stuff like this repeatedly during the week:<br><br>

<h2 id="phase-1-lab-testing-all-the-things">Phase 1: Lab Testing…All The Things</h2>




I’m incredibly lucky to have a lab environment to play with. At the start of this project, I had two lab Windows Server Failover Clusters (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-clustering-overview">WSFC</a>) &#8211; each with 2 nodes that were running Windows Server 2016, SQL Server 2017.  Each cluster had availability groups (AG), as well as a distributed availability group (DAG) between the two clusters. Since I didn’t want to destroy these clusters for the test, I needed to create new servers for testing.<br><br>



My goal was to replicate our production set-up on a much smaller scale. From there, I’d work through different scenarios to get to the final desired result. The 2012 production clusters looked like this:



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.tarynpivots.com/image/2019/2012cluster.jpg" alt="Stack Overflow Windows 2012 Clusters"/></figure>



Production had two WSFCs running Windows Server 2012, each with 3 nodes. Both clusters have at least one availability group, as well as one distributed availability group going to a reporting cluster. Once this project was complete, the new clusters would look the same, however, these would have a new OS, new cluster names, and when finished, the primary SQL Server in each availability group would be the current NY Secondary.<br><br>



In order to properly test, I needed 3 servers running Windows Server 2012. Well, guess what? We didn’t even have a way to install Windows Server 2012, and no longer had an image of the software. This left me hunting for a copy of it. Eventually I got one, but then our deployment process needed to be setup to work with 7 year old software. Once all those bits were in place, I was able to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/tarynpivots/status/1083158959937093632">spin up my 3 servers to test with</a>. At this point, I had a new 2012 cluster with 3 nodes (2 in NY, 1 in CO). All were running SQL Server 2017 with 2 availability groups, with one AG that was limited to this cluster, and a second AG that was modeled after one in a distributed availability group.<br><br><br>

<h3 id="the-will-this-even-work-test">The &#8220;Will This Even Work&#8221; Test<br></h3>




Before I started breaking this new test cluster, we had the idea of creating another server with Windows Server 2019 to see if it would work with the new lab cluster &#8211; basically, a test to see if the data would sync. I spun up another new server; this time it was on a fancy new operating system, Windows Server 2019, with SQL Server 2017 and was all ready to start testing. The goal was to insert the 2019 server into the mix with 2012, so it would receive data from the old server cluster. I wanted it to look like this:



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.tarynpivots.com/image/2019/Lab2012Cluster_2019.png" alt="Lab Cluster - single 2019 server"/></figure>



I tried many things to get this to work. I even tried things I knew wouldn’t work just to cross it off the list of things tested. Here’s a brief list of some of the things I tried:




<ul><li>Putting the 2019 server into the existing 2012 cluster &#8211; as expected, this fails due to the operating systems being different.</li><li>Attempting to add it to the existing AGs when not being in a cluster &#8211; this fails because it’s not in a cluster.</li><li>Creating a separate single node cluster for the 2019 server and attempted to add as a replica to the AG. This failed as well.<br><br></li></ul>




<a href="https://twitter.com/tarynpivots/status/1088158572486090752">None of these things worked.</a>&nbsp;I was beginning to wonder how we were going to do this. My next test was to create a new distributed availability group for each existing availability group, using that as a way to insert the 2019 server into the mix. I finally hit on something that worked for the single server. After creating a new DAG between the 2012 and 2019 cluster, I had data syncing between two clusters on different operating systems. I was ecstatic to get this to work with one server, but how would I do this with the 3 servers in a single cluster, with all the AGs and distributed AGs already in play?<br><br>




<h2>The Mock-up Production Test<br></h2>




Once I knew I could have clusters with different operating systems, synchronizing data via distributed AGs, I needed to attempt this with the new 2012 lab cluster. Since it was already working as a stand-alone cluster with SQL Server running, I wanted to set up a test that was as close as possible to what we have in production. I needed a replica of our reporting cluster. A bell went off in my head, ‘Ding! Ding!’ I had an existing 2016 cluster in my original lab environment &#8211; that would be perfect in this case.<br><br>



My plan of attack for this test was to first setup a DAG between the 2012 cluster and the original lab cluster running on 2016. This would be similar to what we had in production at the time. Basically we’d have the following:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.tarynpivots.com/image/2019/Lab2012_2016Cluster.png" alt="Lab Cluster - 2012 to 2016"/></figure>



When that was setup and synchronizing, I had a decent, albeit, small version of our production setup. It was now time to start breaking things. My thinking was to start with the NY secondary server and perform the following steps:<br><br>




<ol><li>Evict it from the existing 2012 cluster</li><li>Rebuild it with the Windows Server 2019</li><li>Create a new WSFC with one node</li><li>Install SQL Server 2017</li><li>Finally, create new distributed AGs from the old cluster to the new one to sync the databases with that AG<br><br></li></ol>




My next step was to do the same thing with the CO secondary in the 2012 cluster. The difference being, it could just be added as a node to the new WSFC, and as a replica to the AGs in the new cluster. At this point in the process, I’d have the old 2012 cluster with a single server sending data to two clusters &#8211; the mocked up 2016 reporting cluster and the new 2019 cluster. Visually it’d look like this:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.tarynpivots.com/image/2019/Lab2012_2016_2019cluster.png" alt="Lab Cluster - 2012 to 2016 and 2019"/></figure>



Before upgrading the last 2012 server, I would need to perform a failover of the distributed AGs from the 2012 cluster to the new 2019 cluster. In looking at this, there was one glaring problem…the reporting cluster. If I performed a failover of the distributed AGs to the new 2019 cluster, the reporting cluster would stop getting data. I saw there were two options:<br><br>




<ol><li>Perform the failover and let the reporting cluster fall out of sync until I could get it everything back in place</li><li>Move the reporting cluster and it’s distributed AGs to the receive data before I failed over to the new 2019 cluster and “hope” things just starting syncing again.<br><br></li></ol>




Either way, the databases on the reporting cluster were going to fall out of sync, so I chose the first option for the lab.<br><br>



Now that the decision was made, it was easy peasy to finish the move in the lab. There was only one server left in the old cluster, so my steps were to failover the distributed AGs to the new 2019 cluster (yes, I tested failing back just in case), destroy the 2012 cluster, rebuild the server with Windows 2019, add it to the 2019 WSFC, install SQL Server, and add it as a replica to all the AGs. Yay, everything was done! What’s left was just a bit of clean up of the reporting cluster distributed AGs, and then I was ready to move to production with the plan.<br><br>



I spent the next week writing up all the steps to move to production. There were a lot of moving pieces for production. I had to move the following:<br><br>




<ul><li>2 WSFC</li><li>6 servers with new OS, fresh SQL Server installs</li><li>5 availability groups with a total of about 385 databases</li><li>5 AGs means 5 temporary distributed AGs to help with the move<br><br></li></ul>




This also meant we needed new IP addresses for the clusters, AG listeners, as well as new names for the clusters, AGs, distributed AGs, and listeners. During my testing, I discovered that you can’t use the same names for these objects, even when they’re on different servers, which resulted in a lot of legwork to get prepped for the move to production, but I was ready…or so I thought.<br><br>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi, my name is Sara Chipps, first time Stack blogger, long time Stacker (I’ve always wanted to say that!). I’m the new Director of Public Q&#038;A at Stack Overflow. I’ve been at Stack for a year now, and I’d like to share with you one of my worst days at work, and what it taught me about the Stack Overflow community. </p>
<p>A little about me: I’m Stack Overflow user #4140. I was in the beta and one of the first people to ask a question on the platform. Stack Overflow has been a big part of what I do for a long time. I’ve been an active member of Q&#038;A, a participant on Area 51, and a lurker on Worldbuilding, Cooking, and Code Golf. I’ve looked for new opportunities on our Jobs board and placed job ads when hiring great talent at companies I helped run, like Jewelbots or GDI. </p>
<p>The thing that really connected me to Stack Overflow and its community, however, is the simple fact that I’ve been a software developer for 18 years. I cut my teeth on MS SQL and Data Warehousing. I moved on to C# and .NET in 2006. I was a .NET MVP for 2009 and 2010 before switching to JavaScript, Node.js, and building Nodebots in 2011. I love JavaScript with all my heart, warts and all. Since joining Stack Overflow’s engineering management team in 2018, I’m back in the world of .NET and on the board of the .NET foundation helping the framework build the future of the internet. </p>
<p>I care a lot about representation in technology, and a future where people from underrepresented groups in technology are hired and succeed at the same rates as their peers. Being a part of the team helping to guide the direction and growth of community is an incredible honor.</p>
<p>We’ve been working on exciting things the past few months to make the site more welcome, diverse, and inclusive. To kick off these changes, we started with the tools that our moderators and power users rely on to make Stack Overflow the best site for developers online. The thing I’ve seen our Community Managers push for the most is updating these dated tools, some of which haven’t been touched since we first launched! The team formerly known as DAG (Developer Advocacy and Growth), now part of the Community team, started by rolling out the Tag Synonyms Refresh and the improved Moderator Dashboard. Paying down this debt will continue to be a priority as we work to get our mods best-in-class tools to manage their communities. </p>
<p>The second thing we are prioritizing requires a bit of a story. When I joined Stack Overflow almost a year ago, I was blown away by how kind and generous all my coworkers were, and the engineering team is no exception. As engineering manager for the team charged with working on our Talent product, I got to work closely with brilliant people I really respected. It was a treat to be collaborating with lifetime learners and natural teachers, the kind of engineers that you would want on any team. </p>
<p>About three months in, on a Friday afternoon, we introduced a new company-wide policy that I felt was relatively benign. What happened next was that, from my point of view, the engineering team completely lost it. No one agreed with this policy, and they made it known over seemingly hundreds of Slack pings. After an afternoon of going back and forth, I walked away feeling emotionally drained. What had happened to my amazing coworkers that were so kind and wonderful? I felt attacked and diminished. It seemed people weren’t valuing my work or my judgment. </p>
<p>I went home for the weekend and stewed in my frustration. I replayed everything that happened in my head and each time got more frustrated with the way people reacted. When Sunday rolled around, I decided I wanted to look back at our Slack conversations and see which one of my coworkers was being the rudest and the most unreasonable. I wanted to give them direct feedback that they had hurt my feelings. </p>
<p>As I went back through that Friday afternoon chat log, I was shocked to see that no one had been hurling insults. There was no one saying mean things about me or attacking my efficacy directly. In fact, what I found was that people had some well put together arguments about why they felt this policy was a bad idea. The entire engineering department definitely made their criticisms known, but I didn’t find people questioning my ability as a manager, throwing around insults, or saying anything that that illustrated why I was feeling so targeted. </p>
<p>That was when something became crystal clear: my coworkers hadn’t become monsters, they were still the kind and caring people I thought they were. The monster in this case is not one person, it was created when lots of people, even with great intentions, publicly disagreed with you at the same time. Even kind feedback can come off as caustic and mean when there is a mob of people behind it. No matter how nicely they say it, when a large group of people you really respect publicly challenge something you’ve done it can feel like a personal attack. </p>
<p>When I realized this, some of the confusion I had seen about unwelcomeness on Stack Overflow started to make sense. In our developer survey results we read things like this:</p>

That was when something became crystal clear: my coworkers hadn’t become monsters, they were still the kind and caring people I thought they were. The monster in this case is not one person, it was created when lots of people, even with great intentions, publicly disagreed with you at the same time. Even kind feedback can come off as caustic and mean when there is a mob of people behind it. No matter how nicely they say it, when a large group of people you really respect publicly challenge something you’ve done it can feel like a personal attack. <br><br>



When I realized this, some of the confusion I had seen about unwelcomeness on Stack Overflow started to make sense. In our developer survey results we read things like this:




<ul><li><strong>“</strong><em>Caustic community for new users. There is no excuse for not being kind!</em>”&nbsp; &#8211; 6 years coding</li><li><strong>“</strong><em>It feels too scary and unaccessible for new developers</em>” &#8211; 3 years coding</li><li><strong>“</strong><em>P</em><em>eople could be less brutal</em>” &#8211; 6 years coding</li><li><strong>“</strong><em>The attitude is not beginner friendly. Askers are expected to have done a lot of research before asking a question (re: both question format and content), even if they are completely new to the community or topic. Not everyone can understand or even know to look for documentation when they&#8217;re completely new to programming.”</em> &#8211; 12 years coding experience&nbsp;<br><br></li></ul>




However, when our more experienced users hear this feedback they ask us to provide them with definitive examples of WHERE EXACTLY people are being unfriendly? There isn’t a lot of name calling or anger, why are they being accused of being unfriendly?<br><br>



People tell us they are afraid to participate because of how mean their peers can be. The way the system is currently built, when you ask a question that could use some editing or is a duplicate, a bunch of people come out of the woodwork to tell you you’ve done something wrong.<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/avINNb1_Dg2h6QfDRJOpnWVFWuokOdxXr_6t97G2jiy-LCbxSrBT8uP5Vs8rWacOnr2za8uPjAhGddAXkMWjipaNOMugKdYv34TtH2PtZ0veQ1S61-QhwaRBLkMjqPLNLaFr8tg" alt=""/></figure>



They could say it in the most neutral possible way, but no matter how you approach it, a dozen people pointing out your errors feels terrible. Not only does it feel terrible, but it can also be not beneficial for overall content quality, not to mention an ineffective way to get someone to improve their question. There is also a big yellow box that gives you the names of engineers that voted your question closed or deleted. That in itself can feel really bad especially as our high rep users skew toward more experienced and respected engineers.<br><br>



On one hand, our more experienced power users tell us they feel called out for being unfriendly even when they are just trying to be helpful; on the other, our newer users and people that don’t participate tell us they think Stack Overflow is scary and they are afraid of judgement. In the past, we’ve prioritized getting rid of unfriendly comments. We’ve seen <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/367768/was-there-an-uptick-in-comment-flags-after-the-be-nicer-blog-post/367769#367769">improvements</a><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/373801/when-is-a-comment-hostile-or-unfriendly-educating-newer-users-how-to-flag-comm/373929#373929"> there</a>, but we still hear people feel targeted even when there aren’t unfriendly comments. This problem is on us and it’s because of how we designed the question asking and closing process. People are using the product as it was designed and as a result people feel called out or, even worse, discouraged from ever asking a question again. <br><br>



Over the next few quarters, we’re going to be taking a step back and re-evaluating how we deliver feedback to users about their questions. We want to make sure people are getting necessary feedback without feeling called out or publicly embarrassed. We will be working on new paths to improve content quality and reduce friction between people. Our goal is to have the question asking process be painless and beneficial for new users and Stack Overflow veterans alike. <br><br>



By improving the way people give each other feedback, we can improve question quality without putting the burden on our users to police the website. We will empower our long time users to become mentors and teachers in order to bring the spirit of Stack Overflow back to what it was in the beginning, a place where people come to share and learn. By thinking hard about how we give feedback, we&#8217;ll help people learn instead of driving them away. We&#8217;ll get more people involved <strong>and</strong> improve question quality.<br><br>



Myself and the community team are really excited to improve the experience that all levels of coders have on Stack Overflow, from new users that are learning front-end for the first time to our respected moderators who have been coding for 20+ years. We all have ideas on how to make the system better. The great news is we have experienced researchers, data scientists, and an amazing product manager that will be gathering feedback from us, the community, and many other places and partners to make educated decisions about solutions. <br><br>



We think the world of our community, and are excited to hear what you think of improvements as we make them. We’ll make sure, as always, to keep you posted. <br>

<em>So starting this week, we will begin highlighting articles written by your peers.  If you have an idea and would like to submit a pitch, you can email pitches@stackoverflow.com. Our first piece comes from Alessio Civitillo, an Analytics Manager at TE Connectivity in Munich.</em><br><br>




<h2>What To Make of Two Major Acquistions</h2>




Recently we saw two major deals take place in the business intelligence space: Google paid $2.6 billion <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/expanding-our-platform-for-business-intelligence-and-embedded-analytics">to acquire Looker</a> and Salesforce ponied up a whopping $15.7 billion <a href="https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2019/6/blog-1-110508">for Tableau</a>. Both of the recently purchased companies focused on offering cloud based BI tools, a space I am quite familiar with, having spent one year rebooting a major Salesforce project for 500 users and the last two-and-half years as an analytics manager at TE Connectivity serving about 600 internal users.<br><br>



So why did Salesforce and Google make these big acquisitions? The most obvious answer is that working with data is increasingly happening across multiple departments, and many employees who are not well versed in programming or statistics are turning to these dashboards to help them understand data and share those insights. From sales, to revenue operations, to customer support, teams are recognizing the value of collecting and analyzing internal data. <br><br>



So what comes next? Will these tools be easy to integrate and actually make the product suites offered by Salesforce and Google Cloud more attractive to folks like me? Personally, I see them as defensive moves, a strategy to protect incumbent product portfolios by snapping up fast growing competitors. If they can tightly integrate these acquisitions, that may help to consolidate usage among existing clients who previously worked with tools from multiple companies. <br><br>



As I look at these acquisitions, however, I think it&#8217;s worth noting another interesting trend. While dashboards are great, I think that the flexibility of simpler, open-source tools is beginning to win out among developers like myself. For those willing to spend a little time learning how to program with these tools, they can provide a powerful alternative worth exploring.




<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=jobs2019&amp;utm_content=headhunters"><img class="wp-image-11745" style="width: 600px;" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy.png" alt="" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy.png 600w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy-300x250.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy-270x225.png 270w " sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br><br></p>





<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Data, data, everywhere</span><br><br></h2>




Tableau has also captured the attention of marketing and sales departments in many companies worldwide. Many companies are using Salesforce already and will benefit from a tighter integration. Customers always appreciate well integrated solutions and the benefits will be even greater for those companies moving their infrastructure to the cloud. Eventually, Salesforce may move their analytics and reporting to the cloud and offer a solution that can work with data across the board and not just their own datasets.<br><br>



So what’s the right solution for your company? Salesforce and Tableau? Google Suite and Looker? Microsoft’s Power BI, Office, and Azure? The key thing to understand from a business analytics standpoint is that dashboards like these are just one relatively small part of the puzzle. Things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>, data prep, and reporting operations are still handled by other tools. This space still has a 90’s era vibe to it. Many companies still push to keep this work in IT but this tends to increase the turnaround times and costs, which is a hard sell in a world where managers want things delivered quickly. <br><br>



While Tableau and Looker are considered some of the best data exploration applications on the market today, they still feel like an isolated solution for BI managers. This is a very interesting trend that I don’t believe has received much attention in the press. There is a growing realization within the business intelligence community that no dashboard will&nbsp;save the day. Every time you find yourself going back to Excel, it’s a recognition that what many business analysts want is the flexibility to design their own approaches and custom tools that fit in-house problems.<br><br>



For example, developing internal business applications is also becoming increasingly easy with solutions like <a href="https://tryretool.com/blog/admin-panel-roundup/#3rdpartyadmintools">Retool</a>, which is part of an interesting new “<a href="https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-rise-of-no-code-e733d7c0944d">rise of no code</a>” trend applications. Making internal business tools without a big IT project is not a new idea. MS Access does exactly that, but what is new is that tools like Retool&nbsp;provide a way to easily build web applications with a simple workflow.<br><br><br>




<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vFLsQqEGo1b2gGDJSjwxgE5dEqmvMnsEzoW0ehgpGkUwjOeyJTN_e7FjFj3QiVNSmOLAFavcfgwfgVLN1JT-HcEx47qRISkDqgO90alachjCFbDPMX6XdHKbwenAbp6avogEaKEy" alt=""/></figure></div>




<br>At work, my team and I are using those tools to build Salesforce and business applications. One advantage, in my view, is that it’s a simpler way to build the applications, but the other advantage gets us back to that magic word: integration. With Salesforce, you are locked in the Salesforce world and pulling data from other systems can be hard. Tools like Retool must make connectivity a top priority to survive so they are extremely good at integrating with other applications and databases.<br><br><br>




<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Industry moving to open source tools</span><br><br></h2>




Isolated tools and processes don’t last long. Integration to existing processes and solutions is paramount. Tableau did not integrate well with the rest of the business analyst workflow and eventually felt like a very incomplete solution. Salesforce might be a great CRM, but it kind of lives in isolation and is mostly being used by sales organizations, so it can feel incomplete too in a way.<br><br>



As the analytics industry advances further, it is important to keep this in mind. Any current modern analytic enterprise solution requires the orchestration of multiple tools sold by multiple vendors that don’t always work as well together as needed. This is an interesting opportunity for open source tools and vendors that take integration more seriously. It’s interesting because open source solutions have a natural tendency to integrate well with each other and avoid lock in.&nbsp;<br><br>



Maybe that’s why <a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io">Jupyter Notebooks</a> are exploding right now in popularity. They provide the type of live feedback users love with the power of a programming language with a rich ecosystem of libraries like Python. With Jupyter, analysts can connect to pretty much everything, can write to everything, and can output all kinds of interesting things. For example, developers like Greg Reda have been using tools like Jupyter for <a href="http://www.gregreda.com/2015/08/23/cohort-analysis-with-python/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3Bo28y9akTSHGJXwWKGpsXFA%3D%3D">cohort analysis</a>. This is a good approach when trying to crunch data on customer acquisition and to demonstrate which subset of customers has the best lifetime value. Here you can see how easily he created a cohort chart that looks good after finalizing his analysis:<br>

<br>Which outputs this nice cohort chart:<br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x5lS7SQ36N4fjYFx4eU5uPKxxOQme7M3Lz6j1EllFsQ71YeP-LpMFhN46TE5J9NGb3KgioJTp3c6oChwQVMr-hvTU0ng_L_QSA6hz-ih0Os5URRNs35seAzpv-zUXVcrea7nA7hW" alt=""/></figure>



Open source is also catching up on enterprise. <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/">Vega</a> is a solid implementation of the “grammar of graphics”, a concept to define data visualizations in a declarative way. Vega shares the <a href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2017-VegaLite-InfoVis.pdf">same theoretical foundations</a> as Tableau, has a <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Python implementation</a> and is already<a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html"> integrated</a> with Jupyter. Vega is so good that ElasticSearch officially made <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/getting-started-with-vega-visualizations-in-kibana">it an important part</a> of their Kibana visualization platform last year.<br>



OK, but what about analytics and BI in companies? Are we seeing a trend towards adoption of open source tools?<br><br>



Airbnb is an example of a company that has put together a custom in-house toolkit so that any employee, even those not familiar with coding in SQL, can use data to make informed decisions. They called it <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/superset-scaling-data-access-and-visual-insights-at-airbnb-3ce3e9b88a7f">Superset</a> and they have open sourced it. Superset is now in the process of becoming part of the Apache software foundation. <br>

Netflix is another example of a company doubling down on open source for BI and analytics. Netflix software engineers even developed their own version of Jupyter called <a href="https://nteract.io">nteract</a> and have few interesting articles on <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6">using notebooks in production</a>.<br><br>



For business analytics managers like myself, the lesson is simple. Management might buy into good looking dashboard tools, but the workers actually doing things with the data need solutions that are easy to customize and integrate. In analytics a complete solution goes from the raw data all the way to the dashboard, the commentary, and the insights. While services like Tableau and Looker are nice, a mastery of languages like <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/data-scientists-mostly-just-do-arithmetic-and-thats-a-good-thing/">SQL</a> and Python will give you the ability to wrangle complex, often messy data into reporting that can be used across your company.&nbsp; New BI dashboards will come and go. More cloud enterprise applications will arrive with great fanfare but mastering the ability to build tools suited to your in-house needs will never go out of style.

<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinbaradmd" target="_blank">Justin Barad</a> had an unusual path to a medical career. He studied biomedical engineering in college, but after graduation found himself working in the video game industry. “I was looking for a way to combine the two, but I did not really know how,” Barad recalled. When a mentor suggested that the only way to find a problem worth solving was to actually work in the field and experience the pain points first hand, Barad took his advice and went to medical school at UCLA. “It was during this time that I experienced firsthand what I think is the biggest problem facing healthcare today: how we train and assess our surgical care providers.”&nbsp;<br><br>



During his medical training, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinbaradmd" target="_blank">Barad</a> personally experienced the growing lack of practice time available to most aspiring surgeons. Studies confirm an increasing number of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Fulltext/2013/09000/General_Surgery_Residency_Inadequately_Prepares.8.aspx" target="_blank">graduates are unable to operate independently</a>. At the same time, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Abstract/2005/02000/Virtual_Reality_Simulation_for_the_Operating_Room_.24.aspx" target="_blank">opportunities to practice in the OR are declining as well</a>. He knew this issue was one he wanted to tackle. Luckily, his detour into the video game industry put him in a unique position to look for unconventional solutions.<br><br>



At the time, one of Barad’s major passions outside of his medical career was virtual reality. He spent a lot of time playing and building in virtual environments and subsequently realized that a VR environment would be the perfect place to practice complex surgical techniques. His early endeavors were simple, solitary experiments. “I just started playing around with Unity, and built the first prototype myself.” It was only after he teamed up with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ossovr.com/team/matt-newport/" target="_blank">Matt Newport</a>, a software engineer with experience at major game studios like EA and THQ, that his vision began to coalesce. The pair built a prototype that demonstrated how to train to use surgical instruments on virtual bone. Shortly after, Barad and Newport founded <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ossovr.com/" target="_blank">Osso VR</a> as CEO and CTO respectively. <br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr4-1200x477.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11236" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr4-1200x477.png 1200w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr4-300x119.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr4-768x305.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr4-400x159.png 400w " sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



VR had a number of appealing qualities in this market, namely the ability to use consumer-grade devices, like Facebook’s Oculus line, in order to lower costs. Furthermore, a single instructor could provide training to a large group simultaneously, even if the students were spread out geographically across the world. The team won the Innovation Award at the 2016 GPU Tech Conference in Silicon Valley and was able to land its first round of investment the same year. Today, its product is used in residency programs including at Columbia University, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and Harvard Medical School and Hospital for Special Surgery. Recently, Osso VR announced a partnership with their first European facility, Newcastle Hospital.<br><br>




<h3><strong>A cheaper, better way to train and assess surgeons</strong></h3>




Along with a dearth of training, doctors today are entering an environment that is constantly evolving. Senior staffers hiring at modern medical facilities often assume new recruits will need to learn on the job, as there are many tools and techniques just coming to the market. “During one interview, I was asked to play an operation board game; that’s about as close as they got to assessing skill levels,” said Barad. This trend of minimal training is becoming more widespread. <br><br>



While previous generations were able to participate in at least one operation per day, recent research indicates <a href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Abstract/2005/02000/Virtual_Reality_Simulation_for_the_Operating_Room_.24.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">new trainees can only participate in a maximum of two or maybe three operations per week. </a>VR is one solution that can help offer more opportunities for training. “This is a way for students who previously had no way to practice, to experience surgery in the OR environment. We are currently working towards blind tests to show that these students perform better than those who’ve had no VR training.” Barad tells us.&nbsp;<br><br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11239" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr1.png 1073w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr1-300x174.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr1-768x444.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ossovr1-389x225.png 389w " sizes="(max-width: 1073px) 100vw, 1073px" /></figure>



VR is also useful for experienced surgeons who want to train in emerging surgical procedures. Medical procedures are evolving quickly, but the training is not. Barad knew this was a problem he wanted to fix. Osso VR is used in eleven countries and has partnered with 20 residency programs. “We are proud that we do not only train thousands of surgeons each month, but we are also able to support smaller markets that would often get overlooked by innovation.”&nbsp;<br><br>



Osso VR partners with the Pediatric Orthopedic Society of North America to create training for pediatric orthopedic surgeons helping children with complex hip conditions. Barad is hoping to see more knowledge transfer and mentoring from domain experts all over: “Think of all the experts that needed to be flown around the globe to train their peers on methods. Now up to 10 of them can meet in a remote operation room to talk with each other, practice surgeries – all in VR.”&nbsp;<br><br><br>




<h3><strong>Remote is built in.</strong></h3>




Osso VR isn’t just enabling remote training for surgeons. It has been built from the ground up to work with virtual reality and remote employees. “We are a remote company from the ground up,” says Barad. “I think many companies these days offer remote as an option. But this results in situations where it is often office versus remote employees, two cultures. We designed all our systems and processes to function in a remote workplace.” Every employee at Osso VR has a VR headset, and not only do team meetings and whiteboard sessions happen in virtual reality, but colleagues also meet in VR for team-building exercises. “We play board games this way. It’s like meeting face to face, just more fun.”<br><br><br>



Osso VR’s commitment to remote work means they are always on the lookout for the right tools to best enable their team. “At Osso VR, we know about the power of people working together online. After all, my co-founder and I met on a VR forum,” says Barad. Osso VR has a team of medical illustrators, designers, programmers, product managers, and sales reps spread over the US, Canada, and the UK. To help them all work together, the company relied on tools like Slack, Dropbox, JIRA, GitHub, Confluence, and G Suite. Despite all these options, the team initially couldn’t find a great solution for software documentation. Osso VR found itself with too many channels, employees confused about where to find information, and internal knowledge that was written down quickly becoming outdated.<br><br>




<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><em>“Once we provided this safe avenue for people to ask questions, it became truly visible, how much need there was for it. It was like opening the floodgates.”</em> &#8211; Justin Barad, Founder &amp; CEO, Osso VR<br><br></p></blockquote>




The struggle for good documentation is as old as time. “Matt [Newport], my CTO, has a lifetime experience in documentation never working quite as it should,” Barad said. So when the news of the Stack Overflow Teams launch arrived, there was no question about trying it. “We knew documentation was a problem, and still only once we provided this safe avenue for people to ask questions, it became truly visible, how much need there was for it. It was like opening the floodgates.”<br><br><br>




<h3><strong>Documentation on the go.</strong></h3>




Barad and his co-founder instantly experienced the benefits. Rather than needing to task somebody with writing documentation, it now happened on the go. “Before, documentation always had a certain stop-start-nature to it. It felt like a separate task that takes time out of what you are doing, and yet is instantly stale. Ironically, the quality of the information we collect through Teams now is much higher than any prior attempts we’ve made with someone working on it full-time.” Stack Overflow for Teams also felt like the scalable solution right at the moment their business needed it. “It&nbsp;meant that all the tribal knowledge is now written down.”<br><br><br>




<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><em>“As someone that runs a company, it’s crucial to me to make sure I understand where the gaps are, and I don’t think it would have been uncovered without Stack Overflow.”</em> &#8211; Justin Barad, Founder &amp; CEO, Osso VR<br><br>

</blockquote>




For Osso VR, the new solution did more than allow more efficiency and ease in day to day collaboration. “It’s also improving the remote culture. As management, you might not even be aware of all the administrative questions that go unanswered in your organization, because employees don’t always flag the lack of an avenue for it,” says Barad. “As someone that runs a company, it’s crucial to me to make sure I understand where the gaps are, and I don’t think it would have been uncovered without Stack Overflow.”<br><br>



Barad is convinced that remote work will be even more standard in the future.&nbsp; As for the future of VR, he is aware that most employees will probably not start playing ping pong in remote VR meetings just yet, but as far as the medical world is concerned, he sees some exciting changes in the industry. “Osso VR’s focus is on training and assessment, but we see a lot of great work in patient-facing VR. Various psychological conditions like anxiety as well as pain management or rehab after a stroke – to name just a few very promising areas for application here. In many fields, it’s a complete life changer.”<br><br><br>

When Anjana Vakil and Natalia Margolis applied to speak at <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/">!!Con</a> (read Bang Bang Con) this year, they wanted to take the call for  <a href="https://organicdonut.com/2019/01/expanding-the-con-aesthetic/">‘non-traditional’ talks</a> to heart while still sharing useful insights. They decided to tackle the following question: <em>why recursion poses a problem for the finite-memory call stack. </em>That could be quite a dry topic, so the two developers thought: “Let’s sing about it!” And thus the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PX0BV9hGZY">‘Tail Call Optimization: The Musical’</a> was born.








<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?r=true?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=jobs2019&amp;utm_content=pjs"><img class="wp-image-11751" style="width: 600px;" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ad-4-Sidebar@2x-.png" alt="" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ad-4-Sidebar@2x-.png 600w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ad-4-Sidebar@2x--300x250.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ad-4-Sidebar@2x--270x225.png 270w " sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><br></p>

“It’s the whole culture that surrounds !!Con that made us do a talk like this.” Vakil tells us. The conference originated from a coding retreat in NYC called the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> (RC). “It’s like a writers’ retreat but for coding.” Vakil, an RC alumna herself, describes the goals of the project. ”There are no classes, just the breathing space to work on your self-directed projects surrounded by peers.” The tuition-free program aims to attract a diverse group of people, offering need-based living expense grants for people from traditionally underrepresented groups in programming.

As their musical illustrates in catchy lyrics like &#8211; &#8220;I was recursing, now I’m just cursing.” &#8211; programming has an inherent element of frustration. Learners need the right support and a space where you feel comfortable to grow. &#8220;The center is very much about pushing yourself as a developer, but doing so in a safe environment,” explains Vakil.&nbsp; “They have an explicit <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules">set of rules</a> on how to be respectful.”<br>



<br>



Like the festival&#8217;s motto, the musical captures that ‘joy, excitement, and surprise’ when you solve a problem and &#8211; spoiler alert! &#8211; their functions get a happy ending. Margolis, who works with Vakil at <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>, likens the experience to her early days on Stack Overflow’s Q&amp;A. “Stepping in front of a group of people to perform a musical as a non-professional singer can feel scary, just like asking your first question on Stack Overflow. But having a supportive environment like !!Con makes it easy to push yourself out of your comfort zone and do the thing.”



<br>



Today Margolis and Vakil get to answer as well as ask questions on Stack Overflow, where the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mapbox?sort=newest&amp;pageSize=15">Mapbox</a> tech-tag brings together an established community of developers using the Mapbox location data platform.&nbsp;<br>

We are entering a<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/why-ai-is-entering-its-golden-age"> new era</a> in artificial intelligence, one where exciting breakthroughs seem to arrive every week. But the roots of today’s AI revolution actually <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/19/a-short-history-of-machine-learning-every-manager-should-read/#3d46fbc515e7">date back</a> many decades. So what changed? The catalyst for the recent advances is the fact that these techniques can now leverage unprecedented amounts of data and computing horsepower. The result has been a gold rush to build smarter machine learning algorithms.



<br></br>



Despite all the buzz around artificial intelligence, however, one tried and true area of AI has been largely untapped: knowledge engineering. Instead of throwing huge amounts of data at a system and letting it learn through extensive trial and error, knowledge engineering uses hand crafted rules to devise a dynamic decision system personalized to suit the needs of the situation.




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>




How can this technique be applied in today’s world? We sat down with Bharath Kadaba, Chief Innovation Officer at Intuit, to discuss how his company has been working to utilize this unusual approach. He explained how Intuit has found this classical AI method to be key to disrupting the highly complex financial services industry.



<br></br>



<strong>Q: First off, tell us a little bit about yourself. </strong>



<br></br>



A: Well, I was lucky enough to begin using a computer and writing code as a teenager at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India. That led me to move to the US, where I earned a Ph.D. in Information Theory and Networks from the University of Hawaii.




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>




My first job, after completing my studies, was at IBM TJ Watson Research Center where I worked for 15 years on distributed systems and networks. In the late 1980s, I had the good fortune to work with the National Science Foundation to contribute to the early development of the backbone of the Internet. During the dot com days, I led technology teams at several startups. Before joining Intuit, I was responsible for Media Engineering at Yahoo, where we built a shared services platform for all media properties (news, finance, sports, games, etc.)




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>




In 2008, I joined the team at Intuit to lead global product development. Three years ago, I &nbsp;assumed the role of Chief Innovation Officer with a focus on exploring and developing cutting-edge technologies to solve challenging consumer and small business financial problems. <br>



<br></br>



<strong>Q: Over the last ten years, machine learning techniques using large datasets have become the dominant trend in AI. Increasingly that means we feed large amounts of data through algorithms from logistic regression to neural networks, tweak hyperparameters, and let the systems learn on their own. You still put a lot of emphasis on knowledge engineering, an approach based on rules devised by human beings. What draws you to this older approach?</strong>



<br></br>



A: It’s interesting that you use the word “older” to describe knowledge engineering. The term I would use is “not in vogue.” Neural networks <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/neural-networks/History/history1.html">date back</a> to the 1940&#8217;s. In that sense, today’s practitioners of deep learning are building on “older” concepts, just like we are with knowledge engineering. What we are doing in knowledge engineering today is drastically different from the classic production rules system of the 1980’s, though they have many connections.



<br></br>



We place an emphasis on knowledge engineering because of the nature of the customer problems we solve at Intuit: personal and business taxes, payroll, and financial compliance in general. These problems are often mission critical, requiring precise and logically interconnected results with a clear and convincing explanation of why the system provided its response. These challenges are often difficult if not fatal for pure data-driven approaches where prediction errors and uncertainty are inherent.



<br></br>



In the field of financial services, the margin for error is slim to none and the need for explainability is high. For example, in a U.S. income tax return, being off by $1 could result in an incompliant return, and a customer likely wouldn’t feel comfortable hiring an accountant if he/she cannot explain why the customer owes a tax payment this year. Moreover, compliance requirements change frequently. Based on <a href="https://ctmfile.com/story/with-a-new-regulatory-alert-issued-every-7-minutes-how-do-i-ensure-complian">a recent Thomson Reuters survey</a>, a new compliance alert is issued every 7 minutes around the world. Frequent changes in compliance laws mean there is little to no data that can be used to “learn” these changes ahead of time.

<br></br>



All of that said, I would like to note that there are a complementary set of problems at Intuit which <em>are</em> an excellent fit for data-driven modern machine learning, and we have a large group of data scientists and machine learning engineers working on important customer problems in this technology spectrum.



<br></br>



But the true differentiator for AI at Intuit is the work we are doing to marry these two approaches: classical knowledge-driven AI and data-driven machine learning. Combining the power of rules-like knowledge with the statistical insights derived from a large amount of data is the secret sauce that gives us the best of both worlds. We have been working in this direction since 2010, starting with our core tax preparation software, and millions of customers have benefited from this work.



<br></br>



<strong>Q: Rich Sutton, a Canadian professor of computer science, recently wrote a popular blog post called </strong><a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html"><strong><em>The Bitter Lesson</em></strong></a><strong>. It argues that time and again researchers have returned to knowledge engineering because we want to find systems that “think” the way we do. Despite those efforts, techniques that learn from data itself have prevailed when it comes to setting major milestones. How would you respond to this argument? Where do you see knowledge engineering prevailing? </strong>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>




A: We completely agree with Prof. Sutton’s point of view that manually powered knowledge engineering systems are often not the answer. However, note that Prof. Sutton is arguing for systems which can learn the rules over abstractions from data by themselves, and then operate via these rules. In particular, if you look at the last paragraph of the blog, you realize that he’s talking about machines learning the meta-methods. In the case of financial compliance, it is rules.



<br></br>



At Intuit we believe that, though relying on human experts to manually curate financial rules may be a reasonable starting point for certain applications or domains, that approach is simply not scalable. These rules should be learned using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. This is not an easy task by any means, but this is the very problem we have been working on for many years with amazing success. For example, we now have a system that can automatically convert a high percentage of tax form instructions into knowledge engine-driven compliance software to power tax and other compliance applications. With this framework, we are now more able to scale compliance solutions globally — an impossible feat if it were to be driven purely through manual knowledge engineering in isolation.



<br></br>



This approach of developing systems that learn abstractions and rules is the path to building much more intelligent products and user experience for our businesses. Pure encoding of human knowledge will not scale. But pure data-driven methods, such as deep learning solutions, will ultimately hit a wall once the applications exceed a certain level of complexity beyond perception-driven tasks, such as image and speech recognition, or for playing games like chess or Go, where millions of simulations are possible. To create the intelligence of a five-year-old child, or even primates for that matter, we will need to marry these two approaches. The fact that we at Intuit have been heading in this direction for a long time gives us tremendous confidence that, in the years to come, we can unleash the full potential of AI, removing drudgery and ultimately powering prosperity for our customers.

</center>



<strong>Q: How do you put AI to work when it comes to financial products. How can these techniques be used to help customers save money or earn a better return?</strong>



<br></br>



A: One of the biggest benefits to our customers is AI can help hide massive compliance complexities, allowing them to file their taxes quickly and get back to what they are passionate about. Thanks to <a href="https://www.intuit.com/blog/powering-prosperity/tech-talk-intuits-ai-powered-tax-knowledge-engine-boosts-filers-confidence/">the knowledge engine</a>, we can generate personalized user experiences fully tailored to their situation by asking them the minimal set of missing information without sacrificing accuracy or violating compliance requirements. This ability saves hundreds of millions of hours in tax return preparation for the country.



<br></br>



Furthermore, with personalized explanations to questions such as “why didn’t I qualify for earned income credits?” and “why is filing as head of household better for me than filing as single?” we can answer the most confusing questions related to taxes right on the spot, which removes a tremendous amount of anxiety and doubt. Such explainability has proven to be critical in driving confidence in our products. Finally, by codifying the tax compliance requirements into machine computable knowledge representation, we can potentially find misses and errors made by customers so that they can get every penny they deserve and avoid penalties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



<br></br>



AI also helps a great deal in our development phase by helping us be more productive and data-driven. Using knowledge engineering, for example, we can speed up the development process of getting our software to market each year with the latest tax codes while ensuring maximum accuracy. AI allows us to convert 80,000 pages of U.S. tax code into an easy-to-use product that simplifies taxes for our customers. Combining knowledge engineering and large scale machine learning, we can be efficient in our testing and verification by creating more compacted test sets that cover all potential permutations of tax situations.



<br></br>



<strong>Q: How does AI, whether rules-based or machine-learning-based, interact with the regulatory side of the business? How do you build a system that is flexible enough to adapt to new laws and tax codes over time?</strong>



<br></br>



A: The answer lies in the architecture of our AI. We designed our compliance systems through a well-partitioned architecture which cleanly separates user experiences from domain business logic encoded within the knowledge engine. At the core of our knowledge engine is the knowledge graph that codifies all the tax rules and the interconnections amongst them. This partitioning ensures that any regulations can be reconciled purely with the knowledge graph, which serves as a single source of truth.



<br></br>



As I mentioned above, as our technology advances, an increasingly higher percentage of the knowledge graph is now automatically curated using NLP and machine learning. To ensure the correctness of the machine-generated parts, we built an integral knowledge engineering pipeline that allows human experts to review and correct any anomalies that the AI flags because of the low confidence score, or when they fail our stringent tests. &nbsp;



<br></br>



We’ve been working for a long time on bringing together AI in the context of taxes and compliance. We started building our knowledge engine in 2010 and we’ve been using it in production since tax year 2014. Through machine learning, we’re able to learn useful patterns and changes in taxes from the millions of users that file with us each year, helping us optimize returns. Moreover, we continuously enhance our knowledge engine and other AI solutions so that they are progressively improving in their performance, getting better over time.

Sometimes it&#8217;s helpful to look back at past decisions and reconsider them in a new light. As part of our <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/12/04/welcome-wagon-community-and-comments-on-stack-overflow/">ongoing efforts to make Stack Overflow more welcoming and inclusive</a>, we&#8217;ve been looking at how our incentive systems, including reputation and badges intended to encourage positive contributions, may be building discouraging barriers instead.



<br></br>



In this new light, two badges stood out to us as different from the rest: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/63/tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/95/reversal">Reversal</a>. In this post, we share the reflection that led to our decision to retire the Tumbleweed and Reversal badges and introduce a pair of more encouraging badges: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/8841/lifejacket">Lifejacket</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/8842/lifeboat">Lifeboat</a>.

<h2><strong>Eradicating Tumbleweeds</strong></h2>




The Tumbleweed badge is awarded to questions with zero score, no answers, no comments, and low views for a week. Recently we questioned if it was <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1576/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-tumbleweed-badge?noredirect=1#comment2615_1579">serving its purpose as a light-hearted consolation prize</a>.



<br></br>



Back in 2009, it was originally intended to be <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1576/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-tumbleweed-badge?noredirect=1#comment2615_1579">&#8220;sort of fun&#8221;</a> and also kinda rare. Unfortunately, we have anecdotal evidence (including my own experience) that Tumbleweeds are not fun and, on Stack Overflow, they are <a href="https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1032536/tumbleweeds-and-scholars-over-the-years#graph">no longer all that rare either</a>:



<br></br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Scholars-Tumbleweeds-Chart-1-1200x635.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10969" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Scholars-Tumbleweeds-Chart-1-1200x635.png 1200w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Scholars-Tumbleweeds-Chart-1-300x159.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Scholars-Tumbleweeds-Chart-1-768x407.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Scholars-Tumbleweeds-Chart-1-400x212.png 400w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Scholars-Tumbleweeds-Chart-1.png 1258w " sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



I included the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/10/scholar">Scholar</a> badge for reference since it&#8217;s awarded the first time a user asks a question and accepts an answer. In other words, the system is working for about 200,000 users a year and failing for about 150,000. That&#8217;s sobering. What&#8217;s worse, the badge reminds people a week later that their question came up empty.



<br></br>



Still, it could be that the badge still serves as a consolation prize. Maybe it communicates &#8220;Dust yourself off and climb back on that horse.&#8221; I suggested to <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/346100/julia-silge">Dr. Julia Silge</a>, our resident data scientist, that we might be able to show the badge is working by looking at all questions that received one (and only one) interaction over the last year:



<br></br>



<table id="tablepress-6" class="tablepress tablepress-id-6">
<thead>
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<th class="column-1">Interaction</th><th class="column-2">Number of Examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-2 even">
	<td class="column-1">Tumbleweed badge	</td><td class="column-2">152,422</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-3 odd">
	<td class="column-1">Got a comment	</td><td class="column-2">30,017</td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-6 even">
	<td class="column-1">Got an upvote	</td><td class="column-2">407</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As you can see, getting an upvote and only an upvote is far less common than getting a Tumbleweed. Upvoted (and downvoted) questions are likely to either get a comment or an answer as well. Obviously getting a downvote discourages an asker and <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311504/what-can-we-do-to-encourage-or-discourage-a-second-question">other interactions encourages</a> them. If the Tumbleweed badge is successful as a consolation prize, we&#8217;d see people who get it asking more questions on the whole. The data does not support that hypothesis; instead, people who get a Tumbleweed badge are much less likely to ask a question ever again.



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.02.13-PM-1086x675.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10970" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.02.13-PM-1086x675.png 1086w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.02.13-PM-300x186.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.02.13-PM-768x477.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.02.13-PM-362x225.png 362w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.02.13-PM.png 1252w " sizes="(max-width: 1086px) 100vw, 1086px" /></figure>


<span style="font-weight: 400">So the Tumbleweed badge seems to be a worse consolation prize than if the system just gave out a downvote. Now you might wonder if Tumbleweed askers just have a knack for asking uninteresting questions. The data doesn&#8217;t bear out that hypothesis either.</span>


<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.03.10-PM-1062x675.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10971" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.03.10-PM-1062x675.png 1062w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.03.10-PM-300x191.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.03.10-PM-768x488.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.03.10-PM-354x225.png 354w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-2.03.10-PM.png 1246w " sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /></figure>



Askers who get one upvote tend to ask better subsequent questions and those who get a downvote tend to do worse. But people who &#8220;earn&#8221; a Tumbleweed do about as well as people who get an answer or a comment. In summary, the Tumbleweed needlessly discourages askers who might very well be asking good and interesting questions.



<br></br>



After looking at the data, we decided to <strong>retire the Tumbleweed badge</strong> on Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network. That means everyone keeps the badges they have, but we won’t be awarding any new ones.<br>



<br></br>




<h2><strong>Lifejacket and Lifeboat to the rescue</strong></h2>




Once we started thinking about badges and what purpose they serve, we considered behavior we’d like to recognize. As it happens, we test badge ideas in our <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/12/12/winter-bash-2018-2/">annual Winter Bash event</a> in which people pursue temporary hats to decorate their avatar. Like badges, hats can only be earned by doing something positive on the site and are triggered automatically. &nbsp;One hat trigger stuck out as really interesting: <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/247415/should-we-make-the-red-baron-hat-trigger-a-permanent-badge">Red Baron</a>. We even reused the idea a few years later and called it <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/289245/can-the-maverick-hat-be-made-a-silver-badge">Maverick</a>. The requirement was: “answer +5 a -3 question that goes to +3”. In other words, find a misunderstood question that has promise and answer it. But that’s not always enough. Sometimes the people earning the hat also edited the question in order to help it get upvotes. (Read about how one of our users, <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/281812/did-the-red-baron-hat-motivate-you-to-be-a-better-stack-overflow-user">Air, went above and beyond</a> to get the hat.)



<br></br>



Instead of one badge, we decided to introduce two related badges: <strong>Lifejacket and Lifeboat. These badges reward reversing the score of a negative question by answering it</strong> in a way that sheds new, positive light on the question, raising its score. It’s an answer so good it makes the question look good by association! You can think of it as like someone finding a diamond in the rough and putting a little bit of work into showing the world its hidden value. Conceptually, it’s similar to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/95/reversal">Reversal</a>, but with a more encouraging twist in that the question itself goes from negative to positive rather than staying negative.

The gold version of the new badge pair is identical in concept to the silver tier; it’s just a lot harder to obtain.

<br></br>



We’re retroactively awarding these badges so if you’ve rescued any questions in the past, that achievement will be recognized within about 24 hours. Again, this is for all sites on the network.



<br></br>




<h2><strong>Reversing Reversal</strong></h2>




Replacing Tumbleweed then brought us to reflect on the Reversal badge. The criteria for the Lifejacket and Lifeboat badges are tweaks of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/277691/1438">Ben Voigt’s suggestion for replacing Reversal from 2014</a>. (Better late than never, right?) Reversal has nearly the opposite problem from Tumbleweed: it’s only been <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/95/reversal">earned 304 times</a> and takes real skill to pull off. Getting a score of 20 is not easy (there’s a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/24/good-answer">separate badge for getting 25</a>) , but it’s more difficult when the question has been downvoted to -5.



<br></br>



Reversal rewards exceptional answers, but often the question gets deleted (along with the answer) after the badge is awarded:



<br></br>




<table id="tablepress-9" class="tablepress tablepress-id-9">
<thead>
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<th class="column-1">Reversal badges on Stack Overflow</th><th class="column-2">Question result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-2 even">
	<td class="column-1">118</td><td class="column-2">Deleted</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-3 odd">
	<td class="column-1">92</td><td class="column-2">Still negative score</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-4 even">
	<td class="column-1">66</td><td class="column-2">Zero or positive score</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-9 from cache -->



<br></br>



For a badge named “Reversal”, it’s odd that the fortunes of just 22% of those questions were turned around. And 39% of those great answers are not even available anymore. One quirk of the Reversal badge is it’s <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/help/badges/57/reversal">more common on Meta Stack Overflow</a>. A typical scenario is someone suggesting an unpopular feature in a question (which gets downvoted) followed by an explanation of why the feature is a bad idea (which gets upvoted). Unfortunately, the outcome for those meta questions is <em>much worse</em>:



<br></br>




<table id="tablepress-10" class="tablepress tablepress-id-10">

<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<th class="column-1">Reversal badges on Meta SO</th><th class="column-2">Question result</th>

	<td class="column-1">963</td><td class="column-2">Deleted</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-3 odd">
	<td class="column-1">119</td><td class="column-2">Still negative score</td>

It’s an interesting badge to earn, but it’s not at all positive for the asker and I’m not sure it always encourages productive behavior. Certainly the new badges will result in all-around better content than most of the answers that trigger Reversal. As a result, we’re <strong>retiring Reversal</strong> everywhere. You’ll keep your legacy badges, of course, and if the question has been upvoted enough, earn Lifejacket and Lifeboat too!



<br></br>




<h2><strong>Badge retirement home</strong></h2>




With two badges going out of service, the list of badges that are no longer awarded has grown:



<br></br>




<ul><li><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/183128/analytical-badge-still-showing-faq/183243#183243">Analytical</a> </li><li><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355115/documentation-is-read-only-what-s-next">Documentation badges</a></li><li>Tumbleweed and Reversal</li></ul>




One of the purposes of badges is to let users show off their achievements. So we don’t want to hide retired badges. But another reason for badges is to suggest things for people to try out. Since none of these badges serve that second purpose, we’re going to place them in a “Retired Badges” section on the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges">Badges Help Center page</a>



<br></br>



You’ll also see a note at the top of each retired badge’s page.



<br></br>




<h2><strong>Thank you!</strong></h2>




I’m excited to announce these changes because they represent a collaboration between many people over several years:



<br></br>




<ul><li>Julia Silge’s analysis demonstrated that the Tumbleweed badge wasn’t serving its purpose.</li><li>Meg Risdal is our Product Manager who led us to make these changes.</li><li>Jane Willborn wrote the code.</li><li>Nick Craver made sure the Lifejacket and Lifeboat triggers don’t break the site.</li><li>Ben Voigt suggested the trigger we used first for Winter Bash hats and now for two new badges.</li><li>A bunch of people tested those triggers on our sites and prodded us to keep considering something like these new badges. We also got a bunch of feedback about Reversal and especially Tumbleweed that helped us understand how they worked in practice. We’ve got an amazing community here!</li></ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The tech industry has created more companies, jobs, and wealth than ever before. But not everyone is benefitting from those opportunities.



<br></br>



Because of financial and structural barriers, people without college degrees or professional experience can struggle to find careers in the tech industry. This has contributed to a growing prosperity gap between white-collar professionals and blue-collar workers.



<br></br>



<a href="https://www.pursuit.org/">Pursuit</a>, a social impact organization, is working to bridge that divide. Through its <a href="https://www.pursuit.org/fellowship">four-year intensive program</a>, Pursuit transforms the lives of adults by helping those with the most need and potential to become professional software developers, get their first tech jobs, and become leaders in the tech industry.



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pursuit-5.0-Headshot-Collage-1125x675.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10911" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pursuit-5.0-Headshot-Collage-1125x675.jpeg 1125w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pursuit-5.0-Headshot-Collage-300x180.jpeg 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pursuit-5.0-Headshot-Collage-768x461.jpeg 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Pursuit-5.0-Headshot-Collage-375x225.jpeg 375w " sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /></figure>



As we continue to work on making Stack Overflow more welcoming and inclusive, we are excited to have Pursuit—the only software developer training organization committed to serving talent from diverse and non-traditional backgrounds—for support. This partnership reflects our and Pursuit’s shared commitment to creating a tech community that is truly representative of people from all backgrounds.



<br></br>



“We want Pursuit’s cohorts—a group of talented software developers from diverse and non-traditional backgrounds—to feel welcomed at Stack Overflow,” Khalid El Khatib, VP, Marketing and Communications for Stack Overflow, says. “Their engagement is paramount to our mission of helping developers write the script of the future. We’re excited about creating partnerships with Pursuit to not only better reach diverse engineering communities, but also the tech industry more broadly.”



<br></br>



As part of this engagement, we recently invited Pursuit Fellows to Stack Overflow’s New York offices to meet with members of our engineering team. They talked about the typical day of an engineering lead and the key qualities needed to succeed in their roles. Pursuit staff members praised Stack Overflow for their efforts to build a more inclusive tech community and provide critical resources to rising developers like their Fellows.



<br></br>



“Like Pursuit, Stack Overflow creates opportunities for people from diverse and non-traditional backgrounds to be a part of a professional network, which is key to their success as software developers,” says Pursuit Chief Programs Officer Rey Fernandez. “Stack Overflow isn’t only an important technical resource, but also a supportive and welcoming community that enables our Fellows to break into and become part of the tech community.”



<br></br>



Pursuit Fellows—individuals with high need and potential who raise their average annual salaries from $18,000 to $85,000 pre to post program and work at leading tech companies—echoed that sentiment.

“As a budding Android developer, Stack Overflow has been essential in offering me approachable explanations of higher concepts,” says Pursuit Fellow Ashley Lewis. “I like that Stack Overflow fosters connections throughout the broader tech community in spite of any particular programmers experience or skill level. I can ask experts questions that I would normally be too embarrassed to ask.”



<br></br>



“As a member of a tech fellowship like Pursuit,” she adds, “I am especially excited and motivated by the collaborative approach Stack Overflow strives for. It allows programmers, regardless of experience and skill level, to be a part of a community that works together to learn and problem solve.”

Last month, we published the results from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019">Stack Overflow’s 2019 Developer Survey</a>, and today you can access the data from this year’s survey for yourself. Almost 90,000 developers from around the world shared their opinions about the jobs they have, the technologies they use everyday, and where they see the industry going. This year, we are partnering with <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to publish and highlight this data. This means you can access the data <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/">here on our site</a>, and you can <a href="https://glitch.com/culture/discover-insights-explore-developer-survey-results-2019">explore the dataset on Glitch</a>. You can even <a href="https://glitch.com/help/remix/">remix the Glitch app</a> to answer the questions you are most interested in! <br> <br>



Glitch is a friendly community where people build cool, inspiring, useful apps and sites. Once a project is live, it’s easy for anyone to see the code and remix it for themselves.. The Glitch team built apps to highlight <a href="https://glitch.com/culture/delve-into-the-developer-survey-results-data/">aggregated and summarized results for our April release</a> of the 2019 Developer Survey, and this new app presents a way for users to explore the data more deeply. The Glitch app uses <a href="http://datasette.readthedocs.io/">Datasette</a> as its engine for exploring and publishing this year’s Developer Survey results. It’s a tool aimed at data journalists, museum curators, and others with data they want to share with the world. 
<br>
<br>



There are 88,883 responses in this public data release; this is the number of responses we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on time spent on the full, completed survey. One question we covered this year was about important job factors for people who code. We asked respondents to picture themselves comparing two jobs with the same compensation, benefits, and location, and consider which characteristics would most influence their choice between the two. We find that different types of developers apply different sets of priorities when considering jobs. Developers who belong to gender minorities in tech rank the office environment and company culture as their highest concern when assessing a new job, and are more likely to say the diversity of an organization is a top concern for them.
<br>
<br>




<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/job_factors-1-1200x560.png" alt="" data-id="10679" data-link="https://stackoverflow.blog/?attachment_id=10679" class="wp-image-10679" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/job_factors-1-1200x560.png 1200w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/job_factors-1-300x140.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/job_factors-1-768x358.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/job_factors-1-400x187.png 400w " sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure></li></ul>




We can learn a lot from the main published report for this year’s survey, as well as <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/382721/data-science-time-april-2019-and-salary-with-experience">all the supporting analyses</a> we do, but nothing replaces being able to investigate the data for yourself. The Glitch team built an app that contains the entire public data release in its back end, and designed a way for you as the user to create “questions” (i.e. queries) to examine the data in exactly the way you want to. Now, if you are interested in what priorities people who code bring to considering jobs, you can interactively explore that question with many specific parameters.
<br>
<br>




<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 860px; width: 100%;">
<iframe src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/2019-stackoverflow-public-data?path=README.md&amp;previewSize=100&amp;attributionHidden=true" alt="2019-stackoverflow-public-data on Glitch" style="height: 90%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>




Glitch focused on questions like job priorities and satisfaction in this app, but you can remix the app and use it as a jumping off point to explore a myriad of other questions. What do <em>you</em> want to learn from this year’s results?
<br>
<br>




<ul><li>Are education level and job (or career) satisfaction related?</li><li>What are the pros and cons of remote work?</li><li>Are people in tech overworked? Specifically who, and how much?</li></ul>




We look forward to seeing what you build or discover using the public data release of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Share yours with the world using the hashtag <code>#DevSurvey2019</code>. Happy exploring!

<strong>Update (May 23, 2019)</strong>: The affected 184 public network users have been notified via email.




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>








While we continue to investigate the recent attack to Stack Overflow, here is an update on what we’re able to share today.



<br></br>



The intrusion originated on May 5 when a build deployed to the development tier for stackoverflow.com contained a bug, which allowed an attacker to log in to our development tier as well as escalate their access on the production version of stackoverflow.com.



<br></br>



Between May 5 and May 11, the intruder contained their activities to exploration. On May 11, the intruder made a change to our system to grant themselves a privileged access on production. This change was quickly identified and we revoked their access network-wide, began investigating the intrusion, and began taking steps to remediate the intrusion.



<br></br>



As part of our security procedures to protect sensitive customer data, we maintain separate infrastructure and networks for clients of our Teams, Business, and Enterprise products and we have found no evidence that those systems or customer data were accessed. Our Advertising and Talent businesses were also not impacted by this intrusion.



<br></br>



While our overall user database was not compromised, we have identified privileged web requests that the attacker made that could have returned IP address, names, or emails for a very small number of Stack Exchange users. Our team is currently reviewing these logs and will be providing appropriate notifications to any users who are impacted.




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>




<strong>UPDATE:</strong> We can now confirm that our investigation suggests the requests in question affected approximately 250 public network users. Affected users will be notified by us.




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>




Our team has taken, and continues to take, a number of steps as part of our response to this incident, including:



<br></br>




<ul><li>Terminating the unauthorized access to the system</li><li>Conducting an extensive and detailed audit of all logs and databases that we maintain, allowing us to trace the steps and actions that were taken</li><li>Remediating the original issues that allowed the unauthorized access and escalation, as well as any other potential vectors that we have found during the investigation</li><li>Issuing a public statement proactively</li><li>Engaging a third party forensics and incident response firm to assist us with both remediation and learnings</li><li>Taking precautionary measures such as cycling secrets, resetting company passwords, and evaluating systems and security levels</li></ul>




We will provide more public information after our investigation cycle concludes.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of companies talk about having a flat organization, but few take the approach as seriously as Expensify. The firm operates on <a href="https://blog.expensify.com/2016/06/03/rule-1-get-shit-done/">two simple maxims</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Get shit done</strong><br />
<strong>Don’t ruin it for anyone else</strong></p>
<p>Engineers can come in and choose what they want to work on every day, which means there is a constant dialog between coworkers trying to understand one another’s code. That involves lots of face to face conversation, email chains, chat rooms, and direct messages. “People ask questions on GitHub and Slack, and those can get lost,” said Nikki Wines.</p>
<p>There aren’t a lot of <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Expensify-com-RVW11373278.htm">titles or managers</a>, which means developers need to rely on one another. To help onboard new hires, the team created a wealth of documentation, but it wasn’t easily accessible. “Our documentation at Expensify has been&#8230;fairly terrible in the past,” said software engineer John Lee. “People would rather talk to someone with more knowledge than to go search through all these pages of documentation we wrote.”</p>
<p>Over the last six months, the team has also begun using a new tool: a private version of Stack Overflow where they can exchange questions and answers and vote on the best information.</p>
<p>“Any programmer knows how to use Stack Overflow, so to have it applied to a single code base is just that much more valuable,” said Brandon Meeks. It’s been integrated with Slack, so that when a new question appears the whole team gets notified and people with the best answers can immediately respond.</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFqhoOC9nvg" width="855" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Expensify wants programmers to feel empowered to work on any project, and Stack Overflow has made that easier. “Everyone has a certain amount of code base that they are familiar with, but sometimes you might know about an issue much more deeply than the so called subject matter expert,” said software engineer Ira Praharaj. “It gives an open opportunity to everyone who has the knowledge to share it, and there is no bias.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have to go through the hassle of finding someone who knows the answer, figuring out if they’re available or online, and then talking to them. That conversation has already happened on Stack Overflow,” said Meeks. Engineers across the company estimated they were saving between two and three hours a week that had previously been devoted to hunting down knowledge.</p>
<p>The tech team was the first division to adopt Stack Overflow, but it didn’t stay contained to them. “As we started to use it and see how nice it was to have a repository of information, we started to see it spread to other teams,” said David Drake. “Our customer support team started using it, our people success team started using it, next thing we knew, we had integrations all over the place.”</p>

Hi, I&#8217;m <a href="https://twitter.com/srobtweets">Sara Robinson</a>, a developer advocate at Google Cloud. I recently gave a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHIEZ-Scek8" target="_blank">talk</a>&nbsp;at Google Next 2019 with my teammate&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/yufengg" target="_blank">Yufeng</a>&nbsp;on building a model to predict Stack Overflow question tags. Here&#8217;s how the demo works:



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SO-and-G-Cloud-AI-1200x661.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10130" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SO-and-G-Cloud-AI-1200x661.png 1200w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SO-and-G-Cloud-AI-300x165.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SO-and-G-Cloud-AI-768x423.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SO-and-G-Cloud-AI-400x220.png 400w " sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



We wanted to build a machine learning model that would resonate with developers, so Stack Overflow was a great fit. In order to train a high accuracy model we needed <em>lots</em>&nbsp;of Stack Overflow data. Luckily such a dataset exists in BigQuery. This dataset includes a 26 GB table of Stack Overflow questions updated regularly (you can explore the dataset in&nbsp;<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">BigQuery here</a>). In this post I&#8217;ll walk through building the model, understanding how the model is making predictions with SHAP, and deploying the model to Cloud AI Platform.



In this example I’ll show you how to build a model to predict the tags of questions from Stack Overflow. To keep things simple our dataset includes questions containing 5 possible ML-related tags:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/so-classification.png" alt="Stack Overflow prediction"/></figure>



<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">BigQuery</a>&nbsp;has a great public dataset that includes over 17 million Stack Overflow questions. We’ll use that to get our training data. And to make this a harder problem for our model, we’ve replaced every instance of a giveaway word in the dataset (like&nbsp;<code>tensorflow</code>,&nbsp;<code>tf</code>,&nbsp;<code>pandas</code>,&nbsp;<code>pd</code>, etc.) with the word <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f951.png" alt="🥑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;<strong>avocado</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f951.png" alt="🥑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Otherwise our model would likely use the word ‘tensorflow’ to predict that a question is tagged TensorFlow, which wouldn’t be a very interesting problem. The resulting dataset looks like this, with lots of <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f951.png" alt="🥑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ML-related <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f951.png" alt="🥑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />avocados <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f951.png" alt="🥑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> sprinkled <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f951.png" alt="🥑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> in:<br><br>

<h2><strong>What Is The Bag Of Words Model?</strong></h2>


When you start to peel away the layers of a machine learning model, you’ll find it’s just a bunch of matrix multiplications under the hood. Whether the input data to your model is images, text, categorical, or numerical it’ll all be converted into matrices. If you remember <strong>y = mx + b</strong>&nbsp;from algebra class this might look familiar:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/matmul.png" alt="Matrix multiplication"/></figure>



This may not seem as intuitive for unstructured data like images and text, but it turns out that any type of data can be represented as a matrix so our model can understand it.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Bag of words</a>&nbsp;is one approach to converting free-form text input into matrices. It’s my favorite one to use for getting started with custom text models since it’s relatively straightforward to explain.



Imagine each input to your model as a bag of Scrabble tiles, where each tile is a word from your input sentence instead of a letter. Since it’s a “bag” of words, this approach cannot understand the order of words in a sentence, but it can detect the presence or absence of certain words. To make this work, you need to choose a vocabulary that takes the top N most frequently used words from your entire text corpus. This vocabulary will be the only words your model can understand.



Let’s take a super simplified example from our Stack Overflow dataset. We’ll predict only 3 tags (pandas, keras, and matplotlib), and our vocabulary size will be 10. Think of this as if you’re learning a new language and you only know these 10 words:<br><br>




<ul><li>dataframe</li><li>layer</li><li>series</li><li>graph</li><li>column</li><li>plot</li><li>color</li><li>axes</li><li>read_csv</li><li>activation</li></ul>




<br>Now let’s say we’ve got the following input question:<br><br>



<em>how to plot dataframe bar graph</em>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code></code></pre>




The inputs to our model will become a vocabulary sized array (in this case 10), indicating whether or not a particular question contains each word from our vocabulary. The question above contains 3 words from our vocab:&nbsp;<code>plot</code>,&nbsp;<code>dataframe</code>, and&nbsp;<code>graph</code>. Since the other words are&nbsp;<em>not in</em>&nbsp;our vocabulary, our model will not know what they mean.



Now we begin to convert this question into a multi-hot bag of words matrix. We’ll end up with a 10-element array of 1s and 0s indiciating the indices where particular words are present from each input example. Since our question contains the word <code>dataframe</code> and this is the first word in our vocabulary, the first element of our vocabulary array will contain a 1. We’ll also have a 1 in the 4th and 6th places in our vocabulary array to indicate the presence of <code>plot</code> and <code>graph</code> in this sentence.<br>




<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?s=100000&amp;c=USD?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=jobs2019&amp;utm_content=rent"><img class="wp-image-11486" style="width: 600px;" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-12.00.38-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-12.00.38-PM.png 598w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-12.00.38-PM-300x251.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-12.00.38-PM-269x225.png 269w " sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></a><br></p>




<br>Here’s what we end up with:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[ 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 ]</code></pre>




Even though&nbsp;<code>plot</code>&nbsp;comes before&nbsp;<code>dataframe</code>&nbsp;in our sentence, our model will ignore this and use our vocabulary matrix for each input. This question is tagged both&nbsp;<code>pandas</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>matplotlib</code>, so the output vector will be&nbsp;<code>[1 0 1]</code>. Here’s a visualization to put it all together:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/bow-example.png" alt="Bag of words simple example"/>

<figcaption><br><br></figcaption>

</figure>




<h2><strong>Converting text to bag of words with Keras</strong></h2>




Taking the top N words from our text and converting each input into an N-sized vocabulary matrix sounds like a lot of work. Luckily Keras has a utility function for this, so we don’t need to do it by hand. And we can do all this from within a notebook (full notebook code coming soon!).



First, we’ll download the CSV to our notebook and create a Pandas DataFrame from the data:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># Download the file using the `gsutil` CLI
!gsutil cp 'gs://cloudml-demo-lcm/SO_ml_tags_avocado_188k_v2.csv' ./                            8231

# Read, shuffle, and preview the data
data = pd.read_csv('SO_ml_tags_avocado_188k_v2.csv', names=['tags', 'original_tags', 'text'], header=0)
data = data.drop(columns=['original_tags'])
data = data.dropna()

data = shuffle(data, random_state=22)
data.head()</code></pre>




<br>And here’s the preview:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/pandas-head.png" alt="DataFrame preview"/></figure>



<br>We’ll use an 80/20 train/test split, so the next step is to get the train size for our dataset and split our question data:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>train_size = int(len(data) * .8)

train_qs = data['text'].values[:train_size]
test_qs = data['text'].values[train_size:]</code></pre>




Now we’re ready to create our Keras&nbsp;<code>Tokenizer</code>&nbsp;object. When we instantiate it we’ll need to choose a vocabulary size. Remember that this is the top N most frequent words our model will extract from our text data. This number is a&nbsp;<em>hyperparameter</em>, so you should experiment with different values based on the number of unique words in your text corpus. If you pick something too low, your model will only recognize words that are common across all text inputs (like ‘the’, ‘in’, etc.). A vocab size that’s too large will recognize too many words from each question such that input matrices become mostly 1s.



For this dataset,&nbsp;<code>400</code>&nbsp;worked well:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import text

tokenizer = text.Tokenizer(num_words=400)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(train_qs)

bag_of_words_train = tokenizer.texts_to_matrix(train_qs)
bag_of_words_test = tokenizer.texts_to_matrix(test_qs)</code></pre>




<br>Now if we print the first instance from&nbsp;<code>bag_of_words_train</code>, we can see it has been converted into a 400-element multi-hot vocabulary array:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/bow-400-vocab.png" alt="Avocado dataset"/></figure>



With our free-form text converted to bag of words matrices, it’s ready to feed into our model. The next step is to encode our tags (this will be our model’s output, or prediction).<br><br>




<h2><strong>Encoding Tags As Multi-Hot Arrays</strong></h2>




Encoding labels is pretty simple using Scikit-learn’s <code>MultiLabelBinarizer</code>. Since a single question can have multiple tags, we’ll want our model to output multi-hot arrays. In the CSV, our tags are currently comma-separated strings like:&nbsp;<code>tensorflow,keras</code>. First, we’ll split these strings into arrays of tags:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>tags_split = [tags.split(',') for tags in data['tags'].values]</code></pre>




<br>The string above is now a 2-element array:&nbsp;<code>['tensorflow', 'keras']</code>.



We can feed these label arrays directly into a&nbsp;<code>MultiLabelBinarizer</code>:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># Create the encoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer

tag_encoder = MultiLabelBinarizer()
tags_encoded = tag_encoder.fit_transform(tags_split)

# Split the tags into train/test
train_tags = tags_encoded[:train_size]
test_tags = tags_encoded[train_size:]</code></pre>




<br>Calling&nbsp;<code>tag_encoder.classes_</code>&nbsp;will output the label lookup sklearn has created for us:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>['keras' 'matplotlib' 'pandas' 'scikitlearn' 'tensorflow']</code></pre>




<br>And the label for a question tagged ‘keras’ and ‘tensorflow’ becomes:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[1 0 0 0 1]</code></pre>





<h2><br><strong>Building and training our model</strong> </h2>




We’ve got our model inputs and outputs formatted, so now it’s time to actually build the model. The Keras Sequential Model API is my favorite way to do this since the code makes it easy to visualize each layer of your model.



We can define our model in 5 lines of code. Let’s see it all and then break it down:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(50, input_shape=(VOCAB_SIZE,), activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(25, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_tags, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])</code></pre>




<br>This is a deep model because it has 2&nbsp;<strong>hidden layers</strong> in between the input and output layer. We don’t really care about the output of these hidden layers, but our model will use them to represent more complex relationships in our data. The first layer takes our 400-element vocabulary vector as input and transforms it into a 50-neuron layer. Then it takes this 50-neuron layer and transforms it into a 25-neuron layer. <code>50</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>25</code>&nbsp;here (layer size) are hyperparameters, you should experiment with what works best for your own dataset.



What does that&nbsp;<code>activation='relu'</code>&nbsp;part mean? The activation function is&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;the model computes the output of each layer. We don’t need to know exactly how this is implemented (thanks Keras!) so I won’t get into the details of ReLU here, but you can&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">read more about it</a>&nbsp;if you’d like.



The size of our last layer will be equivalent to the number of tags in our dataset (in this case 5). We do care about the output of this layer, so let’s understand why we used the&nbsp;<code>sigmoid</code> activation function. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Sigmoid</a>&nbsp;will convert each of our 5 outputs to a value between 0 and 1 indicating the probability that a specific label corresponds with that input. Here’s an example output for a question tagged ‘keras’ and ‘tensorflow’:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[ .89   .02   .001   .21   .96  ]</code></pre>




Notice that because a question can have multiple tags in this model, the sigmoid output does not add up to 1. If a question could only have exactly one tag, we’d use the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">Softmax a</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="c (opens in a new tab)">c</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">tivation function</a>&nbsp;instead and the 5-element output array would add up to 1.



We can now train and evaluate our model:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>model.fit(body_train, train_tags, epochs=3, batch_size=128, validation_split=0.1)
model.evaluate(body_test, test_tags, batch_size=128)</code></pre>




For this dataset we’ll get about 96% accuracy.<br><br>




<h2><strong>Interpreting a batch of text predictions with SHAP</strong> </h2>




We’ve got a trained model that can make predictions on new data so we could stop here. But at this point our model is a bit of a black box. We don’t know&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;it’s predicting certain labels for a particular question, we’re just trusting from our 96% accuracy metric that it’s doing a good job. We can go one step further by using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SHAP</a>, an open source framework for interpreting the output of ML models. This is the fun part &#8211; it’s like getting a backstage pass to your favorite show to see everything that happens behind the scenes.



<a href="https://sararobinson.dev/2019/03/24/preventing-bias-machine-learning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">On my blog</a> I introduce SHAP, but I will skip right to the details here.<strong> </strong>When we use SHAP, it returns an attribution value for each feature in our model indicating how much that feature contributed to the prediction. This is pretty straightforward for structured data, but how would it work for text?



In our bag of words model, SHAP will treat each word in our 400-word vocabulary as an individual feature. We can then map the attribution values to the indices in our vocabulary to see the words that contributed most (and least) to our model’s predictions. First, we’ll create a SHAP explainer object. There are a couple types of explainers, we’ll use <code>DeepExplainer</code>&nbsp;since we’ve got a deep model. We instantiate it by passing it our model and a subset of our training data:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import shap

attrib_data = body_train[:200]
explainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, attrib_data)</code></pre>




<br>Then we’ll get the attribution values for individual predictions on a subset of our test data:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>num_explanations = 25
shap_vals = explainer.shap_values(body_test[:num_explanations])</code></pre>




Before we see which words affected individual predictions, SHAP has a <code>summary_plot</code>&nbsp;method which shows us the top features impacting model predictions for a batch of examples (in this case 25). To get the most out of this we need a way to map features to words in our vocabulary. The Keras Tokenizer creates a dictionary of our top words, so if we convert it to a list we’ll be able to match the indices of our attribution values to the word indices in our list. The Tokenizer&nbsp;<code>word_index</code>&nbsp;is indexed by 1 (I have no idea why), so I’ve appended an empty string to our lookup list to make it 0-indexed:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># This is a dict
words = processor._tokenizer.word_index

# Convert it to a list
word_lookup = list()
for i in words.keys():
  word_lookup.append(i)

word_lookup = [''] + word_lookup</code></pre>




<br>And now we can generate a plot:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>shap.summary_plot(shap_vals, feature_names=word_lookup, class_names=tag_encoder.classes_)</code></pre>




<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/shap-summary-plot.png" alt="SHAP summary plot"/></figure>



This shows us the highest magnitude (positive or negative) words in our model, broken down by label. ‘dataframe’ is the biggest signal word used by our model, contributing most to Pandas predictions. This makes sense since most Pandas code uses DataFrames. But notice that it’s also likely a&nbsp;<em>negative</em>&nbsp;signal word for the other frameworks, since it’s unlikely you’d see the word ‘dataframe’ used in a TensorFlow question unless it was about both frameworks.<br><br>




<h2 id="interpeting-signal-words-for-individual-predictions"><strong>Interpreting signal words for individual predictions</strong></h2>




In order to visualize the words for each prediction we need to dive deeper into the&nbsp;<code>shap_vals</code>&nbsp;list we created above. For each test example we’ve passed to SHAP, it’ll return a feature-sized array (400 for our example) of attribution values&nbsp;<strong>for each possible label</strong>. This took me awhile to wrap my head around, but think of it this way: our model output doesn’t include only its highest probability prediction, it includes probabilities for each possible label. So SHAP can tell us why our model predicted .01% for one label and 99% for another. Here’s a breakdown of what <code>shap_values</code>includes:<br><br>




<ul><li>[num_labels sized array] &#8211; 5 in our case<ul><li>[num_examples sized array for each label] &#8211; 25<ul><li>[vocab_sized attribution array for each example] &#8211; 400</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>




Next, let’s use these attribution values to take the top 5 highest and lowest signaling words for a given prediction and highlight them in a given input. To keep things (relatively) simple, I’ll only show signal words for correct predictions.<br>



I have written a function to print the highest signal words in blue and the lowest in red using the&nbsp;<code>colored</code>&nbsp;module:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import colored
import re 

def colorprint(question, pos, neg):
  # Split question string on multiple chars
  q_arr = []
  q_filtered = filter(None,re.split("[, .()]+", question))
  for i in q_filtered:
    q_arr.append(i)

  color_str = []
  for idx,word in enumerate(q_arr):
    if word in pos:
      color_str.append(colored.fg("blue") + word)
    elif word in neg:
      color_str.append(colored.fg("light_red") + word)
    else:
      color_str.append(colored.fg('black') + word)

    # For wrapped printing
    if idx % 15 == 0 and idx > 0:
      color_str.append('\n')

  print(' '.join(color_str) + colored.fg('black') + " ")</code></pre>




<br>And finally, I’ve hacked up some code to call the function above and print signal words for a few random examples:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>examples_to_print = [0,7,20,22,24]

for i in range(len(examples_to_print)):

  # Get the highest and lowest signaling words
  for idx,tag in enumerate(pred_tag[0]):
    if tag > 0.7:
      attributions = shap_vals[idx][examples_to_print[i]]
      top_signal_words = np.argpartition(attributions, -5)[-5:]
      pos_words = []
      for word_idx in top_signal_words:
        signal_wd = word_lookup[word_idx]
        pos_words.append(signal_wd)

      negative_signal_words = np.argpartition(attributions, 5)[:5]
      neg_words = []
      for word_idx in negative_signal_words:
        signal_wd = word_lookup[word_idx]
        neg_words.append(signal_wd)
      colorprint(test_qs[examples_to_print[i]],pos_words, neg_words)
  print('\n')</code></pre>




And voila &#8211; this results in a nice visualizaton of signal words for individual predictions. Here’s an example for a correctly-predicted question about Pandas:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/pandas-prediction.png" alt="Pandas prediction"/></figure>



This shows us that our model is working well because it’s picking up on accurate signal words unique to Pandas like ‘column’, ‘df1’, and ‘nan’ (a lot of people ask how to deal with NaN values in Pandas). If instead common words like ‘you’ and ‘for’ had high attribution values, we’d want to reevaluate our training data and model. This type of analysis can also help us identify bias.



And here’s an example for a Keras question:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/keras-prediction.png" alt="Keras prediction"/></figure>



Again, our model picks up on words unique to Keras to make its prediction like ‘lstm’ and ‘dense’. <br><br>




<h2><strong>Deploying your model to Cloud AI Platform</strong></h2>




We can deploy our model to AI Platform using the new&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/ai-in-depth-creating-preprocessing-model-serving-affinity-with-custom-online-prediction-on-ai-platform-serving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">custom code</a> feature. This will let us write custom server-side Python code that’s run at prediction time. Since we need to transform our text into a bag of words matrix before passing it to our model for prediction, this feature will be especially useful. We’ll be able to keep our client super simple by passing the raw text directly to our model and letting the server handle transformations. We can implement this by writing a Python class where we do any feature pre-processing or post-processing on the value returned by our model.



First we’ll turn our Keras code from above into a&nbsp;<code>TextPreprocessor</code>&nbsp;class (adapted from&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/ai-in-depth-creating-preprocessing-model-serving-affinity-with-custom-online-prediction-on-ai-platform-serving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">this post</a>). The&nbsp;<code>create_tokenizer</code>&nbsp;method instantiates a tokenizer object with a provided vocabulary size, and&nbsp;<code>transform_text</code>converts text into a bag of words matrix.<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import text

class TextPreprocessor(object):
  def __init__(self, vocab_size):
    self._vocab_size = vocab_size
    self._tokenizer = None
  
  def create_tokenizer(self, text_list):
    tokenizer = text.Tokenizer(num_words=self._vocab_size)
    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(text_list)
    self._tokenizer = tokenizer

  def transform_text(self, text_list):
    text_matrix = self._tokenizer.texts_to_matrix(text_list)
    return text_matrix</code></pre>




Then, our custom prediction class makes use of this to pre-process text and returns predictions as a list of sigmoid probabilities:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>import pickle
import os
import numpy as np

class CustomModelPrediction(object):

  def __init__(self, model, processor):
    self._model = model
    self._processor = processor
  
  def predict(self, instances, **kwargs):
    preprocessed_data = self._processor.transform_text(instances)
    predictions = self._model.predict(preprocessed_data)
    return predictions.tolist()

  @classmethod
  def from_path(cls, model_dir):
    import tensorflow.keras as keras
    model = keras.models.load_model(
      os.path.join(model_dir,'keras_saved_model.h5'))
    with open(os.path.join(model_dir, 'processor_state.pkl'), 'rb') as f:
      processor = pickle.load(f)

    return cls(model, processor)</code></pre>




To deploy the model on AI Platform you’ll need to have a&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects">Goo</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="g (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects" target="_blank">g</a><a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects">le Cloud Proje</a><a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="c (opens in a new tab)">c</a><a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects">t</a>&nbsp;along with a Cloud Storage bucket &#8211; this is where you’ll put your saved model file and other assets.



First you’ll want to create your model in AI Platform using the&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">gcloud CLI</a>&nbsp;(add a&nbsp;<code>!</code>&nbsp;in front of the gcloud command if you’re running this from a Python notebook). We’ll create the model with the following:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>gcloud ai-platform models create your_model_name</code></pre>




Then you can deploy your model using&nbsp;<code>gcloud beta ai-platform versions create</code>. The&nbsp;<code>--prediction-class</code>flag points our model to the Python code it should run at prediction time:<br><br>




<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>gcloud beta ai-platform versions create v1 --model your_model_name \
--origin=gs://your_model_bucket/ \
--python-version=3.5 \
--runtime-version=1.13 \
--framework='TENSORFLOW' \
--package-uris=gs://your_model_bucket/packages/so_predict-0.1.tar.gz \
--prediction-class=prediction_class_file.CustomModelPredictionName</code></pre>




If you navigate to the AI Platform Models section of your Cloud console you should see your model deployed within a few minutes:<br><br>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://sararobinson.dev/assets/media/deployed-model.png" alt="Deployed model UI"/></figure>



Woohoo! We’ve got our model deployed along with some custom code for pre-processing text. Note that we could also make use of the custom code feature for post-processing. If I did that, I could put all of the SHAP logic discussed above into a new method in order to return SHAP attributions to the client and display them to the end user.

TL;DR If you’ve been using our Stack Overflow for Teams product and are part of a growing company, we’ve got exciting news. Today we’re launching a new tier, Stack Overflow for Business, that includes a lot of features customers have been asking for. You can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=so4b-launch&amp;utm_content=launch-blog">learn more here</a>. If you’re not familiar with what the private version of Stack Overflow can do to help your organization work smarter, read on.<br><br>




<div style="display: block; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin: 0 auto;"><iframe style="display: block; position: absolute; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJtJXMKpl2g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>




<br><br>It’s been nearly two decades since Tim O’Reilly coined the term inner sourcing, which advocated for applying the principles of open source development beyond the IT department, leveraging those ideas to improve communication and collaboration across corporations of varying sizes and industries. Since then software has become a critical piece of nearly every business, and in order to succeed the best companies need to draw on ideas from across their organization and find ways to ensure that the best contributions bubble to the top.<br><br>

How do you crowdsource great information from within your own workforce? Stack Overflow learned a lot about community building and knowledge management in the decade we spent building our public facing website. It became a living compendium of great questions and answers for software developers. A few years ago we realized that this same structure might be valuable if turned inward, and so we began to launch private instances of Stack Overflow for clients like Microsoft and Bloomberg.<br><br>

That product grew into Stack Overflow for Enterprise, now used by Fortune 500 companies across tech, finance, and telecom. A year ago we launched Stack Overflow for Teams, allowing smaller organizations to tap into this same offering. Since then we’ve signed up 1,500 customers and 30,000 users ranging from startups to universities. At Expensify, one of our early customers, our Q&amp;A offering has become an indispensable tool for the engineering team, but it has also been adopted by the entire company in order to access knowledge on topics such as customers success and data collection.<br><br>

<table style="width: 90%; border-left: 5px solid #d6d9dc; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 100%; padding-left: 20px;">
It originally started as a place just for engineers because engineers were kind of used to it with the original Stack Overflow. But as we started to use it and see how nice it was to have a repository of information we started to see it spread to other teams so our customer support team started using it, our people success team started using it. Next thing we knew we had integrations all over the place and Stack Overflow being used across the company.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<br>As Teams and Enterprise have grown, we’ve begun to see a few areas where we could improve the fit. In classic Goldilocks fashion, there were some customers for whom Enterprise was a bit too big, and Teams was a bit too small. So today we’re rolling out a third tier, Stack Overflow for Business, which will sit in between those two. We think it’s best suited for organizations with 50 to 1,000 users, but we’re happy to chat with anyone who is interested.<br><br>



At a high level, the product will remain the same, but there are a couple of key features to note:<br><br>




<ul><li>Single Sign On (SSO) </li><li>Invoice or Credit Card </li><li>Analytics dashboard </li><li>Priority Customer Support </li><li>Stayed tuned! We’re working on lots more features geared to Business users </li></ul>




When it becomes simple for anyone in your organization to share questions and answers, and when great ideas are rewarded and recognized, it’s like creating a giant incubator that exists to grow your business. A living dialog of this kind gives managers superpowers, the ability to see around corners and anticipate what problems need fixing and what products might be used in ways the original creators never imagined. If you’re interested in learning more about your own private version of Stack Overflow, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://stackoverflow.com/business/get-started?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=so4b-launch&amp;utm_content=launch-blog" target="_blank">get in touch here</a>.

<br>

Stack Overflow’s annual Developer Survey is the largest and most comprehensive survey of people who code around the world, but our results don&#8217;t represent everyone in the developer community evenly. We have further work to do to make Stack Overflow the welcoming, inclusive, and diverse platform we want it to be, and this is reflected in our survey sample. We are committed to building on <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/01/18/state-of-the-stack-2019-a-year-in-review/">steps we’ve taken in the past year</a> and improving in this area this year and beyond. Some of these survey results directly guide those efforts.

<br>
<br>

To address these characteristics of our survey sample, we often summarize results by country or gender, highlight results for underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, or use survey weighting to correct for demographic skew. Be sure to check out where we&#8217;ve pointed out these kinds of differences.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Big news! We’re looking for a new CEO for Stack Overflow. I’m stepping out of the day-to-day and up to the role of Chairman of the Board. Stack Overflow has been around for more than a decade. As I look back, it’s really amazing how far it has come.  Only six months after we had launched Stack Overflow, my co-founder Jeff Atwood and I were invited to speak at a Microsoft conference for developers in Las Vegas. We were there, I think, to demonstrate that you could use their latest ASP.NET MVC technology on a real website without too much of a disaster. (In fact .NET has been a huge, unmitigated success for us, but you kids go ahead and have fun with whatever platform you want mkay? They’re all great, or, at least, above-average).It was a giant conference, held at the Venetian Hotel. This hotel was so big that other hotels stay there when they go on vacation. The main ballroom was the size of, approximately, Ireland. I later learned there were 5,000 developers in that room.I thought it would be a fun thing to ask the developers in the room how many of them had visited Stack Overflow. As I remember, Jeff was very much against this idea. “Joel,” he said, “That is going to be embarrassing and humiliating. Nobody is going to raise their hand.”Well, I asked it anyway. And we were both surprised to see about one-third of the hands go up. We were really making an impact! That felt really good.Anyway, I tried that trick again whenever I spoke to a large audience. It doesn’t work anymore. Today, audiences just laugh. It’s like asking, “Does anyone use gravity? Raise your hand if you use gravity.”Where are we at after 11 years? Practically every developer in the world uses Stack Overflow. Including the Stack Exchange network of 174 sites, we have over 100 million monthly visitors. Every month, over 125,000 wonderful people write answers. According to Alexa, stackoverflow.com is one of the top 50 websites in the world. (That’s without even counting the Stack Exchange network, which is almost as big.) And every time I see a developer write code, they’ve got Stack Overflow open in one of their browser windows. Oh and—hey!—we do not make you sign up or pay to see the answers.The company has been growing, too. Today we are profitable. We have almost 300 amazing employees worldwide and booked $70m in revenue last year. We have talent, advertising, and software products. The SaaS products (Stack Overflow for Teams and Enterprise) are growing at 200% a year. That speaks to the fact that we’ve recruited an incredibly talented team that has produced such fantastic results. But, we have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s going to take a different type of leader to get us through that work. The type of people Stack Overflow serves has changed, and now, as a part of the developer ecosystem, we have a responsibility to create an online community that is far more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming of newcomers. In the decade or so since Stack Overflow started, the number of people employed as software developers grew by 64% in the US alone. The field is going to keep growing everywhere in the world, and the demand for great software developers far outstrips supply. So a big challenge for Stack Overflow is welcoming those new developers into the fold. As I’ve written:One thing I’m very concerned about, as we try to educate the next generation of developers, and, importantly, get more diversity and inclusiveness in that new generation, is what obstacles we’re putting up for people as they try to learn programming. In many ways Stack Overflow’s specific rules for what is permitted and what is not are obstacles, but an even bigger problem is rudeness, snark, or condescension that newcomers often see.I care a lot about this. Being a developer gives you an unparalleled opportunity to write the script for the future. All the flak that Stack Overflow throws in the face of newbies trying to become developers is actively harmful to people, to society, and to Stack Overflow itself, by driving away potential future contributors. And programming is hard enough; we should see our mission as making it easier.The world has started taking a closer look at tech, and understanding that software and the internet are not just tools; they are shaping the future of society. Big tech companies are struggling with their place in the world. Stack Overflow is situated at the right place to be influential in how that future develops, and that is going to take a new type of leader.It will not be easy to find a CEO who is the right person to lead that mission. We will, no doubt, hire one of those fancy executive headhunters to help us in the search. But, hey, this is Stack Overflow. If there’s one thing I have learned by now, it’s that there’s always someone in the community who can answer the questions I can’t. So we decided to put this announcement out there in hopes of finding great candidates that might have been under the radar.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p style="text-align:left">Big news! We’re looking for a new CEO for Stack Overflow. I’m stepping out of the day-to-day and up to the role of Chairman of the Board. <br><br>Stack Overflow has been around for more than a decade. As I look back, it’s really amazing how far it has come.  <br><br>Only six months after we had launched Stack Overflow, my co-founder Jeff Atwood and I were invited to speak at a Microsoft conference for developers in Las Vegas. We were there, I think, to demonstrate that you could use their latest ASP.NET MVC technology on a real website without too much of a disaster. (In fact .NET has been a huge, unmitigated success for us, but you kids go ahead and have fun with whatever platform you want mkay? They’re all great, or, at least, above-average).<br><br>It was a giant conference, held at the Venetian Hotel. This hotel was so big that other <em>hotels</em> stay there when they go on vacation. The main ballroom was the size of, approximately, Ireland. I later learned there were 5,000 developers in that room.<br><br>I thought it would be a fun thing to ask the developers in the room how many of them had visited Stack Overflow. As I remember, Jeff was very much against this idea. “Joel,” he said, “That is going to be embarrassing and humiliating. Nobody is going to raise their hand.”<br><br>Well, I asked it anyway. And we were both surprised to see about one-third of the hands go up. We were really making an impact! That felt really good.<br><br>Anyway, I tried that trick again whenever I spoke to a large audience. It doesn’t work anymore. Today, audiences just laugh. It’s like asking, “Does anyone use gravity? Raise your hand if you use gravity.”<br><br>Where are we at after 11 years? Practically every developer in the world uses Stack Overflow. Including the Stack Exchange network of 174 sites, we have over 100 million monthly visitors. Every month, over 125,000 wonderful people write answers. According to Alexa, <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com is one of the top 50 websites in the world</a>. (That’s without even counting the Stack Exchange network, which is almost as big.) And every time I see a developer write code, they’ve got Stack Overflow open in one of their browser windows. Oh and—hey!—we do not make you sign up or pay to see the answers.<br><br>The company has been growing, too. Today we are profitable. We have almost 300 amazing employees worldwide and booked $70m in revenue last year. We have talent, advertising, and software products. The SaaS products (Stack Overflow for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams">Teams</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/enterprise">Enterprise</a>) are growing at <em>200% a year</em>. That speaks to the fact that we’ve recruited an incredibly talented team that has produced such fantastic results. <br><br>But, we have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s going to take a different type of leader to get us through that work. <br><br>The type of people Stack Overflow serves has changed, and now, as a part of the developer ecosystem, we have a responsibility to create an online community that is far more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming of newcomers. In the decade or so since Stack Overflow started, the number of people employed as software developers <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2019/data-on-display/projections-evaluation.htm?view_full">grew by 64%</a> in the US alone. The field is going to keep growing everywhere in the world, and the demand for great software developers far outstrips supply. So a big challenge for Stack Overflow is welcoming those new developers into the fold. As I’ve <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/04/23/strange-and-maddening-rules/">written</a>:<br><br><em>One thing I’m very concerned about, as we try to educate the next generation of developers, and, importantly, get more diversity and inclusiveness in that new generation, is what obstacles we’re putting up for people as they try to learn programming. In many ways Stack Overflow’s specific rules for what is permitted and what is not are obstacles, but an even bigger problem is rudeness, snark, or condescension that newcomers often see.<br><br>I care a lot about this. Being a developer gives you an unparalleled opportunity to write the script for the future. All the flak that Stack Overflow throws in the face of newbies trying to become developers is actively harmful to people, to society, and to Stack Overflow itself, by driving away potential future contributors. And programming is hard enough; we should see our mission as making it easier.</em><br><br>The world has started taking a closer look at tech, and understanding that software and the internet are not just tools; they are shaping the future of society. Big tech companies are struggling with their place in the world. Stack Overflow is situated at the right place to be influential in how that future develops, and that is going to take a new type of leader.<br><br>It will not be easy to find a CEO who is the right person to lead that mission. We will, no doubt, hire one of those fancy executive headhunters to help us in the search. But, hey, this is Stack Overflow. If there’s one thing I have learned by now, it’s that there’s always someone in the community who can answer the questions I can’t. <br><br>So we decided to put this announcement out there in hopes of finding great candidates that might have been under the radar. We’re especially focused on identifying candidates from under-represented groups, and making sure that every candidate we consider is deeply committed to making our company and community more welcoming, diverse, and inclusive.<br><br>Over the years, Fog Creek Software created several incredible hits and many wonderful memories along the way. It is great to watch Trello (under Michael Pryor) and Glitch (under Anil Dash) growing into enormously valuable, successful, and influential products with dedicated leaders who took these products much further than I ever could have, and personally I’m excited to see where Stack Overflow can go and turn my attention to the next thing.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/01/18/state-of-the-stack-2019-a-year-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an exciting end to 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we kicked this year off with the first “hackathon” in Stack Overflow&#8217;s 10-year history. Unlike a traditional hackathon, it wasn&#8217;t just for our developers. Any employee working on our products or directly with the Stack Overflow community was encouraged to participate, which is why we dubbed the event a &#8220;Make-A-Thon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees from our engineering, design, and support teams spent a full week working on projects outside of their typical day-to-day responsibilities. For our inaugural Make-A-Thon, participants brainstormed improvements to our power user and moderator experience on Stack Overflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a recap of what we hoped for when we announced the Make-A-Thon, what the outcomes were, and what we learned from the experience.</span></p>
<h2>A Make-A-Thon with “Anti-Goals”</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hackathon participants often hope to create working prototypes, that wasn&#8217;t a goal for our first Make-A-Thon. In fact, Design Manager and Make-A-Thon organizer Kristina Lustig used the term &#8220;anti-goal&#8221; to describe the overall sentiment towards shipping anything after the end of the week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to avoid giving people at the company or anyone in our community the sense that we&#8217;d only focus on these products during a Make-A-Thon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We were really intentional about not turning it into a &#8216;Wild West&#8217; product development sprint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this was Stack Overflow&#8217;s first attempt at a hackathon, Lustig told us that there were two primary goals for the event. &#8220;The hope was to learn where the issues were and see how we might work them out for the next one,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;but we were also excited to give people at the company the chance to tackle the power user experience on Stack Overflow, which they had been eager to do for quite a while.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Accomplishments Already Affecting the Stack Overflow Experience</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 13 Make-A-Thon teams with names like The Ergonomic Toadstools and The Hot Dogs. Each team presented on a wide variety of projects on January 11th, ranging from overdue bug fixes to site-wide improvements for power users such as responsive review queues. Aaron Shekey, Design Systems Lead at Stack Overflow, said that he was pleasantly surprised by how much the teams were able to accomplish during the Make-A-Thon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had some healthy skepticism at the beginning of that week but was shocked at how many quick wins we had,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;We were able to test our design system, delete a lot of old CSS, and ship some better moderator experiences all within a week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another team worked on code fences, which allow developers to render something as code on Stack Overflow using backticks or tildes. We’ve received many requests from our community over the years to make our code syntax more consistent with other sites, many of which use </span><a href="https://commonmark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommonMark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When the team shipped code fences at the end of the week, it was widely celebrated by the community.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9695" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/code_fences.png" alt="code_fences" width="1234" height="1068" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/code_fences.png 1234w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/code_fences-300x260.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/code_fences-768x665.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/code_fences-780x675.png 780w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/code_fences-260x225.png 260w " sizes="(max-width: 1234px) 100vw, 1234px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the Make-A-Thon turned out to be a revelation for other participants. &#8220;There were parts of the site that I had never heard of,&#8221; Lustig said. &#8220;For example,  I had no idea how complicated translation and localization were on our sites until I saw improvements during the demos.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Lots of Learning to Drive Our Next Make-A-Thon</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone involved with our first Make-A-Thon felt that it was a success, but Lustig tells us that the issues she hoped to discover were abundantly clear by the end of the week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think people needed more advance notice about the Make-A-Thon,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;It was difficult for people like product managers to participate because they couldn’t spend a week away from upcoming releases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lustig also says that she hopes for increased participation from non-technical employees that work on the product. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure there are projects that involve no code at all, that people just haven&#8217;t had the chance to think about,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be even more outspoken in the future about how the Make-A-Thon is a great opportunity to work on those things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to participate in future Make-A-Thons? We&#8217;re hiring for roles across the company! </span></i><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can check out our open positions and apply here</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>For nine years, we at Stack Overflow have fielded a survey, asking people who code about their opinions on a variety of topics, from whether they prefer a dark or light theme in their IDE to how their challenges change with experience. This is a huge project for us each year, with contributions in 2019 from product managers, our UX researcher, designers, community managers, web developers, marketers, and me, Stack Overflow’s data scientist. We learn so much each year from our Developer Survey, both from the results and the process of fielding it; right now, we have a massive Google Doc of things to do better! One lesson that stands out is how important careful preparation is. Looking back at past years, we haven’t always been as successful at this as we’d like, but we’re proud of our progress on some challenging issues including survey design, data analysis reproducibility, and using language that connects with a broader population of developers.</p>
<p>There were three main folks involved in the planning of the actual survey questions and how you as a respondent engage with them. The first is Anita Taylor, a product manager here at Stack Overflow who is leading the 2019 Developer Survey. “We try to incorporate as much feedback as we can from two audiences, the external developer community and internal Stack Overflow stakeholders,” Anita says. “Internally, we get input on proposed questions from dozens of Stack Overflow employees and then ask our engineers to take the survey and give us feedback. On the developer side, we did three things: reviewed direct feedback from last year’s survey, took suggestions for new questions, and got input from 1,600 developers who took a test version of the survey.”</p>
<p>Anita also is responsible for managing the technical details of how respondents interact with our survey. We experienced a few hiccups in this area because of the third-party survey platform we use, such as geographical challenges and ad-blocker issues, and we are exploring options for future surveys.</p>
<p>The second main person involved in planning the Developer Survey this year is Beth Devine, Stack Overflow’s UX researcher. Beth’s deep user research experience has contributed to some significant improvements in question and survey design this year. “I was lucky to come on board with a great survey from 2018 to work from, but one of our biggest priorities this year was trimming the survey length,” says Beth. “Last year people overwhelmingly said it was too long.” It turns out this was harder than those of us planning the survey expected! “It’s a delicate balance between respecting that feedback and trying to make room for all the questions we’d like to ask,” Beth shares. “One solution was to identify questions and topics that had very consistent responses over the past few years. We realized that we weren’t learning a lot of new information, and that asking them every other year might be a better use of space. It still allows us to track trends in the data over time.” Last years’ median time to finish clocked in at almost 30 minutes. We successfully shortened it this year, without sacrificing too much, and as of today, this year’s respondents are finishing with a median time of 23 minutes.</p>
<p>The third main person involved in planning the 2019 survey is me, Stack Overflow’s data scientist. I worked with Beth in detail on question writing, so that our expectations for data analysis were aligned. I also used data from last year’s survey and trends in tags on our site (such as those visualized in our Trends tool) to choose which technologies to include on the survey. We wanted to include the most popular and fastest growing technologies without overwhelming the respondent with an extremely onerous list to scroll through. I used the write-in options from last year to check out technologies we may have missed, and we carefully considered which smaller or shrinking technologies we would be comfortable leaving off this year. If we cut one of your favorite technologies, a) I’m really sorry and b) please do write it in the text box!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow and InfoJobs are partnering to bring more job opportunities to the developer community in Spain. Since we launched Stack Overflow Jobs in 2009, its mission has been to connect developers to the right job opportunities. We do this by focusing on the developer experience, empowering job searchers with criteria tailored to technical roles, and leveraging our analytics to match developers to jobs based on criteria such as location and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But occasionally, developers around the world don’t see enough jobs tailored to them. That’s why we’re so excited to be partnering with InfoJobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">InfoJobs is the largest job board in Spain and has been helping people in Spain find jobs for over 20 years. Our partnership leverages InfoJob’s robust connections to employers to help match Spanish developers to new opportunities from the 900,000 visitors on our site each month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how the partnership works: technical jobs posted on InfoJobs will also be found on Stack Overflow Jobs so long as they meet Stack Overflow’s job quality standards (e.g. a job posting must list the hiring company, in order to uphold our commitment to developers and ensure high quality jobs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Stack Overflow continues to grow, we’re working hard to help connect more developers to the right jobs in Europe and beyond. See </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?l=Spain?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_medium=so-blog&amp;utm_campaign=infojobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current openings in Spain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on our website.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What languages do you want to work with next year? Are you more productive in an office or working from home? When did you write your first line of code? We want to hear from you in our <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/dev-survey/start?utm_medium=so-blog&amp;utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_campaign=dev-survey-2019">annual developer survey</a>! The survey, now in its ninth year, launches today and anyone who codes is encouraged to participate. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/dev-survey/start?utm_medium=so-blog&amp;utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_campaign=dev-survey-2019">Take the 2019 survey!</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s survey questions are designed to gain insight into developer career paths, programming languages and tools, working preferences, and overall opinions and feedback. There are some fun questions, too (like previous years’ </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tabs vs. spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#work-how-do-you-pronounce-gif"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gif vs. “jiff”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We heard you loud and clear last year when you asked for a shorter survey. We did our best to deliver without sacrificing valuable insight, and we shaved off about five minutes from last year’s survey. The survey should take about 25 minutes to complete. Survey results are used by Stack Overflow, as well as our community, and are picked up by media outlets around the world. Accordingly, we want to make sure we’re putting our best foot forward. If you have feedback as you take the survey or once you complete it, </span><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’d love to hear it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping with tradition, anonymized survey results will be available publicly under the Open Database License. You’ll be able to download and analyze the dataset later this year, just like we explored last year&#8217;s data in our interactive widget below to glean user feedback.</span></p>
<p><strong>If you use security or ad-blocking plugins, you may see error messages<br />
</strong>Our third-party software provider, Qualtrics, does not work well with certain ad blockers and security software. To avoid error messages that prevent you from taking the survey, please try specifically unblocking Qualtrics in your plugin or pausing the plugin while you take the survey.</p>
<h2>What do users say about Stack Overflow?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a>, we asked users what the best, worst, most exciting, and most annoying things about Stack Overflow are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are their answers.</span></p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 740px; border: none;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/stack-survey-2018-graphic.html"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain survey answers are treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore excluded from the anonymized results. These questions are highlighted in the survey with a note saying, “This information will be kept private.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey is expected to close on February 12th. If you’re a registered user who completes the survey in its entirety, you have the option to get the Census badge on Stack Overflow or a different technical site in the Stack Exchange network. (If you’re not yet a registered user, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/signup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sign up here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks in advance for your time and thoughtfulness!</span></p>

Then at some point it became </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2012/01/16/state-of-the-stack-2011-a-message-from-your-ceo-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an infographic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was… listen, everyone was doing infographics in 2011. Now it’s 2019, the company has grown and changed in so many ways, so we’re bringing this tradition back and taking a look at how far we’ve come while being open and honest about how much work we have left to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 was a big year! Some stats:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across all of </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Exchange network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we saw </span><b>9+ billion pageviews</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from </span><b>100+ million users</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the course of the year. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow alone had over</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2.5 million answers and 2 million new questions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with over 1.6 million new users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joining the community. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our community members and volunteer moderators handled almost 2 million flags, to keep abusive, unwelcoming, and inappropriate content off the site, and apply our updated </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/conduct"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 40,000 jobs were posted on </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We now have over 900,000 searchable profiles of developers who are interested in being contacted about a job on </span><a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/talent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we launched </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new way for developers to use the power of Stack Overflow Q&amp;A inside their organization. Thousands of organizations are already using it to help their teams share knowledge and ship faster.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this matters because Stack Overflow exists to <b>help everyone who codes</b><b> learn and share their knowledge</b>. Every time someone finds a solution to a problem, learns something new, or finds an opportunity to grow their career on Stack Overflow, we’re all advancing that mission together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also know that we still have a lot of work to do. Stack Overflow helps a lot of people today, but it is not yet the the welcoming, inclusive, and diverse platform we want it to be. That&#8217;s something we are committed to continuing to improve on this year, but we can&#8217;t do it without your help!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Update: Welcoming everyone who codes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow has never been about the company, or about any one use</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">r. It’s about bringing all the world’s developers together to learn from one another, and together creating shared artifacts that help millions of people all over the world. It’s about creating a community where everyone who codes — regardless of how they identify, where they work, or where they wen</span>t to school — can participate and feel welcome.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9645" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Code-of-Conduct-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Code-of-Conduct-300x143.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Code-of-Conduct-400x191.png 400w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Code-of-Conduct.png 512w " sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, good intentions aren’t good enough and we’ve fallen short of that ideal in a lot of ways: too often people feel unwelcome, unheard, and unable to help or to find help, particularly women, people of color, and other underrepresented groups. </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has to change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it starts with us, the company, providing the tools and support that you need to help one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, we launched what we call the “Welcome Wagon”, an effort to identify and improve areas where we can do better. This is a collaborative effort, with our developers, user researchers, data scientists, and community managers reaching out to community members, moderators, and voices from outside the community to work together on solutions.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9646" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/New-Contributer-300x155.png" alt="" width="300" height="155" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/New-Contributer-300x155.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/New-Contributer-400x206.png 400w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/New-Contributer.png 434w " sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve made a lot of progress in half a year. We </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/08/07/get-to-know-our-new-code-of-conduct/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rolled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/conduct"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and added </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/313754/updated-comment-flagging-supporting-the-new-code-of-conduct"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new flags on comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to identify both abusive and unkind comments. We added a </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314287/come-take-a-look-at-our-new-contributor-indicator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New Contributor” indicator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to encourage people to be helpful and friendly to new users, and we’re testing a </span><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/378057/the-ask-question-wizard-is-now-in-testing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Ask Question wizard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help guide users through asking their first question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we’re still just scratching the surface. One thing we’ve heard loud and clear from the community is that we need to also address a lot of existing bugs and community debt. These issues have accumulated over the years to lead to confusing and frustrating experiences for all of our users, and we haven’t been doing enough to prioritize fixing them.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9647" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Status-Completed--300x106.png" alt="" width="300" height="106" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Status-Completed--300x106.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Status-Completed--400x141.png 400w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Status-Completed-.png 498w " sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2019 we’re going to be redoubling our efforts on this, adding more devs, designers, PMs, and community managers internally (in fact, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re hiring right now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) They’ll be split across two major initiatives: continuing the Welcome Wagon work of making Stack Overflow more welcoming and inclusive, and a newly focused effort on community improvements and expert user experience.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Update: How does Stack Overflow make money again?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow has three main business lines:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our newest product, brings the power of Stack Overflow Q&amp;A to organizations in a private, secure space just for internal teams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/engagement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products help companies reach and engage the developer community with on-topic, relevant ads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/talent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps organizations reach, attract, and hire the right technical talent for their team.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest expansion in our business this year by far was on Teams and Enterprise. The product idea is simple: give organizations a private version of Stack Overflow Q&amp;A just for their team. While Stack Overflow public Q&amp;A has been enormously successful at helping programmers share knowledge and find quick solutions to their problems, it can only ever solve a fraction of the problems professional programmers face because most programmers work on private code they can’t ask about in public. Every software team struggles with documentation and knowledge sharing, and Stack Overflow is designed to enable developers to write reusable snippets of documentation for one another in a way that doesn’t feel like a chore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It probably shouldn’t be a surprise that so many </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/customers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are finding that Stack Overflow helps their team onboard more quickly, reduce knowledge silos, and ship code faster. </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/customers#Teams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of organizations are already using Stack Overflow for Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and raving about it, and Stack Overflow for Enterprise is seeing success in </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/customers#enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune 500 companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that range from major technology companies to the world’s largest financial service firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the explosive growth of Teams and Enterprise, and the continuing value of Talent and Advertising, 2018 added up to the best financial year in Stack Overflow’s 10-year history. While we’re not quite </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrooge_McDuck#Wealth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">swimming in pools of cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet, we’ve never been on better footing heading into a new year of growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company Update: Who are all these people?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the work has grown, so has the company. We now have employees in 14 different countries, working either in our offices in New York, London, Munich, and Denver, or remotely from wherever they happen to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been working hard to create a more diverse team and inclusive team internally. We’re taking a look at our policies, benefits, interview practices, and internal trainings to make sure that we’re supporting the team we have. We’re also working hard to recruit a more diverse team. Globally, the number of people working at Stack Overflow who identify as women, non-binary, or transgender is now 39% (including 42% in management and leadership, and 32% in technical roles), and 15% of US employees are from an under-represented racial or ethnic group (10% in management and leadership, and 9% in technical roles). While this isn’t where we want to be, it represents substantial growth over the past few years. In 2018, we also concluded a third-party compensation review to address any gender or racial pay gaps, and implemented a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rooney Rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for tech and leadership hiring to ensure we continue to address the gaps in our hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We rolled out some new employee-friendly policy updates, too. For employees who have been here for more than two years, we have an extended stock option exercise window so that employees aren’t forced to exercise their options 90 days after leaving (and often pay hefty taxes) or lose them forever. We also extended our fully-paid parental leave to 16 weeks for primary caregivers and 12 weeks for secondary caregivers, and removed pro-rating in your first year (so everyone gets the full amount regardless of how recently they joined).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, 13 people in the company took advantage of our sabbatical policy to take an extended break to travel the world, </span><a href="https://kevinmontrose.com/2018/11/09/sabbatical-log-november-1st/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work on a side project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, learn a new instrument, or just spend time with their family. We’re very proud of our sabbatical policy, which lets any employee who has been here for five years take an extra four weeks of paid time off to rest, recharge, and spend time on things they care about. I think it’s one of the reasons why so many of our earliest employees are still with the company.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Involved: Help us build the future of Stack Overflow!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 was a big year for Stack Overflow, and I’m excited for what 2019 holds. Developers are shaping the future of the world, and we have a responsibility to help push that future in the direction of more openness, diversity, collaboration, and empathy. If we can do the hard work to make Stack Overflow a place where everyone who codes feels welcome and able to contribute, extend that to every company through Stack Overflow for Teams and Enterprise and Stack Overflow Talent, we can change the world for the better. And the best part is that anyone can join in and be a part of this mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve never </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/signup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined the community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or tried asking or answering your first question, there’s no better day than today! The community works because regular, every day programmers like you decided one day to give something back and help someone out. By treating people with </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/conduct"><span style="font-weight: 400;">empathy and respect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll help us create a more welcoming and inclusive community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company thinks knowledge sharing is a priority, give </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a try — it’s free for the first 14 days and starts at just $10 per month (flat!) for your first 10 users. Or if you’re looking to hire developers, or reach our massive global audience of developers, try </span><a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/talent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/engagement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you’re looking for a new challenge yourself, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re hiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and not just developers: it takes a team to make all this happen, so we’re looking to grow everything from Sales and Customer Success to IT, Marketing, Product, Design, Finance, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here#positions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, if you’re already a member of the community, </span><b>THANK YOU</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all you do to help others. We still have a lot of work to do to make Stack Overflow the welcoming, inclusive, and diverse community we want it to be, and we can’t do it without you! So if you have ideas, suggestions, or ways we can help you in 2019, please</span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">let us know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2018 Winter Bash festivities have come to an end. It was a fun season, especially with the addition of the sweater mini-game. As is our custom, we&#8217;ll recap a bit here on some of the stats for the hats as well as post some of the many outrageously attractive avatars we found across the network.</p>
<p>This year we saw a 5-way tie for most hats earned during Winter Bash! However, the question still remains&#8230; did they earn <em>all of the possible</em> hats? Congratulations to these winners!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9595" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-Leaderboard-Winners-1089x675.png" alt="" width="1024" height="635" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-Leaderboard-Winners-1089x675.png 1089w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-Leaderboard-Winners-300x186.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-Leaderboard-Winners-768x476.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-Leaderboard-Winners-363x225.png 363w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>This year also featured a few secret hats which were awarded multiple times.  Many of you were able to find them and wear them. The top 2 hats that were awarded were the Still Fresh hat (awarded to over 203K people) and the Retro Fan hat (awarded over 170K times). The first hat to be awarded during Winter Bash was the Still Fresh hat which many of you received. Next was the Retro Fan hat which was awarded to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1074998/%E6%9E%97%E6%9E%9C%E7%9A%9E">林果皞</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1366937/perdi-estaquel">Perdi Estaquel</a>, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1702731/artur-czyzewski">Artur Czyżewski</a> at the same time as soon as Winter Bash launched!  Third was the Identification Division hat which <a href="https://russian.stackexchange.com/users/967/matthewmartin">MatthewMartin</a> won 2 seconds after Winter Bash began.</p>
<p>The hat that was least awarded was the Red Baron hat &#8211; only 13 people earned it so if you won it, congratulations!</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;d like to share some of the hats that we found across the network that brought a smile to our faces.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2009, Stack Overflow’s three employees (or associates, as they were then called) were inspired to end the year by </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/01/01/stack-overflow-gives-back/"><span style="font-weight: 400">giving back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. To recognize our amazing community of moderators, we made small contributions to six nonprofits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, we’ve donated over </span><span style="font-weight: 400">$350,000</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">through what we’ve dubbed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Stack Overflow Gives Back</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. This year, we’re celebrating the initiative’s 10th anniversary (along with </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/anniversary"><span style="font-weight: 400">the 10th anniversary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of our company!).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This month our 577 incredible community moderators selected from five charities to which we will donate $100 on their behalf (that’s $57,000!). Our sites literally couldn’t succeed without these incredible volunteers, so we’re proud to be able to give a little back to some wonderful causes in thanks for all their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, we’re celebrating each of the organizations and highlighting how these contributions may impact each one:  </span></p>
<h2><b>Crisis Text Line &#8211; $7,700 donation </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A series of high-profile and heartbreaking deaths this year brought much-needed attention to mental health issues. We recognize that there’s a lot of stigma around talking about mental illness, and that’s why we’re happy to support a nonprofit that’s leveraging technology to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://crisistextline.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">Crisis Text Line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> provides free, 24/7 confidential support for those in crisis, whether it’s depression, anxiety, eating disorders, bullying, or suicidal thoughts. Crisis Text Line acts as a simple support resource, while using data to make us better and to improve communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our donation to the organization this year will support about one month of the technology required to keep the platform up and running.</span></p>
<h2><b>Doctors Without Borders &#8211; $19,000 donation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our community of moderators is incredibly global, and Stack Overflow is used by people all over the world. </span><a href="http://doctorswithoutborders.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">Doctors Without Borders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is one of the world’s most robust efforts to provide medical aid where it’s needed most. The nonprofit has reach into more than 70 countries around the world. They do everything from providing emergency response and access to healthcare to advocating for medical care and research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doctors Without Borders impacts everything from Ebola outbreaks and the ongoing HIV/AIDS crisis, to the malnutrition that affects over 20 million children. Few organizations are able to tackle so many issues and touch so many people as Doctors Without Borders.</span></p>
<h2><b>Electronic Frontier Foundation &#8211; $12,800 donation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of legislation was passed in 2018 all over the world, and not all of it was great for a free and open internet. Fortunately, organizations like </span><a href="http://eff.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Electronic Frontier Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (EFF) are monitoring legislation and court cases in order to fight the good fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">EFF is the leading nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation. They champion these things through impact litigation, policy analysis, grassroots activism and technology development. The foundation works to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our technology grows.</span></p>
<h2><b>Pursuit  &#8211; $6,800 donation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over </span><a href="https://medium.com/@jayhanlon/welcome-wagon-dd57cbdd54d9"><span style="font-weight: 400">the past year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, Stack Overflow has </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/12/04/welcome-wagon-community-and-comments-on-stack-overflow/"><span style="font-weight: 400">taken big steps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to make the site more welcoming and inclusive. This is why we’re especially excited about </span><a href="http://pursuit.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pursuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a non-profit that welcomes 200+ people into coding and tech every year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pursuit partners with tech companies to create new pathways for high-need, high-potential employees by training their blue-collar and non-traditional workers to become software engineers. Over a four-year Fellowship, Fellows spend 10 or 12 months in intensive training, followed by three years of one-on-one career support. The Fellowship’s Graduates’ average annual salaries have quadrupled, going from about $18,000 a year to $85,000. </span></p>
<h2><b>Sea Legacy &#8211; $11,400 donation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Intellectual curiosity drives many of our contributors. There are a number of excellent nonprofits working to combat climate change and save our planet, and Sea Legacy is doing just that by relying on people’s intellectual curiosity to catalyze change. The nonprofit works to create healthy and abundant oceans by producing powerful media and art that gives people hope.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sealegacy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sea Legacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a collective of some of the most experienced and renowned photographers, filmmakers, and storytellers, working together on behalf of our oceans. Their important and ambitious work is on display in their popular </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sealegacy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. And their Instagram is a key part of their bold goal: to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">engage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> one billion people in ocean conservation. They’ve already </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">reached</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> a potential audience of 1.8 billion people, which is the advertising equivalent of $16.8 million.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we’re super excited to be giving back to these impactful nonprofits, it’s also important that we recognize the tools and organizations that help our Engineering and IT teams do their jobs everyday. This year, we donated </span>$1,000<span style="font-weight: 400"> to each of the following organizations <a href="https://powershell.org/summit/summit-onramp/">Powershell Summit OnRamp</a>; <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL Foundation</a>; <a href="https://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a>; <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a>; <a href="https://fogproject.org/">Free Open Ghost</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are thrilled to be supporting so many important and impactful organizations, but more than anything we’re feeling very grateful for our moderators and our community. They contribute so much to Stack Overflow, which contributes so much to the world. We (Stack Overflow’s now more than three employees, who are no longer called associates) are humbled to be giving a little something back on their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cheers to an incredible 2018 and an exciting New Year!</span></p>

<p>This year we are attempting to <em>knit</em> our users together in our love for hats for the 7th year in a row.  And this year, we&#8217;ve even added a way for you to get creative without wasting any real yarn.  Starting now (December 12, 2018) and going through to January 1, 2019 we are officially in <a href="https://winterbash2018.stackexchange.com/">Winter Bash season</a>! The way to earn these special hats is by <a href="https://winterbash2018.stackexchange.com/">completing challenges</a> on participating sites.  These challenges will give you the opportunity to unlock hats that you can place on your avatar and wear around the network.  This year, we&#8217;ve made some modifications to our hat selection and have even added <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/304500/a-moose-some-silly-putty-and-a-desperate-plea-for-help">some of your suggestions</a>!  Some of the triggers for the hats have also been refreshed&#8230;.and yes, there are some hats that you&#8217;ll want to discover on your own.</p>
<p>Once you complete a challenge, you&#8217;ll notice that an icon of a hat will appear in your profile:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9574 aligncenter" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Icon.png" alt="" width="407" height="252" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Icon.png 407w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Icon-300x186.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Icon-363x225.png 363w " sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></p>
<p>Click the hat and you&#8217;ll be taken to your hat box:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9575 aligncenter" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Rack.png" alt="" width="794" height="575" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Rack.png 794w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Rack-300x217.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Rack-768x556.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hat-Rack-311x225.png 311w " sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p>Pick a hat you&#8217;ve earned and use the tools to resize and rotate as needed to fit your avatar:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9576 aligncenter" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Resize-Tools.png" alt="" width="505" height="312" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Resize-Tools.png 505w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Resize-Tools-300x185.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Resize-Tools-364x225.png 364w " sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Now you can go and show off your collection of hats.  Why not wear one every day for a week? It&#8217;s up to you &#8211; if you earn it, you can wear it. However, be aware that on January 2 all hats will be taken back to storage where we&#8217;ll spend the rest of the year cleaning and repairing the ones that tore or got dirty.</p>
<p>We wish you lots of luck and enjoyment as you join us once again for our annual tradition!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past summer, we wrote our <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/07/10/welcome-wagon-classifying-comments-on-stack-overflow/">first blog post about comments on Stack Overflow</a>, focusing on our initial work rating comments internally at Stack Overflow and what we learned. Since then, we&#8217;ve fielded this comment rating task more broadly in our community. This blog post shares some of what we are learning.</p>
<h2>Engaging our community</h2>
<p>I (Jason) wrote a web application that presents a user with a comment thread from a post on Stack Overflow and asks the user to rate each comment in the thread as fine, unwelcoming, or abusive. Our <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/07/10/welcome-wagon-classifying-comments-on-stack-overflow/">first blog post</a> shared results from when we asked employees at Stack Overflow, including developers, product managers, and executives, to rate comments. In August, we rolled out our new <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/08/07/get-to-know-our-new-code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, along with new flags for comments that align with these categories, one flag for rude/abusive and one flag for unfriendly/unkind. This fall, we extended our comment classification task beyond our employees to our larger community. We invited individuals from three groups to rate comments.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/site-moderators">Moderators</a> on Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites</li>
<li>Individuals who responded to <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/">our blog post in April</a>, indicating they want to help make Stack Overflow more welcoming</li>
<li>A sample of registered users from our general research list (you can opt in/out of our research list in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/email/settings/current">your Stack Overflow email settings</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>To log in to this web app and record data, each user needed a Stack Overflow account, so users had to make an account if they didn&#8217;t have one already. We asked participants to invest at least one hour in rating comments, and to not work for more than 20 minutes at one sitting.</p>
<p>What kind of response did we get? Overall, there were 525 users who spent at least 15 minutes or more rating comments. They made 253,807 ratings of 40,358 distinct comments. How many users and comment ratings did we have, for each kind of user?</p>
<p>
<table id="tablepress-4" class="tablepress tablepress-id-4">

<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<th class="column-1">Type</th><th class="column-2">Users</th><th class="column-3">Comment Ratings</th>

<p>The moderators demonstrated their enormous commitment to our community through this project, as they do consistently day in, day out; moderators who participated in this project rated an average of over 1,000 comments each. Folks who responded to our blog post expressing interest in welcome/inclusion on Stack Overflow also invested a great deal of time, rating over 500 comments each.</p>
<p>We see can see this visually by looking at the <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/52400/what-is-cdf-cumulative-distribution-function/52416">cumulative distribution functions</a> for each kind of user; this kind of plot shows, for each number of comment ratings, the percentage of users who rated that many comments or lower.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9535" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cdf-1-945x675.png" alt="" width="945" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cdf-1-945x675.png 945w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cdf-1-300x214.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cdf-1-768x549.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cdf-1-315x225.png 315w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cdf-1-630x450.png 630w " sizes="(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not used to interpreting this kind of graph, take a look at <code>x = 1000</code>, the location on the x-axis that corresponds to 1,000 comments. The line for the moderators is the lowest, indicating that more moderators submitted more comment ratings compared to the other groups.</p>
<h2>Group differences</h2>
<p>Different kinds of people experience Stack Overflow in different ways. If we look at all the ratings made by the different types of users aggregated, how do the different kinds of groups perceive these comments on Stack Overflow?</p>
<p>
<table id="tablepress-5" class="tablepress tablepress-id-5">
<thead>
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<th class="column-1">Type</th><th class="column-2">Fine</th><th class="column-3">Unwelcoming</th><th class="column-4">Abusive</th>

</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-5 from cache --></p>
<p>The highest rates of unwelcoming comments were identified by the internal employees at Stack Overflow, followed by Stack Exchange moderators. We <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/">trust and support our moderators</a>, and in this specific project, moderators demonstrated their understanding of unfriendly and unwelcoming behavior in comments.</p>
<p>Regular registered users from our research list perceived the next lowest rate of unfriendly comments, and users who responded to our blog post about <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/">making Stack Overflow more welcoming</a> found the lowest rates of unfriendly comments of all. How can we interpret this? We specifically invited users who may not consider themselves active participants in our community in order to gain outside perspective, but then these users saw the lowest rates of unwelcoming behavior.</p>
<p>A possible explanation is that we are seeing a real effect of deep experience with our site; it appears the more invested an individual is here at Stack Overflow, the more sensitive they are to problematic behavior. What do these unfriendly comments look like? The following combine elements of real comments to show typical examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<em>Why</em> do you want to do this? You have conflated at least three problems here.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;It will be very hard to help you with such a trivial bug. It could come from any line in your code, and we have to guess.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;How exactly is this going to solve my problem?!&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand how to use this site. Here nobody codes for you; read the docs and then show us.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What are you <em>actually</em> trying to achieve? Please learn how to use a debugger.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Our project showed that the more deeply an individual is connected to Stack Overflow (as an employee, or a moderator), the more they are likely to see problems in comments like these. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This effect is robust to comparing groups who were shown the same comments, who rated the same number of comments, and other analytical approaches.</span></p>
<h2>Individual differences</h2>
<p>What do the distributions of ratings for each individual look like?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9532" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rating_boxplot-1-1200x508.png" alt="" width="1024" height="433" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rating_boxplot-1-1200x508.png 1200w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rating_boxplot-1-300x127.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rating_boxplot-1-768x325.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rating_boxplot-1-400x169.png 400w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Each individual did not rate the same set of comments and worked for different lengths of time, so we expect variability in the results for each individual. Overall, the median percentage of perceived unwelcoming comments per individual was 3.5%, quite a bit lower than the <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/07/10/welcome-wagon-classifying-comments-on-stack-overflow/">median percentage for employees</a> of 6.5%.</p>
<p>To understand how much agreement there is between raters, we can again look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha">Krippendorff&#8217;s alpha</a>, a measure that ranges from zero (nobody agrees) to one (perfect agreement). This measure accounts for the number of raters, so we can compare agreement among employees to the groups with more raters. What is Krippendorff&#8217;s alpha, for comments that were rated by at least three people?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9534" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kripp_alpha-1-900x675.png" alt="" width="900" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kripp_alpha-1-900x675.png 900w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kripp_alpha-1-300x225.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kripp_alpha-1-768x576.png 768w " sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>These values for alpha are low compared to what social scientists would use to draw reliable conclusions based on the ratings; social scientists look for values close to 0.8 or more. Notice that Stack Overflow employees rated more comments as unwelcoming than other groups but agreed with each other about what is unwelcoming and abusive at higher rates at the same time. The rate of agreement among moderators and registered users was lowest (although still <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/33566/is-joel-spolskys-hunting-of-the-snark-post-valid-statistical-content-analysis">much higher than for people unfamiliar with Stack Overflow</a>), and the rate of agreement for the users who volunteered to help make Stack Overflow more welcoming was a bit higher. Remember that these were the users who rated the <em>lowest</em> overall levels of unfriendliness; some spot-checking indicates these users identified only the clearest examples of problematic text.</p>
<p>Another factor that impacts interactions on Stack Overflow is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a>. Do we see any difference in how raters perceived unwelcoming behavior with their own reputation? This can help us understand if &#8220;power users&#8221; (distinguished from moderators) may be driving problems with site culture.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9533" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/reputation-1-1080x675.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/reputation-1-1080x675.png 1080w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/reputation-1-300x188.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/reputation-1-768x480.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/reputation-1-360x225.png 360w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There is no clear evidence in this plot for a relationship, indicating that high-reputation users perceive unfriendly behavior at about the same rate as low-reputation users. We have seen effects similar to this before, for example, in our annual Developer Survey. When asked what the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#community-developers-perspectives-about-our-community">worst or most annoying thing about Stack Overflow is</a>, developers of all experience levels and self-reported activity levels on Stack Overflow mentioned issues with harsh interactions and site culture.</p>
<p>All together, this begins to paint a complex and interesting picture of who understands unwelcoming behavior and in what ways. Moderators and high-reputation users are just as likely, or even more likely, to identify unwelcoming comments compared to new users. Stack Overflow employees identify more comments as problematic and agree with each other more about what is a problem compared to the other kinds of users in this project.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>So where do we go from here? For starters, we as employees learned that we don&#8217;t always perceive problems in the same way as other members of our community. We will keep this in mind as we move forward with plans to make Stack Overflow a better place for developers to learn and share knowledge.</p>
<p>We plan to use this dataset to investigate how comments are used on questions and answers, toward users of different experience levels, in different communities, and more. Look for more blog posts on these issues in upcoming months. We will continue to use the results from this project in product changes on Stack Overflow, as well as directly using appropriate subsets of this data in machine learning models. Also, in 2019 we will release this dataset (comment IDs, comment ratings, and anonymized/randomized rater ID) upon request so that other people in our community and beyond can explore this data for themselves.</p>
<p>All of this would not be possible without the investment of time and energy of the individuals who participated in this project, and we want to acknowledge each of you who volunteered to help us understand this aspect of our site better. Thank you, for your care and time. Community is central to our identity at Stack Overflow, and we are committed to making Stack Overflow a healthy, inclusive place for developers to learn and share knowledge.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s been an exciting 2018 for Stack Overflow. In late spring, we launched our <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/06/21/rolling-out-the-welcome-wagon-june-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/06/21/rolling-out-the-welcome-wagon-june-update/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539429618006000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENhTGr5yKaUHsLgzl75_7Mn3b6_A">Welcome Wagon</a> initiative to make the network more welcoming. In May, we shipped <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stackoverflow.com/teams&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539429618006000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpI8IQdhRdopvX1wUB0KrMMRViEw">Stack Overflow for Teams</a> and made our knowledge-sharing platform accessible to teams of any size. And September marked our <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stackoverflow.com/anniversary&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539429618006000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLhwm_6GYn1PVfe8Rr0K4gqqnSKQ">10th anniversary</a>, which celebrated the 25 million answers to 16 million questions that have been viewed 12.3 billion times by developers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve grown the ways that we serve developers, and we’re growing our Executive team to support these initiatives as well our ever-expanding community. The team has two new members, and one of our long-time executives has a new role.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our CTO, David Fullerton, was promoted today to President and CTO. This promotion recognizes David’s hard work and contributions over eight years (!) at Stack Overflow. David worked his way up through the ranks here. He started at Fog Creek as an intern; he spent years as a developer and then as a team lead at Stack Overflow before becoming CTO. He’s accomplished a lot and through it all, he’s demonstrated incredible servant leadership — a value that guides everyone at Stack Overflow. He’s the best person to help our company grow and evolve while remaining rooted in our mission to serve all the world’s developers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also have a new VP of Engineering, Mary Ferguson. With David in his new role, our Engineering team is in great hands under her leadership. Mary joined Stack Overflow at the end of September after spending over three years at Etsy, most recently as their VP of Engineering. She’s also had senior technology roles at Amplify Learning and Katzenbach Partners. Her career has been distinguished by the common goal of organizing engineering teams to keep them happy, healthy, and diverse. This is in exact alignment with Stack Overflow’s values embracing servant leadership and growing an inclusive and diverse organization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last but not least, I joined the company in June. Hi! I’m Khalid El Khatib, Stack Overflow’s VP of Marketing and Communications. I’m responsible for our marketing and advertising initiatives and for communicating company announcements externally and internally (like this one).</p>
<p dir="ltr">I came to Stack Overflow from a company called GLG. Before that I worked at Teach For America and at an advertising agency. In addition to my day jobs, I’ve long contributed to publications like <em>PAPER</em>, <em>VICE</em>, and <em>OUT</em> on art, culture, and LGBTQ issues. The common thread through my career is that everything successful I’ve worked on (website redesigns, app launches, even articles that have gone viral) was in large part thanks to brilliant engineers. I’m thrilled to be working alongside so many today and to help amplify their voices here. More than anything, I’m excited to be a part of what Stack Overflow is doing &#8212; helping developers write the script of the future. It’s a bonus to have fantastic colleagues like David and Mary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The three of us are deeply committed to growing Stack Overflow in a way that’s consistent with our mission and values and to making sure our community is at the heart of everything we do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, congratulations to David! Welcome, Mary! And more from me soon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago, a lot was happening. Barack Obama and John McCain were running for U.S. president. Lehman Brothers’ collapse triggered a global financial crisis. The second iPhone came out &#8211; with 3G speeds, y’all! Tweens everywhere were deciding if they were on Team Jacob or Team Edward. Kanye West convinced everyone that what sunglasses had been lacking were </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/kanye-wests-monster-fashion-13880/shades-of-the-future-60784/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">venetian blinds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on September 15, 2008, Stack Overflow’s </span><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public beta went live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9480" style="width: 437px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9480" class="wp-image-9480 size-full" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/stack_overflow_beta.png" alt="stack overflow beta" width="427" height="446" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/stack_overflow_beta.png 427w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/stack_overflow_beta-287x300.png 287w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/stack_overflow_beta-215x225.png 215w " sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9480" class="wp-caption-text">Stack Overflow’s home page in 2008</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, 9.3 million users have provided 25 million answers to 16 million questions. Every 5.1 seconds, someone takes time out of their day and posts an answer, to help a complete stranger on the internet. And since 2007, those answers have been found 12.3 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">billion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> times by developers in need. We estimate that’s saved developers roughly 3.1 billion hours.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the big numbers don’t tell the real story. Every one of those times someone finds help is a developer who nails their initial project at their first job. Or a teenager who finishes her first project &#8211; the one that makes her realize she wants to be a developer when she grows up. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stack Overflow’s real impact. That’s how your efforts to help each other &#8211; to share what you know &#8211; have made a genuine difference.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwS1r1mc888" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, to the 9.3 million of you who’ve joined us along the way, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thank you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And to those of you who are new, welcome. We can’t wait to develop the rest of our future together. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM and Stack Overflow are partnering to bring learning and development to the AI community. As of today, the </span><a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Stack Exchange network is sponsored by IBM. The site, featuring “questions about life and challenges in a world where ‘cognitive’ functions can be mimicked in purely digital environment”, is home to over 2,200 questions and 3,200 answers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership aims to expand awareness of the AI industry, encourage innovation within the AI space, and help developers solve complex problems in the field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke with Peter Moskovits, Program Director of Worldwide Developer Advocacy at IBM, on the partnership’s impact on the AI developer community. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Importance of Online Communities to Developers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As one of the world&#8217;s largest open source contributors, IBM has a lot of respect and appreciation for fellow developers”, says Moskovits. “In addition to speaking at conferences, meetups, and running workshops, our developer advocates around the globe spend a lot of time in online communities; first and foremost on Stack Overflow. On the one hand we come to Stack Overflow to help professionals and enthusiasts who use our technologies (products or open source projects) become successful. On the other hand, we come here to learn. This perpetual learning is what makes a developer advocate&#8217;s job so desirable.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9470" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/questions.png" alt="AI site questions" width="800" height="853" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/questions.png 1306w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/questions-281x300.png 281w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/questions-768x819.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/questions-633x675.png 633w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/questions-211x225.png 211w " sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2><b>Benefits of the AI Site</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fostering meaningful conversations in technology communities is critical. The sheer number of AI developers and the scope they cover has reached the critical mass. Having a dedicated forum for us is a major step forward. Such a forum can help developers get answers to high-level ‘strategic’ questions (build vs. fork vs. buy) as well as very specific integration or interoperability issues.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI developers face a number of challenges in their daily workload, including creating training strategies, optimizing computing power, building trust in the system, legal and moral constraints, or simply finding experienced engineers to solve those problems. Moskovits says, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an open discourse with our peers is what makes Stack Overflow [and the subsequent Stack Exchange sites] such a great place to hang out.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, IBM’s flagship business and technology conference, </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/events/think/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is happening on February 12, 2019 in San Francisco. Through hundreds of labs, attendees can take deep dives into AI, cloud, data, security, and other emerging technologies. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we launched the 2018 update to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/salary">Stack Overflow Salary Calculator</a>, a tool that allows developers and employers to find typical salaries for the software industry based on experience level, location, education, and specific technologies.</p>
<p>The methodology we used is similar to <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/19/much-developers-earn-find-stack-overflow-salary-calculator/">last year</a>, but this year we&#8217;ve added support for eight new countries and refined which technologies contribute to our salary predictions. Our salary calculator is based on the comprehensive data from the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a>, and the unprecedented number of responses we had this year has allowed us to build a more accurate model that applies to more developers across the world.</p>
<p>The inputs to our salary calculator, that we find most predictive of a developer&#8217;s salary, are your</p>
<ul>
<li>location,</li>
<li>education,</li>
<li>years of professional coding experience,</li>
<li>what kind of developer you are, and</li>
<li>the technologies you use professionally.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>One of the biggest factors in how much developers are paid is where they live and work. Let&#8217;s look at salaries for the same five countries that we supported in last year&#8217;s version of the salary calculator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9454" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/salary_by_country-1-1080x675.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/salary_by_country-1-1080x675.png 1080w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/salary_by_country-1-300x188.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/salary_by_country-1-768x480.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/salary_by_country-1-360x225.png 360w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Have salaries changed from last year? According to our survey, developers are earning more overall, in all countries, with median salaries that are on average 25% higher than last year in locations such as London and San Francisco. Some of this increase is because we changed <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#methodology">how we handled trimming the highest salaries</a> from our dataset; we decided we were overzealous in trimming high salaries last year. While we are <strong>not</strong> saying that developers all over the world saw raises that big this past year, we do see evidence that developer salaries are increasing in all locations compared to last year.</p>
<p>In addition to these five countries, the comprehensive responses to this year&#8217;s survey have allowed us to build models that cover eight additional new countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>Brazil</li>
<li>India</li>
<li>Netherlands</li>
<li>Poland</li>
<li>Russia</li>
<li>Spain</li>
<li>Sweden</li>
</ul>
<p>Even within any given country, developer salaries can vary from city to city. In the UK, for example, our survey results indicate that developers in London earn over 20% more than developers in the rest of the UK. That being said, our dataset is not able to distinguish between cities that have around the average salary for any given country, to give individual predictions for all cities. To illustrate this, let&#8217;s look at the United States.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9455" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/us_boxplot-1-1080x675.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/us_boxplot-1-1080x675.png 1080w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/us_boxplot-1-300x188.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/us_boxplot-1-768x480.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/us_boxplot-1-360x225.png 360w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>This plot shows the distribution of salaries in USD for the top 10 metro areas in the US by number of respondents. (Notice that the y-axis is on a log scale.) The cities are ordered from the lowest median salary (Minneapolis) to the highest median salary (the San Francisco area). Take a look at this graph and see how close together the median salaries for cities like Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Portland, Boston, and even Austin are. In our modeling, the data we have only supports a statistically different salary for the cities shown in orange. San Francisco, Seattle, and New York have developer salaries that are high enough compared to typical US norms <em>and</em> enough developers working there that we can confidently predict a different salary for a developer living in one of these cities than the US in general. For developers living in cities like Chicago or Boston, salaries are just about the same as what is typical for the US overall, so we can&#8217;t build a confident, separate prediction for each of these cities. You might look at this plot and wonder about cities with salaries that appear slightly lower like Minneapolis, but there we had fewer respondents, so again we can&#8217;t build a confident, separate prediction. In the US, we have individual city-level predictions for San Francisco, Seattle, and New York, and then a country-level prediction that covers the rest of the US. This same pattern holds true in other countries including France, Germany, and Canada, for the same reasons.</p>
<p>On our survey this year, we asked respondents what city they lived in via a free text field. We used standard text mining and data cleaning approaches to deal with this data, and included suburbs within larger metro areas. For example, the San Francisco Bay Area here includes respondents who said they live in San Jose, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Oakland, etc., while Potsdam respondents are included in Berlin, and so forth.</p>
<p>Last year, we asked users to help us improve our salary calculator by confidentially sharing salary information with us in the calculator itself. This salary survey was 100% private and never appeared on any profile on our site or was shared with employers. We tried using this dataset to refine the salary calculator and build a better salary model, but it turned out that data collected in this way was less useful than our annual Developer Survey. The two main reasons were the geographical coverage we had and the number of responses. We want to send our thanks to every user who shared their data with us through the salary calculator; we appreciate your interest and trust. Since we won&#8217;t be using that data, we will stop collecting salary data through our salary calculator and we will delete the data we already have, according to our <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/legal/privacy-policy">data policies</a>.</p>
<h2>Which types of developers make more money?</h2>
<p>Another important factor that affects how much a developer is paid is what kind of work they do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9452" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/devtype-1-844x675.png" alt="" width="844" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/devtype-1-844x675.png 844w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/devtype-1-300x240.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/devtype-1-768x614.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/devtype-1-281x225.png 281w " sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" /></p>
<p>In all these countries, DevOps specialists are the top earners. We also often see the same handful of developer roles near the top vs. the bottom of the range in each country. In our annual survey, we expect to sample differently along the distributions of experience, education, developer role, and other characteristics. Do embedded developers make relatively more in Germany than the United States, or do they as a population have more experience there? Can the high salaries of data scientists be accounted for by high education levels alone? To account for this and make the most confident predictions for our users, we built a model for salary that accounts for all of these characteristics at once. In the end, some developer roles such as DevOps are associated with higher salaries, some developer roles such as QA are associated with lower salaries, and many are not associated with any change from baseline, i.e., from the typical developer salary in any given country.</p>
<p>The specific technologies that developers use also impact salary. This year, the technologies most associated with high salary include Go, Scala, Redis, and React. These are also some of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved technologies</a> this year. As a data scientist, I would love to know how much of that relationship is causal, and which direction it goes in! Just like last year, some technologies like PHP are associated with lower salaries for developers, and some technologies like JavaScript are used so broadly that they do not affect salary up <em>or</em> down.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=jobs2019&amp;utm_content=headhunters"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11745" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy.png" alt="" width="600" height="500" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy.png 600w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy-300x250.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ad-5-Sidebar@2x-2-copy-270x225.png 270w " sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2>Building a model</h2>
<p>We again this year used <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/17336/how-exactly-does-one-control-for-other-variables">multiple linear regression</a> to predict salary from the model inputs, with <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/74542/why-does-the-lasso-provide-variable-selection">regularization to help with variable selection</a>, (i.e. which of the many technologies and developer roles we asked about on the survey are important predictors for salary). The salaries are modeled on a log scale, because the salary distributions are log-normal (as such distributions often are) with a long tail of very high salaries.</p>
<p>In this salary calculator, we report a predicted salary for the location, education, experience, and other information you enter. We also report a <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/16493/difference-between-confidence-intervals-and-prediction-intervals">50% prediction interval</a>. The specific statistical meaning of this interval is that we expect 50% of people with the same characteristics as you to have salaries within that range; it spans the 25th to 75th percentiles. The interval is just as important as the prediction itself (the 50th percentile), because it gives you an understanding of what the range of expected salaries could be.</p>
<p>This year, we built two models, one for countries with higher incomes and one for countries with lower incomes. We were able to achieve better salary predictions for developers in all countries with this approach, in terms of how well the models fit the data, compared to either building one model for all countries, building separate models for each country, or other approaches. One way we can evaluate how well a model fits data is to look at residuals, the differences between the predicted salaries and the known salaries for the dataset we used for modeling. Let’s look at the residuals for the countries and individual cities supported in the 2018 update to our salary calculator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9453" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/residuals-1-810x675.png" alt="" width="810" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/residuals-1-810x675.png 810w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/residuals-1-300x250.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/residuals-1-768x640.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/residuals-1-270x225.png 270w " sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></p>
<p>The residuals look pretty good overall, although there are a couple of things to notice and keep in mind. First of all, notice that the residuals are much higher for countries with lower incomes like India than countries with higher incomes like Sweden. We cannot predict incomes as accurately in countries with lower incomes. Second, notice the shape of the residuals for some countries such as the United States; there is less variation in the residuals at high salary than at low salary. Another way to say this is that the variance of the residuals isn’t constant, and this is called <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/52089/what-does-having-constant-variance-in-a-linear-regression-model-mean">heteroscedasticity</a>. It means that our dataset doesn’t quite meet the underlying assumptions of our model. In real life, developer salaries depend on <em>both</em> the characteristics we have taken into account in our model <em>and</em> other complex factors, some of which involve mild violations of the assumptions of our modeling. These are some of the limitations of our results, but the salaries and prediction intervals that we are reporting in our calculator this year offer reliable insight for developer salaries around the world.</p>
<p>This plot shows residuals and fitted salaries on a log scale, but salaries in the calculator itself are reported in natural units and the appropriate local currency for each user.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">amazing </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">efforts and collaboration between our veteran users and quite a few new faces that jumped in to help us with our inclusion efforts, our </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/conduct"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand new Code of Conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CoC) is rolling off the press and going into effect across the network today. For those of you that haven’t been following along with announcements we’ve been making on our Meta site, we’re replacing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">our current ‘Be nice’ policy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a formal, far less ambiguous and way more informative Code of Conduct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as our rules go, nothing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes: we’re just clarifying that we don’t have space for belittling language and condescension, while more deliberately setting people’s expectations surrounding what to expect when problems are flagged. By resolving some ambiguity, we’re able to apply the rules that we’ve had for quite some time more consistently, resulting in fewer instances where it seems like we didn’t have any rules at all. That’s the gist of it, but if you’ll indulge us, we’d like to take a deeper look into how we got here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social contracts are an essential cornerstone of any collaborative project. A group’s shared expectations of how its members should treat one another not only helps their project stay on course, but also help outsiders decide if the group seems like a safe place for them to contribute. Since its inception in mid-2008, Stack Overflow and our subsequent network of Stack Exchange sites managed to flourish under a </span><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080916123307/http://stackoverflow.com:80/faq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single guiding principle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that everyone was expected to follow:</span></p>
<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.. Be nice.</span></i></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow began with a community of folks that were avid readers and pundits of </span><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel On Software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding Horror</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As the initial community had some experience interacting with one another, “Be nice” was sufficient as a beacon to pull people back from over-enthusiastically critiquing other user’s contributions. We </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">knew</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what ‘nice’ meant; that caused us not to notice how ambiguous our policy was as our community ballooned from thousands to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of people in a very short amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gruenert and Whitaker </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/School-Culture-Rewired-Define-Transform/dp/1416619909"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made a very astute assertion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they said that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior the leader is willing to tolerate.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">People look at the best </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the worst that a new community might offer in exchange for a contribution, and our </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">worst </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">began to look increasingly troublesome over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at examples of things that people were reporting as making them feel unwelcome and it seemed like a bit of a paradox: phrases like “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that’s clearly not nice, why wasn’t that flagged and removed?” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dominated conversations that we were having about it. The reality became pretty clear: even </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/240839/the-new-new-be-nice-policy-code-of-conduct-updated-with-your-feedback"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our expanded ‘Be nice’ policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> simply was not specific enough to meet the needs of a much larger dynamic that our sites had grown to be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What became clear is that we needed to be way more specific about what we meant when we were asking people to be nice, how we hoped folks would react when they encountered behavior that wasn’t great, and some examples that would allow people to better embrace the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intent </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of what the document was hoping to accomplish. </span></p>
<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.. Be nice, here’s how, here’s why, and here’s what to do if someone isn’t.</span></i></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, please, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/conduct"><span style="font-weight: 400;">take a moment to read the new Code of Conduct now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s not long, it’s not wordy-and-legalese-y and in our long held tradition, we feel that it does a good job of assuming that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the vast majority </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of folks that use our sites always have the best intentions at heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we’re not done, not by a long shot. Our </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/07/10/welcome-wagon-classifying-comments-on-stack-overflow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research indicates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the most problematic places on our sites tend to be free-form comments, so we’re working diligently on coming up with a way that lets users express feedback through the system; this not only ensures that users see compassionate, actionable guidance, but also helps remove the perception that there are people taking pleasure in picking at their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re also </span><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/369682/ask-a-question-wizard-prototype"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on new features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help new users ask questions that are much more in line with what our active community needs in order to provide fast and accurate answers. With Stack Overflow soon turning 10, a UX audit and overhaul to help ensure users discover the right information and tools at the right time is long overdue. Our efforts in this department are perennial; there will always be room for improvements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our CoC is what we call a living document. It’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to change over time to ensure that it remains relevant by continuing to meet the needs of our communities. Every six months or so, we plan to find out how folks feel about how things are going by asking both new and experienced users about their recent experiences on the site. There’s also a </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/code-of-conduct"><span style="font-weight: 400;">code of conduct tag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> folks can use on </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta Stack Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ask questions about, or propose changes to the CoC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we’d like to thank everyone that patiently worked with us in order to come up with a code of conduct that we think will make folks feel safe about contributing, but not so formal that it feels like oppressive, humid air. </span><b>If it were not for our most engaged users working in tandem with many people that we only started reaching once they heard that we were working on this, we wouldn’t have anything close to what we accomplished together.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We’re sincerely lucky to have all of you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, be nice to one another— all of you deserve nothing less than that. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Joe <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/06/21/rolling-out-the-welcome-wagon-june-update/">wrote about the Welcome Wagon work</a> that we are doing to make Stack Overflow more welcoming and inclusive. Our current work involves projects across domains from asking questions to framing community standards and more; one project we have been working on is understanding how comments are used and misused on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>We are a data engineer (Jason) and data scientist (Julia). As folks who code for a living and <em>use</em> Stack Overflow, as well as work here, we have certainly experienced and witnessed unwelcoming behavior in Stack Overflow comments first hand, whether through condescension, snark, or sarcasm. Our goal with this specific project is to understanding these issues so that we can start to address them. This blog post outlines our initial findings, what we could learn with more data, and next steps.</p>
<h2>Classifying comments</h2>
<p>I (Jason) wrote The Stack Overflow Comment Evaluator 5000<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, a simple application that presents you with a comment thread from a post on Stack Overflow and asks you to rate each comment in the thread as Fine, Unwelcoming, or Abusive.</p>
<p>Comments on Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/flagging">can already be flagged for being rude or abusive</a>, but this flag is typically used only for the most egregious and toxic comments, which are thankfully rare. We&#8217;re looking here to characterize comments that are unwelcoming in a way that isn&#8217;t flagrant hate or abuse but would still make you think twice about participating in our community. Things we thought might fall into this category would include condescension, snark, sarcasm, and the like.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vJG0K.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We estimated how many comments we could rate, given the number of folks we have internally and the time we would be asking of them. Then we loaded up the right number of comment threads into the application and invited all of our community managers, designers, developers, executives, site reliability engineers, and product managers to spend an hour rating comments. We had 57 participants who made 13,742 ratings on 3,992 comments.</p>
<h2>Prevalence of comment categories</h2>
<p>If we take a majority vote on the rating of each comment (with ties going to the worse rating) comments on Stack Overflow break down like so&#8230;</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Rating</th>
<th align="right">% of comments</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Fine</td>
<td align="right">92.3%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Unwelcoming</td>
<td align="right">7.4%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Abusive</td>
<td align="right">0.3%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to those of us deeply involved here and familiar with Stack Overflow, about 7% of comments on Stack Overflow are unwelcoming. What did some unwelcoming comments look like? These combine elements of real comments to show typical examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;This is becoming a waste of my time and you won&#8217;t listen to my advice. What are the supposed benefits of making it so much more complex?&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8220;Step 1. Do not clutter the namespace. Then get back to us.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8220;The code you posted cannot yield this result. Please post the real code if you hope to get any help.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8220;This error is self explanatory. You need to check&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8220;I have already told how you can&#8230; If you can&#8217;t make it work, you are doing something wrong.&#8221;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This stuff isn&#8217;t profane, hate, or outright abuse, but it&#8217;s certainly unwelcoming. Looking at majority voting is one approach, but the experience of being not welcomed is not a majority vote kind of thing; it&#8217;s deeply personal. What if we looked at the distributions of the ratings by individual?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9385" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rating_hist-1-1080x675.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rating_hist-1-1080x675.png 1080w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rating_hist-1-300x188.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rating_hist-1-768x480.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rating_hist-1-360x225.png 360w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Among the 57 individuals who participated, the median result for comments that are neutral or fine was 93.2% and the median result for unwelcoming comments was 6.5%. We can see from this graph that there is considerable variety in people&#8217;s experience of the site with respect to the comments they saw; the histograms have a broad shape. Take a look at just the distribution for the unwelcoming ratings. Four of us didn&#8217;t find anything unwelcoming, and three of us thought that in excess of 1 in 5 comments were unwelcoming. This speaks to the variability of experience; for example, what an experienced, professional developer from a privileged background finds unwelcoming may not be the same as for a more junior, or less privileged developer.</p>
<h2>What can we learn from our initial rating task?</h2>
<p>In this first attempt at rating comments, we have been able to measure the prevalence of unwelcoming comments, as perceived by experienced Stack Overflow community members/employees, as well as how much that varies. This first group of raters includes people from underrepresented groups in tech such as women, people of color, gay folks, and trans folks. We do <em>not</em> see evidence that having an identity in one or more of these groups led to an individual labeling comments as unwelcoming at a higher rate, at least not among the small group of ~60 participants in our initial task. It is possible that we would see a statistical difference with a larger sample size of raters.</p>
<p>There are enough comments in this first rating task for us to assess whether unwelcoming comments are more prevalent on questions or answers on Stack Overflow. Let&#8217;s compare all the comments from the month the rated comments were drawn from, along with the rated comments.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9384" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/comment_proportions-1-1200x600.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/comment_proportions-1-1200x600.png 1200w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/comment_proportions-1-300x150.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/comment_proportions-1-768x384.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/comment_proportions-1-400x200.png 400w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/comment_proportions-1-320x160.png 320w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The proportions of comments that were classified as fine by the raters are consistent on questions and answers with the population of comments overall. We see a shift for the comments classified as unwelcoming or abusive, however; those comments are more prevalent on questions than answers, with a relative percentage shift of almost 10%. When we think through what is contributing to unwelcoming comments in our community and what to do next, this is important to keep in mind. Indeed, the dynamics at play here are part of why <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/369682/ask-a-question-wizard-prototype">we are revamping our workflow for new askers</a>.</p>
<p>We also would like to look at how much this sample of raters agree with each other with some measure of inter-rater reliability. You might guess from the histogram of rating distributions that the inter-rater reliability is not going to be high; we labeled comments as unwelcoming at different rates. Given the kind of rating data we have (not every person saw every comment) we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha">Krippendorff&#8217;s alpha</a> to measure reliability; this is a measure that ranges from zero (nobody agrees) to one (perfect agreement). For comments that were rated by at least three people, Krippendorff&#8217;s alpha for this initial dataset is 0.39. This would be too low for qualitative research in an academic study like those done in the social sciences. If you have been around Stack Overflow a long time, you might be interested to know that this is <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/33566/is-joel-spolskys-hunting-of-the-snark-post-valid-statistical-content-analysis">much better than the reliability for the comment classification project</a> done using Amazon Mechanical Turk about 5 years ago.</p>
<p>What does a reliability measure like this mean? It reflects the real diversity in how we all experience the Stack Overflow community, based on our experiences and personalities. People who work at Stack Overflow agree more about what is unwelcoming than the Mechanical Turk workers did, but even the 60 or so of us do not agree enough that we could code comments reliably enough to be used in academic work. What this diversity of thought does <em>not</em> mean, to be clear, is that it is hopeless to address issues in how comments are being used for our community as a whole. We can take what we are learning here and move forward.</p>
<h2>Impact of unwelcoming comments</h2>
<p>So about 7% of comments on Stack Overflow are unwelcoming, depending on who you ask. What does that mean? First of all, this is <strong>not good enough for us</strong>. Stack Overflow is a place for developers to help each other; our goal is to be a professional space that makes our industry, our profession, and yes, the internet a better place. Everyone who codes should feel welcome to participate here.</p>
<p>Second of all, a prevalence between 5% and 10% can have a big impact on a community. Let&#8217;s sketch out a back-of-the-napkin estimate. If a typical developer visits Stack Overflow once or twice a week to solve a problem, the question they visit has an answer, and each post (question and answer) has two comments (keep in mind that comments are <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311737/lets-hold-language-in-comments-to-the-same-standard-as-posts">more visible to visitors than answers</a>), we would conservatively estimate that a developer visiting Stack Overflow would see 1 to 3 condescending, unwelcoming comments <strong>every single month</strong> of their coding lives. Will one unwelcoming comment a month drive everyone away? Clearly not, as Stack Overflow still works for many. But it will convince some that it&#8217;s not worth it to contribute here, and the next month’s comment will convince a few more, and so on. And this only considers the readers of these comments; those who the comments are directed at will naturally feel more dramatic effects.</p>
<p>So, where does that bring us now?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the first step for us in addressing how comments are used at Stack Overflow, and we are exploring options for moving forward. We believe strongly both that human moderators are key and that human-in-the-loop machine learning can offer us powerful tooling.</li>
<li>It takes care to be understood well online, and people have different reactions to the same words. Remember that many more people than the post owner may read your comments, so write for posterity and make a conscious effort. When you see unwelcoming behavior, please flag it.</li>
<li>We at Stack Overflow want to more clearly frame our expectations around our community standards. Watch for updates about the evolution of our <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice">&#8220;Be Nice&#8221; policy</a> into a <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/312038/wed-like-your-feedback-on-our-new-code-of-conduct">fully articulated code of conduct</a>.</li>
<li>We will be fielding this comment classification task more broadly soon, in order to learn more about how our community understands interaction via comments. Look for further work from us on this in the near future.</li>
</ul>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in late Spring, we posted “</span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow Isn’t Very Welcoming. It’s Time for That to Change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” We know it’s all too common for companies to announce they really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">want </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do a thing, and then… not much happens. So, it is time to share the work we’ve been doing behind the scenes and how our team of data scientists, developers, long term community managers, and UX specialists will continue iterating on our plans for the future.</span></p>
<h2><b>Done</b></h2>
<h3><b>Shipped the “Ask a Question Wizard” prototype</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9357" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AaQ-wizard-1081x675.png" alt="Ask a question wizard" width="1024" height="639" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AaQ-wizard-1081x675.png 1081w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AaQ-wizard-300x187.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AaQ-wizard-768x479.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/AaQ-wizard-360x225.png 360w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new workflow should help new askers craft questions more successfully with less stress. Each step gathers specific input that’s generally needed to help answerers. As we test it, we can expand this design to support additional question types. We’ve already done a couple rounds of user testing and are now gathering feedback from the community. You can </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask/wizard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check it out here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/369682/ask-a-question-wizard-prototype"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leave feedback on this post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Built an “Unwelcoming or snarky” comments classification app</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our users have always been really great at flagging and removing outright abusive comments, but we’ve long struggled to deal with (or even define clearly) lower-key unpleasantness: condescension, snark, dismissiveness. We just finished our first step to change that: 57 employees provided 13,742 ratings of “fine,” “unwelcoming or snarky,” or “abusive,” on random comments on SO, and we’ll be sharing the initial results and our next steps in a separate post.</span></p>
<h3><b>Created a prioritized queue of 67 other next up</b> <b>initiatives</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these are already in active discussion with the community, like </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310974/lets-remove-the-auto-downvote-on-validated-vlq-flags-on-questions/311037#311037"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing auto-downvotes that come with certain flags</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The key here is that we will always have a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">next </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative to move forward for discussions, input, and implementation, so we won’t lose momentum.</span></p>
<h2><b>In progress</b></h2>
<h3><b>Comment flagging improvements </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working on various improvements to comment flagging to increase visibility and </span><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311459/allow-new-users-to-flag-comments-on-their-own-posts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow more people to participate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this critical activity.</span></p>
<h3><b>Community/civility partnerships </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve connected to individuals (researchers, academics, community managers and data scientists) from many institutions and companies that are concerned about civility on the internet. We’ve kicked off collaborations with a couple companies to build machine learning approaches that can address civility in internet scale communities. More data can train smarter analysis, so we are optimistic about these collaborations.  Machine learning isn’t a magic solution nor will it be our only avenue for partnerships, but it will be a part of our toolkit. We hope to have more to share soon.</span></p>
<h3><b>Upgrading our community standards</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are undertaking a full review of our community standards, including an overhaul of our <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice">&#8220;Be Nice&#8221; policy</a> to evolve it into a full fledged code of conduct, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which better articulates exactly what we expect and how those expectations are enforced. Our first draft is almost done and we’ll be sharing it for feedback early next week.</span></p>
<h2><b>Our internal framework to attack the problem</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve created a framework to help us ensure we’re being disciplined in how we define the problems and prioritize solutions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding exclusion</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to fully understand the scope and depth of the problem. Using data insights and UX research we are attempting to answer questions like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the negative experiences people have had while using Stack Overflow?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the site functions that contribute to negative feelings, expectations, and/or experiences?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the behaviors that contribute to negative feelings, expectations, or experiences?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Learn from others’ inclusion efforts</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By engaging and working with others who are actively tackling inclusion efforts (particularly other companies dealing with internet scale communities) we want to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn, learn, learn. We aren’t the experts. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigate solutions from other online communities who had to address similar issues.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Solve for one, extend to many</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that by focusing on excluded people we can make Stack Overflow (and the entire Stack Exchange network of Q&amp;A sites) better for everyone. We are committed to making changes in: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">community standards</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">enforcement mechanisms</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">the software that runs the site.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Engage the broad community</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We commit to an open dialog about our goals, understanding of the problem, ideas for research and solutions and progress on both Meta and our blog.</span></p>
<h2><b>Next up</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will be providing regular updates on the work we are doing around inclusion. Soon, we’ll be sharing more details in separate posts on the Ask a Question Wizard, what we learned from our comment classifier, and our proposed new code of conduct. We’re on a long road here, but we’re excited about our progress so far. We hope you’ll stick with us for the rest of the ride.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, you can access the public data release for <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">Stack Overflow&#8217;s 2018 Developer Survey</a>. Over 100,000 developers from around the world shared their opinions about everything from their favorite technologies to job preferences, and this data is now available for you to analyze yourself. This year, we are partnering with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_campaign=developer+survey+2018">Kaggle</a> to publish and highlight this dataset. This means you can access the data both <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/">here on our site</a> and on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_campaign=developer+survey+2018">Kaggle Datasets</a>, and that on Kaggle, you can explore the dataset using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kernels?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_campaign=developer+survey+2018">Kernels</a>. Kaggle is awarding two $1,000 awards over the next two weeks to authors of top Kernels on the Stack Overflow dataset.</p>
<p>In this year&#8217;s survey, we covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. We also found, as we have in past years, that underrepresented groups in tech responded to our survey at even lower rates than we would expect from their participation in the workforce. There are 98,855 responses in this public data release. These responses are what we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on completion and time spent on the survey and included at least one non-PII question. Of the qualified responses, 67,441 completed the entire survey.</p>
<p>There are many things we can learn from a large, rich dataset like this one, and we use this data throughout the year to explore questions about <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/22/remote-work-2017-developer-survey/">remote work</a> to those about <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/19/much-developers-earn-find-stack-overflow-salary-calculator/">developer salaries</a> to <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/">how to help companies hire or engage with developers</a>. One issue we are exploring at Stack Overflow is how we can improve our site and community so that <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/">all our users feel welcome and included here</a>. We asked several questions related to inclusion and friendliness, for tech in general and Stack Overflow in particular, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you consider yourself a member of the Stack Overflow community?</li>
<li>How frequently would you say you participate in Q&amp;A on Stack Overflow?</li>
<li>To what extent do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements?
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I think of myself as competing with my peers&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;m not as good at programming as most of my peers&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I feel a sense of kinship or connection to other developers&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at that first question, and see some of the types of insights we can draw from our survey. It is always important to keep in mind how online surveys like ours are <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#methodology">fielded when interpreting them</a>, i.e., we do not have a perfectly representative sample of the world&#8217;s developers. However, a survey like ours still offers an enormous opportunity for learning about developers and the Stack Overflow community.</p>
<p>For starters, let&#8217;s think about how often someone participates on Stack Overflow and their feeling of belonging here, and how that interacts with what kind of developer they are.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9337" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/devtype-1-928x675.png" alt="" width="928" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/devtype-1-928x675.png 928w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/devtype-1-300x218.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/devtype-1-768x559.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/devtype-1-309x225.png 309w " sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></p>
<p>There is an upward trend in this plot, indicating that developers who say they participate more often also say they feel like they are part of our community at higher rates. This makes sense. But let&#8217;s also look at how the different kinds of developers are distributed. Mobile developers are located high above the line in this plot, meaning they feel like they belong at Stack Overflow at high rates compared to how often they participate. That&#8217;s good news for this group! Academic researchers report that they participate here on Stack Overflow at even higher rates than the group of mobile developers overall, but they feel like they belong here much less. Not so good news. Systems administrators, DevOps specialists, and developers working with embedded devices are other groups who do not feel part of the community here relative to how often they participate. This is information we are glad to have, because Stack Overflow is a community for all of these kinds of people and we can make decisions going forward to address this.</p>
<p>We asked respondents what they studied (or are currently studying) as their undergraduate major. How is this related to feelings of belonging here at Stack Overflow?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9339" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/undergrad-1-675x675.png" alt="" width="675" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/undergrad-1-675x675.png 675w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/undergrad-1-150x150.png 150w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/undergrad-1-300x300.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/undergrad-1-768x768.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/undergrad-1-225x225.png 225w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/undergrad-1.png 1350w " sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></p>
<p>There are not noticeable differences between majors like computer science, other engineering disciplines, and web development. Health science majors are also in that top cluster of majors with the highest reported feelings of belonging. Developers who come from academic backgrounds in the humanities, fine arts, and social sciences are <em>less</em> likely to say they consider themselves part of our community. This is valuable information for us at Stack Overflow to keep in mind as we move forward, especially since the tech industry has so much to gain by learning from those coming from these fields. I&#8217;ve seen this for myself in data science; the influence of digital humanities and social science scholarship has been enormously important for responsible, ethical data science.</p>
<p>What about gender and feeling like you belong here at Stack Overflow? Let&#8217;s combine this question with years of coding experience.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9338" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gender_experience-1-1080x675.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gender_experience-1-1080x675.png 1080w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gender_experience-1-300x188.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gender_experience-1-768x480.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gender_experience-1-360x225.png 360w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gender_experience-1.png 1440w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>For men, there is no dramatic change in feeling of belonging with years of coding experience; men who are new to coding feel like they are part of the Stack Overflow community at the same rate as men who have many years of coding experience. Other groups say they belong here at Stack Overflow at lower rates overall, but they <em>do</em> exhibit some changes with experience. For example, women with the highest levels of coding experience (25 or more years) say they feel a part of Stack Overflow at about the same rate as men. The same is not true for women with less experience; the rates of identifying as part of the Stack Overflow community are about 15 percentage points lower. There are not many non-binary developers in our sample, but their answers exhibit about the same pattern as women. There could be lots of interesting reasons why we might find this kind of pattern (this may be a great example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a>) but this is again something that it is important for us and our community to know. If we want all kinds of users to experience Stack Overflow as a welcoming place, we need to see where that is less true right now.</p>
<p>These are just three examples of how we can use this year&#8217;s survey data to gain valuable insights into the developer community. I have put the R code for these analyses and graphs into a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/juliasilge/stack-overflow-feeling-of-belonging?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_campaign=developer+survey+2018">Kaggle Kernel</a> here so you can see it for yourself. Want to dive into the results more deeply and see what you can learn about salaries or ethics or machine learning or diversity in tech? We look forward to seeing what you find! Remember that Kaggle will be awarding two $1,000 awards over the next two weeks for top Kernels for this dataset so <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey?utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_source=stackoverflow&amp;utm_campaign=developer+survey+2018">take a look at the dataset</a> and get started on your own analysis. Or as always you can <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/survey-2018">share results on Meta</a> using the <code>[survey-2018]</code> tag. Happy exploring!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when I was a full-time programmer and there was some code someone struggled with, it was a common practice to ask around in cubicle land. Sometimes you’d get lucky and find someone who know the answer right away or knew where to look in the documentation. When Stack Overflow launched, I cultivated a habit of asking and immediately answering questions I’d heard discussed at the office on the site. To this day, I get upvotes on questions like “</span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/583889/how-can-you-untar-more-than-one-file-at-a-time"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you untar more than one file at a time?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” It doesn’t just add to my reputation score—it also feels great to know I’ve helped dozens¹</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of strangers. How often can you say that about an hour or so of effort?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, most of the questions people on my team had were more like, “How do I check the current state of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resource_server</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” If you don’t know what that means, don’t feel bad. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resource_server</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a part of a proprietary system our company built. Maybe a dozen people could ever use that answer. Instead of posting on Stack Overflow, I’d either send it in an email or, if I thought it was important enough, add it to the enormous Word document that we called “the manual”. The manual was more or less write-only judging by the number of times people would re-ask questions </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that were clearly documented in section 6, paragraph 19!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sometimes I’d stare at the hardcopy version on my desk and wonder where I’d gone wrong in life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely unrelated reasons</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I left that job and joined Stack Overflow as a community manager. Much of what I needed to know was documented on our meta site for questions about the network. But imagine my dismay when I discovered our team also had a Google Docs version of “the manual” for non-public information. This seemed crazy since we had access to the world’s best Q&amp;A system. Later, we switched to our own internal </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise instance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which worked pretty well for a few weeks. But after the initial wave of questions, things slowed down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn’t unexpected. Since Stack Overflow Enterprise exists on a separate site, making it part of your workflow requires a constant supply of new content. Based on our experience with public sites and Enterprise customers, we estimate a standalone site needs about 500 total users. Fewer than that and there’s just not enough activity to keep people regularly engaged. As the name implies, the Enterprise product serves larger organizations that need features such as single sign-on and moderation roles. On Enterprise sites </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/10/07/membership-has-its-privileges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privilege levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are tuned for larger groups of active users.²</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our entire company doesn’t exceed our definition of an Enterprise organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve tried other solutions, including wikis, forums, Slack and Trello. Nothing works as well as the question and answer format. But a Q&amp;A site needs some minimal level of activity so that people who have answers will keep visiting. And that’s where </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes in. Instead of going to a separate site, Stack Overflow for Teams puts your private Q&amp;A on the site most programmers visit routinely as a part of their job. We’ve been using our internal Team instance for half-a-year, and I think we’ve finally got a viable replacement for “the manual”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is great news for organizations who are signing up for Teams right now, but what about everyone else? Won’t this mean more of the world’s knowledge is locked away in private silos? If you’ve been around the network for a while, you might recall we had a “too localized” close reason. Teams are a perfect place to ask questions without universal answers. Coding standard questions don’t work well on a public site since every organization has their own brace style (as an example). Sensitive information can’t be posted publicly either but is safe in Stack Overflow for Teams. In other words, much of the content posted in Teams isn’t appropriate for the public site anyway.  If you do have a question that makes sense outside of your organization, the breadth of potential answers mean it’s best to ask in public instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, we’re hearing that some organizations use the Q&amp;A format (both Teams and Enterprise) to preserve all sorts of other organizational information such as business logic, onboarding procedures, customer support questions and all kinds of documentation.³</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These type of questions </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won’t fly on the public site. But, you know, that’s fine. The more reason people have to visit the site, the more useful it will be for everyone in the organization. And, of course, the more people who use the site, the more likely questions will get answered from someone in the know. It’s a virtuous cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leads me to our super secret strategy for making the public site better as well. Along with your Team content, we mix in public content whenever appropriate. For instance when you do a search, you’ll find not only posts from your team, but also posts from the rest of the site:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9330" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="386" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-1.png 957w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-1-300x145.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-1-768x371.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-1-400x193.png 400w " sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, that might not be the most useful example. But more than once, I’ve searched for an answer on my Team and found a corresponding public answer. Even though I work with some pretty great programmers, answers from outside my Team have been vetted by a more diverse group of developers. So more people become familiar with our </span><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/04/13/gamification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes quirky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system, and by exposing them to the whole site, we expect some will take the plunge to start editing and answering in public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the observant among you might have already noticed a catch: Team culture might be very different than the traditional Stack Overflow way of doing things. What’s going to happen, for instance, if some pointy-haired boss asks how to “utilize blockchain in container virtualization”? The UI goes to some lengths to make clear where your question will be posted, so one would hope this question will be restricted to the boss’s own team (who are presumably used to that sort of thing).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9331" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="277" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-2.png 955w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-2-300x104.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-2-768x266.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pickles-2-400x139.png 400w " sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting questions with people who can answer them can be more challenging when the audience is small. So we’re working on features that address discoverability. Within a Team, people can notify colleagues about questions. We don’t see that system scaling on the public side, but we have done some work to improve tag subscriptions that will soon be available for everyone. We’re also developing a feature for saving custom question views. Teams, Enterprise, Stack Overflow and the entire Stack Exchange network share a codebase, so improvements made in one context can be transferred to another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9332" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/create-a-custom-view-527x675.png" alt="" width="400" height="513" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/create-a-custom-view-527x675.png 527w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/create-a-custom-view-234x300.png 234w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/create-a-custom-view-176x225.png 176w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/create-a-custom-view.png 663w " sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, changes make me worried. Teams, however, don’t bother me much. Don’t get me wrong: Stack Overflow for Teams promise to be a real boon for companies that sign up. But if you aren’t on a Team just now, they are pretty much invisible to you. In the long run, it certainly doesn’t hurt that they provide some extra revenue for more developers, designers and community managers. (By the way, </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here/1161802/community-manager"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re hiring now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!) We’re grateful to have </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/15/how-we-make-money-at-stack-overflow-2016-edition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other lines of business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it sure is a pleasure to be refocused on our communities and Q&amp;A more directly.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"><strong>Learn more about Stack Overflow for Teams &gt;&gt;</strong></a></p>
<hr />
<p>¹ <span style="font-weight: 400;">And maybe it’s a lot more; the question has been viewed over 50k times.</span></p>
<p>² <span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a little guesswork here, but sociobiology suggests the upper limit is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 150 individuals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a site to work without hierarchical privileges.</span></p>
<p>³ <span style="font-weight: 400;">We even use our Team for scratch space to prepare drafts of public announcements.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How we tested, designed, and built a brand-new Team onboarding process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, we released </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a way for teams to share information privately. A ton of work over the last year has been done to release this exciting new product. This post goes into how we designed the custom Team onboarding experience and how we see this feature possibly expanding in the future.</span></p>
<h3><b>Hard problems</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hardest problem at Stack Overflow isn’t creating the functionality to post questions or answers, notify users of these posts, calculate reputation, commenting, voting, or any of the other various tools that are used within a community (These are all core features to a Stack Overflow community.) The hardest problem is starting a community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever tried to start a forum discussion, chat, or other type of online group, you’ve experienced the massive amount of effort needed to start that group. And once the community starts generating some momentum, your work doesn’t go away—it shifts toward increasing the community’s momentum. It’s difficult work, which is rarely recognized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, if you’re a part of a community like this—take a minute and tell the community owners how much you appreciate the effort they put into helping shepherd and guide that community.</span></p>
<h3><b>Small(er) communities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interesting feature about the Stack Exchange network is that anyone can suggest creating a new community. If there’s a knowledge area that interests you and potentially interests others, you can submit your idea on our </span><a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Area 51” website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This website walks you through a number of steps to help you go from a community idea to an actual Q&amp;A community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One criteria we’ve held for new communities is that they need to be of a certain size and show consistent growth for us to “graduate” that community as an official Stack Exchange network site. There have been hundreds of proposals submitted, and failure to reach the needed community size is consistently a top reason for a community’s inability to graduate.</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding the problem</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the largest, initial problems for Stack Overflow for Teams then was a three-fold problem:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities are hard to start.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smaller communities are even tougher to start and maintain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An inability to solve problems 1 and 2 will mean Stack Overflow for Teams doesn’t have a future.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a big problem. It’s also a unique problem. How do we help anybody start their own private Q&amp;A community and be successful at it?</span></p>
<h3><b>Some key findings</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully we had already been starting to think about this problem for our Stack Overflow Enterprise customers. Through this team’s work and other work the User Research team conducted, we started to learn a few key things:</span></p>
<h4><b>1. Identify people who really care about this.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard work to start a community, and it becomes even harder if people don’t care about the community’s success.</span></p>
<h4><b>2. Starting with an empty community rarely works.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tempting once you create a Team to let everyone know about it. The idea is that if you build it, people will come—right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we find though is that people prefer to have some content already in place. This seeded content removes the decision paralysis that comes with a blank canvas: there are so many possible questions that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be asked, that you end up asking none.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeding content provides some ideas right away and helps people overcome this paralysis a lot quicker.</span></p>
<h4><b>3. Don’t go it alone.</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we find that starting with an empty community doesn’t work, the goal during setup becomes about creating some initial content before everyone else joins in. While this content could be created by 1-2 people, we found that the task becomes a lot easier if its shared with 7-10 people. By sharing the community setup workload with this core group, the task becomes easier for everyone. </span></p>
<h3><b>Testing ideas</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this initial research, our next step was to test out these ideas. A typical project at this point at Stack Overflow would have had us writing a spec, creating some wireframes, designing artwork, and building a prototype before testing it with users. This process would take weeks for us to learn crucial information. We didn’t want to waste weeks to test an idea, so we changed our approach by testing lo-fidelity versions within a couple days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using slide decks and clickable prototypes we were able to test and adjust our ideas within a couple weeks versus a couple months. We knew that above all else, clear copy would win the day. So we created a simple Google Slide presentation with our proposed copy and interviewed a number of individuals to gauge their reactions.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9312" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9312" class="wp-image-9312" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/your-channel-is-created.png" alt="your channel is created" width="800" height="458" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/your-channel-is-created.png 1064w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/your-channel-is-created-300x172.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/your-channel-is-created-768x440.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/your-channel-is-created-393x225.png 393w " sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9312" class="wp-caption-text">An example slide from our initial wireframes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By testing the ideas out early and in such a low-fidelity manner, we discovered two things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By keeping things low-fidelity, we didn’t become attached to the idea. Since we hadn’t invested a lot of time in the ideas, letting go of them became easier.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we were able to let go of ideas more easily, we were able to iterate more quickly.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether we were able to test multiple low-fidelity versions within a two-week period.</span></p>
<h3><b>Finalizing our checklists</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing we learned during our research was that people responded well to being provided a setup checklist. One person, upon seeing the checklist, remarked that it helped them better understand the effort level required to start their community, which they had not considered before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every feature or task holds some value—otherwise why would we have it? The hard part when creating onboarding workflows is identifying the core items people need to understand at specific moments in the process. For example, while it might be a good idea for someone to understand how to create a new tag, this isn’t a primary concern. Understanding how to create a tag only becomes important when people are asking and answering questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal was to help a Team focus on specific, core tasks during certain stages in their first 60–90 days. We divided these tasks into three groups:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Setup period:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Initial 10–14 days during which 5–10 people help seed content and get the Team setup for everyone else to join.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Launch day:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The day you’re ready to invite everyone into your community.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Post-launch:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Provide community goals for the next 45–75 days to help continue and maintain momentum.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><div id="attachment_9319" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9319" class="size-large wp-image-9319" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/onboarding-checklists@2x-1050x675.png" alt="The various sidebar guides that we present to users during the onboarding workflow." width="1024" height="658" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/onboarding-checklists@2x-1050x675.png 1050w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/onboarding-checklists@2x-300x193.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/onboarding-checklists@2x-768x494.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/onboarding-checklists@2x-350x225.png 350w " sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9319" class="wp-caption-text">The various sidebar guides that we present to users during the onboarding workflow.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every task within these checklists reinforced core activities that are regularly found within successful communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the checklists, we also created starter questions. Going back to one of our original key findings: “Starting with an empty community rarely works.”, we found this applies to Team creators and guides as well! To help this first group get started, we provide questions that range from identifying people within a team to type of questions that should be asked. These unanswered questions allow for admins and Team Guides to jump in right away and start providing thoughts.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9314" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9314" class="wp-image-9314" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/company-inc-launch-day-864x675.png" alt="company inc launch day" width="800" height="625" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/company-inc-launch-day-864x675.png 864w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/company-inc-launch-day-300x234.png 300w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/company-inc-launch-day-768x600.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/company-inc-launch-day-288x225.png 288w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/company-inc-launch-day.png 1077w " sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9314" class="wp-caption-text">An example of a clickable prototype that we tested</p></div></p>
<h3><b>Looking ahead</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just the beginning for onboarding. Our goal isn’t just to start communities, but to create strong, healthy, lasting communities that are trusted sources for a team. But that doesn’t happen if people don’t continually participate. So we’re exploring how we can continue to help teams as they reach the 90-day period and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we know it’s not perfect and we’ll continue to test and observe communities as they use the current onboarding process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also excited about the possibility of taking this work and bringing it back to Area 51 for public communities. Much of what we’ve done within Teams applies within a public community setting as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy, strong communities don’t just happen. They’re products of purposeful, diligent work from a cohort of dedicated individuals that help provide a place for others to join in and share. By providing initial guidance, we hope that everyone will feel confident in starting their own community today.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s here. After months of designing, building, testing, and beta-ing, we’re happy to announce that as of today, </span><a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com/teams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has launched and is available to everyone!</span></p>
<h2><strong>The What &amp; Why Of Stack Overflow for Teams</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It often feels like developers have to know everything, constantly juggling dozens of tools, languages, libraries, and frameworks. To do this, they have to be able to quickly find the information they need in order to get back to writing software. When that information is public, all you need is a quick search on Stack Overflow to turn up an answer and be on your way. But when that information is internal and private, it&#8217;s a maze of stale wikis and lost emails.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-9267 aligncenter" style="text-align: center;" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Question-and-Answer@4x-602x675.png" alt="Question and Answer" width="602" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Question-and-Answer@4x-602x675.png 602w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Question-and-Answer@4x-268x300.png 268w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Question-and-Answer@4x-768x861.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Question-and-Answer@4x-201x225.png 201w " sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams helps bridge that gap by bringing the power of Stack Overflow Q&amp;A to a private space just for you and your team on stackoverflow.com.  Ask and answer questions about all those proprietary, top-secret things that you can’t post to a public audience and create an accessible set of knowledge that you can come back to time and again. (No more having to re-answer the same question over and over again in chat!)  It uses the same Q&amp;A format, organization, and experience that you know from SO to help your team easily capture, organize, and find information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams doesn’t just provide you with the existing feature set of Stack Overflow, it also has new features that make it easier for new users and entire teams to use it, like guided onboarding for getting started, revamped tag watching and email notifications, and Slack integration. You can also access all of your team’s data through our API.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best of all, this all happens on stackoverflow.com — which your team probably already visits daily. When you search on stackoverflow.com, the private Q&amp;A is also integrated into those search results so you can access both your private information and the wealth of knowledge from the existing community all at once. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9300" src="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dashboard-Search-All@4x-505x675.png" alt="Dashboard Search All" width="505" height="675" srcset="https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dashboard-Search-All@4x-505x675.png 505w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dashboard-Search-All@4x-224x300.png 224w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dashboard-Search-All@4x-768x1027.png 768w , https://1015711.v1.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dashboard-Search-All@4x-168x225.png 168w " sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Making Knowledge More Accessible</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two years, dozens of large companies have adopted </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their own standalone, internal knowledge sharing communities in order to make proprietary information more easily discoverable. While Enterprise works great for these large (500+ developer) organizations, we needed to do something different for smaller teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who has deployed new software, particularly anything involving a knowledge sharing or community building, knows how hard it is to get users to come and show up in a new place. You need a lot of users and a lot of activity at the right time or you end up with a ghost town that nobody has any interest in. Drawing from our own experience in building hundreds of public and private communities, we built Stack Overflow for Teams to overcome many of these traditional challenges with adoption by placing the knowledge in a private space on stackoverflow.com. The combination of our onboarding tools, integrations, and hosting everything in one central location, means Stack Overflow for Teams works for any size group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During beta, we’ve seen teams as small as five and as large as 200 adopt Stack Overflow for Teams successfully. </span>Tim Golen, Engineering Lead at Expensify, summed it up pretty well: “We needed a good way of passing down knowledge between team members, because we saw the same questions being asked over and over in our instant message channels. Almost immediately, we found that the Search function in Teams returned relevant results in a quicker, more accurate way than chat would. We anticipate Stack Overflow for Teams increasingly becoming our go-to resource for knowledge-sharing.” <span style="font-weight: 400;">We see similar results not just at our other beta users, but also internally through our own usage of Stack Overflow for Teams.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Get Started Now</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Overflow for Teams is available to everyone now — there’s a 14 day free-trial and after that it’s only $10/month for your first 10 users (additional users are $5/month). All you need to get started are a few teammates and questions that you know come up over and over again — we’ll guide you through the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/teams"><b>go create your Team</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and let us know what you think! </span></p>
