<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This is a post by ProBlogger writing expert Ali Luke</span></p>
<p>Do you get sick of writing sometimes?</p>
<p>Even the most enthusiastic bloggers have days when they struggle to get the words out. Perhaps you’ve been writing a lot, or you simply aren’t feeling very creative.</p>
<p>But what can you do?</p>
<p>One option is to do away with most of the words. You could create a very short post, or one that focuses on images or videos instead of written words.</p>
<p>But if you want to publish a full-length written post, you need to take a different approach.</p>
<p>Here are four different things you can try.</p>
<h2>#1: List of Quotes: Bring Together Several Quotes on a Topic</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One easy way to “write” a blog post is to choose some good quotes on your topic and bring them together.</span> Of course, you should ensure you’re using those quotes legally and ethically. That means, at a minimum, citing the author or speaker of each quote.</p>
<p>Some bloggers do this with inspirational or famous quotes. You can find loads of these on sites such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.brainyquote.com/">BrainyQuote</a></span> or the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.goodreads.com/quotes">Popular Quotes section on Goodreads</a></span>. (It’s always worth doing a bit more digging to make sure the quote has been recorded and attributed accurately. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://quoteinvestigator.com/">Quote Investigator</a></span> does brilliant work tracking down the original source of various popular quotes.)</p>
<p>With many blog topics, instead of opting for well-known quotes you could look at articles and books in your niche and draw quotes from those.</p>
<h3>Possible Post Titles:</h3>
<ul>
<li>X Inspiring Quotes About [Topic]</li>
<li>Where’s [Topic] Heading in 2020? Here’s What [X] Bloggers Think</li>
<li>X Quotes About [Topic] That Will Make You Laugh</li>
</ul>
<h2>#2: Expert Roundup: Run Multiple Short Email Interviews and Publish the Results</h2>
<p>Perhaps tracking down loads of quotes on a very specific topic or question will be tricky or time consuming.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">An </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://smartblogger.com/expert-roundup/">expert roundup</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> is a great alternative.</span> This is where you approach a number of experts in your niche (some roundups have as many as 50 or 100 quotes) and ask them to answer a question. Some bloggers call this a “one-question interview”.</p>
<p>You then bring together all the answers into a single post, normally linking to each expert (and potentially including their headshot).</p>
<p>These posts can be a great way to build a stronger relationship with influencers in your niche. And many influencers will also willingly share your post because they’ve been quoted in it.</p>
<h3>Possible Post Titles:</h3>
<ul>
<li>X Experts Speak Out About [Topic]</li>
<li>Wondering What’s The Best [Technique/Tool/Book/etc]? Here’s What X Experts Recommend</li>
<li>We Asked [X] Experts for their Best Tip on [Topic]. Here’s What They Said.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#3: “Over to You”: Using Your Reader’s Comments or Social Media Posts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One source of blog post material you might not have considered is your readers’ comments. </span>Readers sometimes leave very thoughtful, insightful comments on your blog (or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/get-more-facebook-comments/">your Facebook page</a></span>) you might want to share with your entire audience.</p>
<p>If someone comments on your blog, it’s probably safe to assume they’re happy for your readers to read that comment. Even so, it’s nice to check first that they don’t mind you quoting them in a blog post.</p>
<p>You could simply use their comment as a starting point for a post. But if you collect several great comments from different readers they could potentially make an entire post on their own. You could also do this deliberately by:</p>
<ul>
<li>putting up a blog post asking for comments you’ll use in a future piece</li>
<li>asking for responses to a particular question on Facebook. (If you do this, make it clear you plan to publish some of the responses on your blog.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Possible Post Titles:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Which [Item/Tool/etc] Do [Blog Name] Readers Use the Most? Here’s What Five [People/Enthusiasts/Etc] Said</li>
<li>Over to You: Here’s What [X] Readers Said About [Topic]</li>
<li>[X] Real-Life Tips From Fellow [Writers/Photographers/Parents/whatever word fits your blog’s audience]</li>
</ul>
<h2>#4: Link Roundup: Linking to Other People’s Blog Posts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another great way to create a valuable post, without writing much is to link to other people’s posts. </span>When I got into blogging a decade ago, quite a few blogs did this regularly. They’d write a post every week (often on a Friday) that rounded up great recent posts from other blogs in their niche.</p>
<p>Now that most people do their linking through social media rather than through their blogs, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-create-a-link-post-challenge/">link posts can really stand out</a></span>. You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>pick a topic and find a bunch of posts about that topic</li>
<li>run a regular link post (weekly or monthly, perhaps) where you pick recent posts or podcast episodes to link to.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each post (or other item) on your list, I’d suggest including the title (which should link to the post itself), the author’s name, and the name of the blog. Providing some sort of teaser or introduction will add even more value to your post. If you don’t want to write these, find a good quote from the post to include. Just make sure you use quotation marks or blockquote formatting so it’s clear they aren’t your own words.</p>
<h3>Possible Post Titles:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Friday Round-Up: The [X] Best Posts I’ve Read This Week</li>
<li>[X] Great Posts About [Topic]</li>
<li>The Only [X] Posts You Need to Read About [Topic]</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you don’t want to rely on what other bloggers have written <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span> much. But creating an occasional post that leans on or builds on the work of others is not only a legitimate option, but also a great way to offer your readers something a little different. And you’ll get a much-needed break from having to come up with fresh content of your own.</p>
<p>Which of these four post types might you try this week? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: Hey there friends and welcome to Episode 279 of the ProBlogger Podcast. My name is Darren Rowse and I’m the blogger behind problogger.com; a blog designed to help you to start and to grow a profitable blog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today on the podcast, we have a special guest, Jeff Goins. I’ve been wanting to bring Jeff Goins to the podcast for a while now. Many of you know of Jeff, he has a fantastic blog that I do encourage you to check out. We’ll link to it in the show notes today. He writes great advice for people who write. If you want to become a better writer, particularly if you want to write a book, he has some great advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to get Jeff on the show today to talk a little bit about how his business or his blogging business has evolved over the years, because he started a number of years ago now. What he’s doing today is very different to the way he started. He really started in a personal record keeping kind of way with his blogging and he’s grown his brand, and his business around that. As he says in this interview, he’s actually had nine blogs over the years and his last one has really built the business. He’s got a lot of great advice today as we talk about this idea of evolving your blog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today’s interview is actually a little bit different to any interview I’ve done before because I sent Jeff the questions via email and he recorded them in one hit. He kind of interviews himself, although the questions do come from me. It’s a new style of interview, it helps me to create this because we’re in different time zones. I really like what he’s put together, so this might be something we do in the future a little bit more because I think it’s very effective. In fact, Jeff says stuff during this interview that I really needed to hear on a personal level myself. I might talk a little bit about that at the end of this interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other reason I&#8217;m bringing on Jeff today is that he’s speaking at our upcoming ProBlogger Event in Melbourne on the 9th and 10th of August. We still do have a small number of tickets available to that, particularly the mastermind which Jeff is going to be at for two full days. If you enjoy Jeff in this and you can get to Melbourne, Australia on the 9th and 10th of August, go to</span><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~problogger.com/events"> <span style="font-weight: 400">problogger.com/events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and you can see what we’re running there. You might just be sitting around the table with Jeff for a couple of days in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going to hand over to Jeff now. At the end, I want to come back and just pull out some of the things that really impacted me in this interview of sorts. Here’s Jeff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeff: Hello, this is Jeff Goins. I am answering some questions that Darren sent me. I think what I’ll do is I will read the question, and then share my answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Question number one: how has your blog evolved to the point that it’s at now? Tell your evolution story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My blog really began as a series of different blogs over the years. My first blog was in 2006, 2005 and 2006 I was touring with a band all over North America and I wanted to catalog the journey. I started a blog on Xanga. I’d always journaled and written as a kid, and this was another outlet. This was a way for me to share my journey. I had a hand full of friends reading it. It was just fun to share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a big wake up call for me when halfway through this year of playing music for a living–which I had always thought was the dream–that my favorite part of the week was not playing shows for sometimes thousands of screaming, and sometimes thousands of indifferent teenagers. It was this hour in the afternoon usually on a Saturday or a Sunday where we would be staying with a family somewhere and I would ask to use their desktop computer and I would write a blog post cataloging what we have done that day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was my first blog and my first experience with sharing my life and my ideas with the world. Just the thrill of pressing publish and sharing that. This evolved into me moving to Nashville, getting a job with a nonprofit, actually training missionaries in how to blog for this nonprofit organization that I worked for for seven years. Becoming the Marketing Director there, learning about online marketing. In that process, deciding I wanted to get back into blogging for myself. I had been helping other people share their stories and I wanted to start doing it again for myself; I missed it, I felt like I had something to say and want to share it with the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the years, I had started these different blogs and fits and starts. Honestly, I’ve been following ProBlogger for a long, long time and wanted to make a living as a writer but didn’t know how to do that. I remember Darren sharing on a webinar that the first year as a full time blogger, he made $36,000. He was saying it like you&#8217;re not just going to start off making six-figures, it’s kind of hard. That was exactly my salary that year and I was like wow, I could replace my income with blogging? That sounded really exciting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had started all these blogs. I think I went back and counted recently, it was like nine different blogs. From that first Xanga blog in 2006, to 2010 when I at the end of the year started a blog called Goins, Writer,</span><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~goinswriter.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400">goinswriter.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which is the blog that I have today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was really frustrated with myself for quitting all those previous blogs. I realized that all those failed blogs had one thing in common, and that was that I quit them at some point. I had grown up a little bit, I had a little bit more responsibilities, I better understood marketing and what might, might not work in terms of a blog and a message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had decided when I started this blog at the end of 2010 when I was getting much more serious about writing for a living that I would do this for two years before I would quit. I would write every single day on this blog for two years without quitting. At the end of two years, if I didn’t have at least 250 subscribers, which was the most I’d ever had in any blog, then I would quit and go do something else. I wasn’t going to do it forever, but I was going to give it a good, solid try. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, I always heard of these blogs. Anywhere from six weeks to six months later, I would quit and I would go start something else. I thought what would just happen if I just stuck with it? That’s what I did. In 2011, I blogged every single day. I started paying attention to what I was learning on ProBlogger and Copy Blogger and following other writers and bloggers online. I reached out to them, I asked to guest post, I offered them opportunities to guest post on my site, and I just started building email lists. I learned about lead magnets and ways to get people on your subscriber list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the end of 2011, I’d grown an email list of about 10,000 people and realized that I could monetize this. Then in 2012, I sold a couple of ebooks and made about $50,000 off of this ebook called You Are A Writer, so Start Acting Like One. Then from there, I turned that ebook, essentially, into an online course called Tribe Writers and made an extra $100,000 or so off of that and some affiliate marketing that I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2012, I made about $150,000 in side income off of this little blog business that I had started in the last six months of the year. I was still working at this nonprofit, making about $30,000 a year. That year, my wife quit her job. She gave birth to our first child, our son Aiden. She quit her job, she didn’t go back after having our baby. I was getting ready to quit my job and we started this business. We tripled our household income in a matter of months. That was 2012, and in 2013 I quit my job, I turned 30. I’ve been a full time blogger, author, speaker, and online entrepreneur ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s been my blogging journey, lots of other stories in there. Where I&#8217;m at now is when I started the blog, I didn’t know what I wanted. I had a goal of replacing my wife’s income, which was about $30,000. I thought if I replace her income, I can keep my job and then do this thing on the side. I’ll essentially have two jobs, she can stay home and be a full time mom for a while which is something we agreed would be good, we both wanted that. This is what I would do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my initial goal was met and then exceeded, I didn’t really know what to do with that. I just started chasing more for the sake of getting more subscribers, trying to get more money, doubling and tripling our revenue every single year, growing a team, doing all this stuff. One day, I woke up and realized this isn’t what I wanted.What I wanted was way back there, it was this simple life and way to do my work where I was getting paid to write the stuff that I wanted to write.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A big wake up call for me was I started this online education business, teaching online courses so that I could write and make money. I wouldn’t have to worry about hitting the bestseller list every time and selling hundreds of thousands of copies of a book so that I could make an income off of my writing. I could just get paid and write books that I believed in, and not worry about them having to be bestsellers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a big wake up call for me when I realized that I was so busy running this education business that was supposed to provide the income and freedom for me to write that I no longer had time to write. I had actually hired a writer to write my blog posts for me. I realized man, something is off here. This business that I started so that I could be a writer is now keeping me from writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the past few years, I’ve had to make a series of difficult decisions to get back in my lane, get focused on the creative work which is the work that only I can do and not worry about what everybody else is doing. Just learn how to run my own race, and the results of that has been I have felt more successful, I have been happier with my work than I’d ever been, and just more at peace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, I think the work is better, I&#8217;m actually personally netting a higher income while generating fewer sales just because I’ve gotten really specific and focused on the work that I want to do, that only I can do. It doesn’t have anything to do with growing some huge media empire, it’s just about me doing the work that I believe in and sharing it with the world. That’s my blogging story and my answer to question one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Question two: what are three top tips behind the success you’ve achieved? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe that all education is broken up into three areas. One is principles, two is strategies, and then three is tools. A lot of people in the online marketing space like to talk about tools and strategies, meaning what’s working now and how do I do this? How do I grow my email list? Well, you need a lead magnet and you can set it up in MailChimp. MailChimp is a tool, the strategy is using a lead magnet to get more subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Underlying, most strategies and tools are principles. Tools change often, strategies change sometimes, principles never change. Principles are usually timeless truths. If they change, they change very gradually over the course of decades, if not centuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m very interested in the principles. A few principles that have worked well for me, that continue to work although the modalities, the strategies and tools that I use to accomplish these things have changed. One lesson that I’ve learned, one principle, is that you always have to give before you ask. You always have to give more than you want to take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard Gary Vaynerchuk talk about this in regards to his book Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. He said most people think that means give, give, give, take. It doesn’t mean give, give, give, take; it means to give, give, give, ask. For every ask: hey, sign up for my email list; hey, buy my book; hey, do this, do that; I want to give these three things away for free. A phrase that we use in a lot of courses with our students is you have to be relentlessly generous. You have to be relentlessly generous with your audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I would start a blog, it was about me, and of course it’s your words, it’s your ideas, it’s your story; in a sense, it is about you. Something that really, really helped and lots of people talk about this but get so focused on the practicality of it. You have to be generous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, giving, giving, giving, without asking. I wrote a free blog post every day for two years before I sold a single thing. I gave away ebooks, webinars, trainings, tools, all kinds of things for free. First of all, I didn’t even know what I was doing. I was just trying to figure it out, I was practicing in public sharing my work, trying to get feedback on the stuff that was resonating, that was valuable to me. I was also trying to build up a lot of trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of that two years—it was more like 18 months before I started making an income off of the blog—I started hearing from readers saying, “Hey, this is great. Thanks for sharing all this stuff with us for free. But, can we buy something from you? Can we pay you for something?” One of the lessons that I learned is that if you give, give, give, give, if you make it all about them, they—some of them—will make it about you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You really can give your way into success. Every new business pursuit, idea, I&#8217;m just finding ways to plant seeds of generosity, helping people without asking anything in return. I think more often than not, that comes back to me giving time, giving money, giving resources to my audience, to my friends, to my network. People that I know, just trying to spend that goodwill. Overtime, you become known as a helpful, resourceful person. When your name comes up in conversation, people talk about you in a positive way. It just spreads this positive brand, plus it feels good to help people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was one principle, it will never hurt you to out-give your audience. It will only ever help you. It is a great way to establish yourself from everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another tip, lesson, principle thing that I learned was to listen to what the people who have done this for a long time tell you to do. For a long time, I thought I don’t need to listen to Darren, he’s old. Just kidding. He’s been doing it for a long time and there are these timeless principles, like using a lead magnet. I thought I was above that and I was trying to pave my own path without first paying attention to the ways that this has always worked. It always works to give before you ask people to pay attention to you, to use a lead magnet to get somebody on your email list. That’s not tricking them and getting them in your email list, it’s rewarding them for their attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A really big moment for me was when I stopped thinking I knew everything and just started listening to anyone, especially those who had done things that I wanted to do. Assuming I knew nothing, taking the posture of a student and acting like an apprentice, then just trying things. Being willing to do what other people said without arguing about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Often, I talk with folks who are struggling to succeed with their blogs or online businesses. They go, “Oh yeah, I’ve tried that, I’ve heard that. Give me something new, give me a new idea.” It turns out that the oldest things that have worked for a long time are the techniques and strategies that are probably going to keep working for a long time, they just might need a fresh coat of paint on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do what works for other people, at least try it. Be humble enough to admit what you don’t know, become somebody else’s student, and try it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think the last thing that works really well for me is connecting with influential people. It sounds bad and I’ll explain what this means for me, but essentially leveraging their influence to grow my own influence. What that means is I would reach out to folks and I would try to be as helpful as possible, people like Darren Rowse, Brian Clarke, Seth Godin, Michael Hyatt, a lot of people in the blogging and online marketing space. I never said how can I be helpful because that’s not very helpful, but I always say hey, can I write a guest post for you? Or could I share this tip with your audience?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, there’s something in it for me when I would do that, but there was also something in it for them. I found that by simply meeting influencers, people that I considered mentors, and sharing something with their audiences, that was a fast pass to getting in front of a lot of people in a short amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How do you practically do this? Well, oct people don’t do this very well, I didn’t do this very well for a long time. It’s because you get in front of somebody and say hey, let me talk to your audience. That’s not going to work; they don’t trust you, they don’t know you, they don’t know if you have any right speaking to their audience. What I practiced without realizing it, and in retrospect I now think of it as the case study strategy. What I did was remember lesson number two, be humble enough to admit what you don’t know and try new things based on what other people are saying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second part of that is to become somebody’s case study. If I read something on Michael Hyatt’s blog that said you should have a lead magnet, I’ll go okay, great, I&#8217;m going to do that. I would go do whatever so and so influencer had said and I would implement it, and then I would report back to them. I would send them an email, or comment on their blog, or tweet back at them, reply to them on Twitter, and share the results. I would do this over, and over, and over again with people who were sharing advice particularly about blogging and online marketing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did this, I just thought of it as seeds. I thought of it as a way of being helpful to people that helped me by saying hey, you might want to know that this worked for me and I just want to say thanks. I did this enough times with enough people that some of them started talking about me. Michael Hyatt was one of these people where in a way I became one of his case studies. He had just had a book come out called Platform which I think came out in 2012. I was growing my platform at the time. It was working, and I was sharing it with him, and he actually invited me to write a chapter in that book about guest posting, which I had gotten really into and had shared with him how it had helped me grow my blog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That relationship probably saved me years of hustling. I think there was a number of people. There are plenty of people that said hey, this worked, and never heard back from them. But those that I did hear back from, I doubled down on that connection and built a relationship, a friendship with these people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That, lots of people talk about that, everybody wants to get in front of influential people and have them share their stuff with the world but it’s actually really hard unless you realize that these people who are constantly sharing advice very rarely hear back from people who are actually doing the work and applying the principles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what I call the case study strategy, you do what other people say that you should do and you let them know about it over time. You build a relationship with them, and some of these people will just talk, you don’t even have to ask. Sometimes you can ask, “Hey, can I do a guest post or share this on your podcast? Or would you endorse my book?” Whatever. I have found just by simply being the case study of the giants who have come before you, it can save you a lot of time and it can help you get your work in front of a much larger audience without having to spend years on building that audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those are some tips that I think were pretty helpful for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Question three: what’s the next step and the next challenge in your evolution? I’ve done the thing where I’ve worked with tens of thousands of customers buying courses, ebooks, and programs. That’s been cool, it’s made a lot of money, millions of dollars in income. The more I do this—I’ve been running my business for almost seven years now—the more interested I am in going deeper with fewer people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two things that I’m really interested in are masterminds, I currently run a mastermind of creative entrepreneurs, about 20 people. I&#8217;m wanting to keep growing that. We meet every week on Zoom, we meet in person three times a year. Really walking these creative entrepreneurial journeys out together, really fun. I love the impact, relationship, connection that happens, and community that happens in a space like that. I can see growing more groups like that, I love the mastermind experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Live events, doing a live conference for years has been really fun. This will be the last year of our conference called the Tribe Conference but I’ll probably do some more regional, smaller, mastermind kind of events. I like workshops. It’s funny, all the things that an online business afforded me—scale, opportunity, reach—a lot of people with a click of a mouse, being able to create a product once and share it with a lot of people, do it all online. In some ways, building an online business is moving me back towards offline activities, getting together in person, working with fewer people on ways that aren’t necessarily scalable. That’s where I&#8217;m seeing a lot of the impact. I’ll continue to do online programs and things like that, but I&#8217;m really excited about that, working with creative entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have a program, helping people write great books, it’s called Write A Bestseller. I like that a lot. I hope to focus more on that, helping people get their books out into the world, that’s something that I’m focusing on a lot, and less on how do people grow their blogs, and get better at internet marketing. I think there’s a lot of value there but there’s a lot of people who do that really well. What I do well is I write books and teach people how to do the same. I’m looking forward to doing more of that from a teaching perspective. That’s it, those are all the questions. I hope this was helpful, let me know if I can be of any more service to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will be speaking at the ProBlogger Event in August, hope to see you there. If you have any questions, feel free to email me, jeff@goinswriter.com. If there’s a question that you have for me that I wasn’t able to answer in this interview, feel free to shoot me an email. I’ll see you in Melbourne in August, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: Wow, thank you so much, Jeff, for your wise words today. As I said at the top of today’s show, got a lot out of this myself. Jeff is someone that I look to for advice as a writer. I quite often will bounce ideas off of Jeff, but he’s also someone who I think has a lot of good things to say of us who are building a business as well. You can check out Jeff’s site at</span><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~goinswriter.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400">goinswriter.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Check out all of the things that he’s got to say there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Few of the things that really stood out to me. Firstly, he really talked about the success of his latest venture,</span><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~goinswriter.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400">goinswriter.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. He has been answering the question what will happen if I stick with this? I really relate to that, because I think a lot of bloggers do have a series or a trail of half finished blogs behind them. One of the biggest things that really, I guess, gets in the way of success for many bloggers is they just don’t stick at it. Or, they have a series of blogs rather than one blog. I love that, Jeff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally did stick to blogging and got serious about it. He mentioned a number of things there that I think are really important for those who are just starting out; developing an email list was a big part of what he did. Having that email list of people who were regularly hearing from him really enabled him to monetize in the long run. I loved that advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I secondly really related to this idea of having the mindset shift that he realized what he wanted wasn’t more. I don&#8217;t know if that wake up call that he had was something that you relate to, but I find a lot of us as bloggers who have been around for a number of years and I’ve used this analogy in the past. It’s almost like we build a machine around what we’re passionate about, but the machine actually takes over and we spend our time feeding the machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeff talked a little bit about how he built a business which he thought would allow him to do what he loved, writing, but it actually stopped him from writing. I think a lot of bloggers actually get to this point, particularly bloggers who have had some success. Many of us do need to have these moments in our business where we realign, where we perhaps narrow our focus back down to the things that we really started out wanting to do. In the case of Jeff, it was writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really appreciate the fact that he shared that lesson that he had because it’s something that I know I’ve had to do periodically over the years, and perhaps even need to do at the moment as well. I thank Jeff for sharing that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His three top tips that led to his success. Firstly, you have to give before you ask; I love that line from Gary V. Give, give, give, and then ask; rather than give, give, give, and take. There’s a difference between asking and taking from your audience, and I think a lot of us as bloggers do have the temptation to just take instead of asking our audience I they would like to buy something from us. Be relentlessly generous was the advice there. I think that really does represent the success of many of the bloggers that I admire over the years, their generosity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Listen to those who have gone before you. Again, this is something that you’ve heard on this podcast before. The oldest things that have been working for a long time, it turns out those things will continue to work into the future. That’s why we do preach that you need to develop an email list. This is old fashion technology that continues to work today. Yes, we do need to learn how to continue to use it, and tweak it, and we’ve got podcasts here in the archive of ProBlogger that all about that. But don’t just latch onto all the new, sexy things that are coming out. Actually look at what’s already been working for decades now and latch onto those things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lastly, his advice to connect with influential people. I love that strategy that he talked about being the case study of the influencers. I just think it’s such brilliant advice. Actually, implement the advice of the people you want to get in the radar of. Then, tell them what happens, and then you become their case study. Whether that be as a guest post or an interview, or something that they just use in passing as an example. I can actually think of a number of people that that’s happened to, both that have approached me but also that I’ve approached others by being their case study. Brilliant advice, really encourage you to try that one out yourself. Influencers are looking for that feedback and they are looking for case studies that prove that their own advice work. Actually be the case study for an influencer. Brilliant advice, really wish I’d come up with that one myself, so thanks Jeff for sharing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love this interview, in fact I&#8217;m going to listen to it again because there’s more in there that I wanted to get into. You might want to go back and have another listen to today’s interview with Jeff. Please share it with anyone who you know of that needs to hear this advice. I really hope that this episode does get shared wildly because I think it’s got so much valuable stuff into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you would like to check out more from Jeff, you can head to</span><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~goinswriter.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400">goinswriter.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and also consider coming. I know it’s last minute notice now, to our August event in Melbourne. We do have a handful of tickets both to our beginner event—we have a whole day of training for our beginners who want to start a blog or who’ve just started their blog. Jeff will be talking at that, he’ll be giving a keynote on how to develop your voice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you&#8217;re a little bit more experienced, whether you are intermediate level or more advanced, Jeff will be at our mastermind event as well. As he mentioned in his interview, he loves masterminding and I’ve seen him in action at that type of event, he’s excellent, which is why we’ve got him to our event. Our events are in August in Melbourne. I know that cuts out some of you, but if you are able to get to Melbourne, head over to</span><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~problogger.com/events"> <span style="font-weight: 400">problogger.com/events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Hopefully, there’s still a few tickets available and we’d love to see you at that particular event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks for listening today. Our show notes today, and there’s a full transcription of this podcast at</span><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~problogger.com/podcast/279"> <span style="font-weight: 400">problogger.com/podcast/279</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<p>This post is based on episode 136 of the ProBlogger podcast.

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-evergreen-content-for-your-blog/">episode 136</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast.</span></p>
<p>Back in 2007 I was asked a question:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“If you could only write one type of content on your blogs forever, what would it be?”</span></p>
<p>My answer then is the same as my answer now: <span style="font-weight: bold;">evergreen content. </span></p>
<h2>What is Evergreen Content, and Why is it Important?</h2>
<p>Evergreen content is content that stays fresh for your readers. It doesn’t become dated, and is just as relevant years after you wrote it.</p>
<p>Now while a lot of blogs are very successful <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> writing evergreen content, I’ve definitely found it a great basis for my own blog’s success.</p>
<p>And I’m not the only blogger who thinks this. Here’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/how-to-build-large-audience/id863897795?i=343272137&amp;mt=2">what Tim Ferriss said in a podcast episode back in 2015</a></span>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re building an audience, the most labor efficient way to build an audience over time is to have evergreen content. I write long pieces that will be more valuable from an SEO real estate standpoint two years from the day I write it compared to the week it launches, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Were you to look at my back catalog and the stats—I’m on WordPress VIP—or Google Analytics, you would see that my most popular post that each get hundreds of thousands of visits per month were written several years ago. That’s very much by design, I’m not upset by that because I fully expect that some of the articles I write this year, for instance my post on Practical Thoughts on Suicide which is a very intense post, I expect that will continue to gather steam and be spread around and shared and a year from now will be right in the Top 10 rankings which is very important to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why write evergreen content? Because it’s a great way to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Help people: </span>Evergreen content is a great investment because it serves your readers as much in the future as when you write it. The piece of content you publish today can potentially have a positive impact on people in ten years’ time. That’s a pretty amazing thing.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get ongoing traffic:</span> In terms of traffic, evergreen content should cover a topic that will be searched for again and again. If you can choose a topic that’s a growing trend – something you think will be the next big thing in your niche – it can work out even better.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interlink your posts: </span>Evergreen content is the type of content you can refer back to in future posts. Many of the examples I’ll give you later from Digital Photography School and ProBlogger are cornerstone pieces of content I continue to drive traffic to from my ongoing posts.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Engage new readers:</span> You can link to evergreen content from your navigation menu or sidebar. On ProBlogger, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/make-money-blogging/">Make Money Blogging</a></span> is piece of evergreen content that’s been live for years. I update it from time to time, and I continue to drive traffic to it from blog posts as well as from our navigation.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Share repeatedly: </span>Evergreen content can be shared again and again on social media. If I review a new camera, I can probably promote it on social media for a couple of months before it becomes less relevant. But with a blog post that won’t become dated, I could keep sharing it for ten years.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Repurpose: </span>Once you have evergreen content in one format, you can repurpose it into another. For example, some of my podcast episodes started out as pieces I’d already published on the blog. If you have a piece of evergreen content that’s performing well, ask yourself what other mediums you could repurpose it into.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gather backlinks:</span> Evergreen content also tends to be the type of content other bloggers will want to link to, which can help you both direct traffic from that blog’s readers and boost your search engine rankings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples of “Now” Content vs “Evergreen” Content</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now Content: </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://digital-photography-school.com/get-excited-new-adobe-lightroom-cc/">Get Excited About the New Adobe Lightroom CC</a></span></p>
<p>Back in 2015 we published a post on Digital Photography School about Adobe’s new version of Lightroom – Lightroom CC. This is what I’d call “now” content. It was massive news in our community, as Lightroom is the most popular post-processing tool our readers use.</p>
<p>That post did really well for us. In the first week after it went life we had 12,000 page views. But then traffic tailed off. When I looked at the stats a year later, the post had just a handful of views – perhaps a thousand page views in that year. And most of those were in the second and third week after the post went live.</p>
<p>If your blog has mainly “now” content, you’ll probably see similar trends. You might be able to keep traffic coming in for a little while by re-sharing your post on social media a few times. But ultimately this type of content doesn’t attract much ongoing traffic.</p>
<p>Evergreen content looks very different.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evergreen Content: </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/">ISO Settings in Digital Photography</a></span></p>
<p>This post was an introduction to a photography concept called ISO. If you’ve got a film camera at home, you’ll remember that film used to have an ISO of a certain number. So this post explains what ISO means – and in particular what it means for digital photography today.</p>
<p>The day that post when live, DPS was a smaller blog. The post got 100 page views in the first week and then it tapered off to 40 or 50 visitors a day over the second and third week – a similar pattern to the traffic for the Lightroom post.</p>
<p>But then things began to grow.</p>
<p>A year after the post was published it was getting 200 to 300 post views per day.</p>
<p>Two years after it was published it was getting 700 page views per day.</p>
<p>Three years after it was published it was getting 1,000 page views per day.</p>
<p>Since then it’s been getting 1,000–1,500 views per day, although it can be as high as 10,000 views on days when I reshare it on Facebook.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Although I wrote that post in 2007, it continues to be valuable from my readers. </span>It gets traffic primarily from search engines, but also from social media when I (or our readers) share it. It’s also a post other people link to when they want to explain what ISO is, which continues to help it grow.</p>
<p>The Adobe Lightroom post and the ISO post both took no more than a couple of hours to write. But investing time and effort into the ISO post (the evergreen content) was worth much more than investing it into the Lightroom post (the “now” content).</p>
<p>That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with writing about today’s issues knowing those posts will date. We have posts like that on both DPS and ProBlogger. But we focus our attention mostly on evergreen content.</p>
<h2>More Examples of Evergreen Content</h2>
<p>Whenever I bring up evergreen content, some people say, “I just can’t do evergreen content on my blog”. These examples will give you a sense of the possibilities, and hopefully stimulate some ideas for you.</p>
<p>Once we’ve been through the examples, I’ll give you some tips on how to identify opportunities for evergreen content – even on blogs where it’s not obvious.</p>
<p>With these examples, I went through the top five posts on both ProBlogger and Digital Photograph School in terms of traffic.</p>
<h3>Example #1: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/10-ways-to-take-stunning-portraits/">Ten Ways to Take Stunning Portraits</a></span> (DPS)</h3>
<p>This post is typical of a lot of posts we have on Digital Photography School. It’s fairly introductory and focuses on portrait photography – probably the biggest category of posts we have on the blog.</p>
<p>It’s a longish post at about 1,400 words. I find search engines tend to like content that’s more than 1,000 words long.</p>
<p>The post has a list format. It covers ten points, and for each point I only really touch on the idea. I don’t go into great depth. But each one links to further reading, so hopefully readers will take a look at some of those, which increases the chances of them subscribing to the blog.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This post worked really well because it was an introductory post to a major category on the blog.</span> I’ve done the same thing with other categories: Landscape Photography, Macro Photography and Wedding Photography. These posts are all designed to be actional and practical, and to apply just as much ten years from now as they do today.</p>
<p>I also published a follow-up post to this one – <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://digital-photography-school.com/tips-portrait-photography/">Ten More Tips for Stunning Portrait Photography</a></span>. This drove traffic back to the first post, and when people link to that post they tend to link to the first one too.</p>
<p>The last reason this one worked well is because it was written in an accessible style. People like lists. And this post has lots of images so it’s easily scannable.</p>
<h3>Example #2: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/">Rule of Thirds</a></span> (DPS)</h3>
<p>This post is a bit different from the first example. It’s only 600 words long, and so it’s at the shorter end of posts we wrote on Digital Photography School. Evergreen content doesn’t have to be long form.</p>
<p>It’s not a “how to” post, either. Instead it’s a “what is” post that provides definitions. Many people will have come across the rule of thirds, which is a rule of composition. So while this post touches on how to apply the rule, it’s mostly about defining what the rule is.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In most niches, definition posts are a great way to create evergreen content. </span>We often use terms or phrases that someone new to the topic won’t understand.</p>
<p>Most readers coming to this post over the years have typed something like “<span style="font-style: italic;">what is the rule of thirds?” </span>into Google. We come up number one or two, depending on where Google’s ranking that post on a given day.</p>
<p>We do this type of post on ProBlogger as well. One piece we get a lot of traffic to is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/what-is-a-blog/">What is a Blog</a></span>? You might think that’s a silly post to write, but it’s amazing how many people type it into Google.</p>
<h3>Example #3: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/how-to-make-a-inexpensive-light-tent/">How to Make An Inexpensive Light Tent</a></span> (DPS)</h3>
<p>This post from Digital Photography School is about 1,100 words long.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> It’s a classic step-by-step post that teaches people how to do something, with lots of images along the way.</span></p>
<p>This one worked for a number of reasons. It’s a teaching post, and these step-by-step guides tend to work well. It’s also a post a lot of readers come back to. They might bookmark it to return to later.</p>
<p>It’s also the type of post that tends to get shared. Even now see people sharing this post on Twitter with friends. It seems to be a memorable post, and one that readers refer to again and again.</p>
<h3>Example #4: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/long-exposure-photography/">Long Exposure Photography: 15 Stunning Examples</a></span> (DPS)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I wanted to include this post because it’s only 200 words long (though the images do extend the length in some ways).</span> It’s built around 15 inspirational images that illustrate a particular photography technique.</p>
<p>Your evergreen content doesn’t have to be a teaching post. It could be a post made up mainly of images. If you choose the right images they can live on as something that inspires people for years to come.</p>
<p>You could also see this post as a bit of a case study that says, “Here’s what other people have done with this technique”.</p>
<h3>Example #5: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/21-sample-poses-photographing-female-models/">Posing Guide – 21 Sample Posts to Get You Started With Photographing Women</a></span> (DPS)</h3>
<p>This post is 900 words long, and again has lots of images – 21 of them. It was part of a series of evergreen content that worked well to build a large collection of linked posts. We had eight or nine posts in this series covering photographing women, men, couples, kids and different situations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is another example of words and images together. It’s not so much a teaching post, but more of a “how I did it” or case study post. </span>We also found that people often saved this post on their tablets or phones and take it with them when photographing women so they could show people the particular poses.</p>
<p>Creating a post that people will read more than once increases the evergreen nature of it, and the number of page views it will get.</p>
<h3>Example #6: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~www.problogger.net/can-you-really-make-money-blogging-7-things-i-know-about-making-money-from-blogging/">Can You Really Make Money Blogging [7 Things I Know About Making Money from Blogging]</a></span> (ProBlogger)</h3>
<p>This is one of the most read posts we’ve ever done on ProBlogger. It’s about 2,000 words, so it’s fairly long-form content. It’s an example of using a frequently asked question to create an evergreen piece. I saw a lot of people saying, “You can’t really make money blogging,” and so this was my answer to that.</p>
<p>It’s a list post, and the type of post I link back to from other posts on ProBlogger and mention on the podcast. Sending people to a post again and again increases the evergreen nature of it. Every time you get people to read one of your evergreen posts it increases the chances it will be shared or linked to, which helps your SEO.</p>
<p>It’s also a bit of a myth-busting post. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A myth in your industry that won’t go away is an ideal topic for an evergreen post.</span></p>
<h3>Example #7: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-money-with-the-amazon-affiliate-program/">The Ultimate Guide to Making Money with the Amazon Affiliate Program</a></span> (ProBlogger)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is a truly mega post at 7,700 words long. Because it’s so long, people tend to bookmark it for later.</span> They often save it to Facebook, which is a signal to Facebook that it ranks well. It’s been linked to from a lot of different blogs (including Amazon itself). And it’s a post I link back to from time to time.</p>
<p>A few of the techniques I mentioned in that post have dated slightly, and so I’ve updated it (something we’ll come to in a moment).</p>
<h3>Example #8: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/how-to-craft-a-blog-post-10-crucial-points-to-pause/">How to Craft a Blog Post – 10 Crucial Points to Pause</a></span> (ProBlogger)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This post was an introduction to a series of posts I published over several weeks.</span> It links to all the ten posts in the series. As I released each one I updated the introduction post to include the link, so it acted as a central hub for the rest of the series.</p>
<p>The ten things I mentioned in that post are as relevant today as they were back in 2008 when I published it. Not only has that post itself grown steadily in terms of traffic, it’s driven ongoing traffic to the ten posts in the series as well.</p>
<p>I link to this post from the portals around Problogger as well, so I’m sending traffic to it from the navigation areas on the blog rather than just relying on Google.</p>
<h3>Example #9: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~www.problogger.net/how-to-quit-your-job-move-to-paradise-and-get-paid-to-change-the-world/">How to Quit Your Job, Move to Paradise, and Get Paid to Change the World</a></span> (ProBlogger)</h3>
<p>This sounds like a bit of an aspirational post, and it is. It’s actually a guest post Jon Morrow wrote. I really recommend you go back and read it because it’s a story, which is another type of evergreen content. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you’ve got a great story to tell, it could work really well as a piece of content for your blog. </span></p>
<p>This post doesn’t date. It inspires people as much today as it did in 2011 when we first published it on ProBlogger.</p>
<h3>Example #10: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~www.problogger.net/10-david-ogilvy-quotes-that-could-revolutionize-your-blogging/">Ten David Ogilvy Quotes That Could Revolutionize Your Blogging</a></span> (ProBlogger)</h3>
<p>This post was a bit of a surprise to me. I didn’t realise it was still one of the most read posts on ProBlogger. Written in 2011, it’s just a collection of my favourite quotes from David Ogilvy, who’s like the original Ad Man.</p>
<p>It’s 1,500 words, so I did add in some of my own content.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> I guess people are still searching for quotes from David Ogilvy, which is where the traffic is coming from.</span></p>
<p>These are just ten examples of pieces of evergreen content that I’ve published on my blogs. If you want to take a look at some examples from other niches, here are some that ProBlogger readers have shared:</p>

<h2>What if it Seems Like Evergreen Content Won’t Work for You?</h2>
<p>At this point you might be thinking, “Evergreen content doesn’t really work for my niche”. I want to address that a bit.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evergreen content can take various forms.</span> The examples I’ve shared include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">“How to” posts</span> that give readers instructions on how to accomplish something.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Definition posts</span> that define a key term or principle related to your topic.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inspirational content</span> such as the image collections and Jon Morrow’s story.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advice posts</span> that make a recommendation or tell readers what they should do.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Swipe files or templates</span>, which are posts designed to be used again and again.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also different mediums you can use. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Evergreen content can be text, audio or video. You’re not limited to blog posts. </span></p>
<p>For example, many of my podcast episodes are as relevant today as when I recorded them. And my YouTube video on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9WEGOW2jjw">Secrets of Making Money Online</a></span> (which I published at the end of 2010) is still getting views today.</p>
<h2>Coming Up With Ideas for Evergreen Content</h2>
<p>So how do you find evergreen content ideas for your blog? Here are a few things to consider:</p>
<h3>#1: What Questions Do You Get Asked Today That You’ve Been Asked for Years?</h3>
<p>Are there any questions related to your topic that just don’t go away? With ProBlogger, a couple of these are “Can you really make money blogging?” and “How do you make money blogging?” Some of the best posts on ProBlogger just answer those types of questions.</p>
<h3>#2: What Key Challenges Do People Have?</h3>
<p>What challenges, obstacles or problems do people have related to your topic? On Problogger, one of these challenges is productivity. Readers want to know how to fit it all in and get it all done.</p>
<h3>#3: What Are Your Readers Searching For?</h3>
<p>You can also look at what people are searching for when they’re on your site, and what they’re searching for elsewhere about your topic. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://trends.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a></span> is a good tool for looking into this.</p>
<h3>#4: What “Cornerstones” Do People Need to Know?</h3>
<p>Back in 2007 I wrote a series of posts on Digital Photography School about aperture, shutter speed and ISO. I consider these three concepts to be cornerstone pieces of content. If you want to take a well-exposed photograph, you need to learn these three things.</p>
<p>Are there cornerstone things you constantly refer to on your blog? You might never have written a whole post about them because they seem so basic. But they can make great evergreen content, which you can then link back to any time you mention those concepts.</p>
<h3>#5: What Could You Create That People Will Keep Coming Back To?</h3>
<p>Is there something you could create that people would keep coming back to again and again? A good example is Carla and Emma’s post <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://themerrymakersisters.com/paleo-salted-choc-caramel-slice-recipe/">Paleo Salted Choc Caramel Slice Recipe</a></span>. It’s such an amazing slice (I’ve tasted it) that I bet people constantly come back to again and again.</p>
<p>Another way to create something people will keep returning to is to create a swipe file. Brian Clark wrote <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~www.copyblogger.com/10-sure-fire-headline-formulas-that-work/">Ten Sure-Fire Headline Formulas That Work</a></span> back in 2008 or 2009, and that post has become iconic. People constantly refer to it, and I constantly go back to it.</p>
<h3>#6: What Key Stories Could You Use from Your Life or Your Industry?</h3>
<p>What key stories have there been in your life or your industry that continue to have relevance today?</p>
<p>I think most of us have moments in our lives that have been turning points for us. Think about one of those key moments in your own life, and write a story about it for your blog.</p>
<h2>What if Your Content Dates Quickly?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, some blogs are all about “now” content. Perhaps they’re news blogs, a politics blog you run during election season, or a blog that’s all about new gadgets. That’s okay. But look out for opportunities to write some evergreen content as well to mix things up a little.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The mix of evergreen vs now content will vary from blog to blog. </span>Over on Digital Photography School, around 90 to 95% of what we publish is evergreen. We could write a lot more about new cameras coming out and new techniques for certain styles of post-processing, and we do a few of those types of things. But we generally leave that to other blogs.</p>
<p>On ProBlogger we have a bit more “now” content because techniques do change. In the past we’ve covered some emerging trends such as Snapchat and Facebook Live. Those posts are still reasonably evergreen, but maybe not so evergreen as some of the posts we do on Digital Photography School.</p>
<h2>Updating Your Evergreen Content</h2>
<p>Evergreen content is really a spectrum. Some pieces of content you write might still apply a hundred years from now. Others might be relevant for six months or so.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Of course, you can always update your content to make it more evergreen. </span>If you published a post a few years ago that has become dated, you can go back and make changes.</p>
<p>A good example of this is my <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/make-money-blogging/">Make Money Blogging</a></span> post. It’s about 2,900 words long, and I wrote it back in 2007 or 2008. Over the years I’ve updated and changed it. (You can see when it was last updated at the top of the post.) Probably very little of that original post now remains. I still consider it to be an evergreen piece of content because it’s still the same topic and the same URL. And it continues to rank well in Google.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you’ve got a post that’s doing well in Google, or one that gets a lot of traffic for another blog, make updating it a high priority.</span></p>
<p>Even on blogs that focus on now content such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.macrumors.com/">MacRumors</a></span>, it’s still possible to have evergreen content.</p>
<p>Most of the posts on MacRumors could become obsolete the next day if a rumor is disproved or a new product comes out.</p>
<p>But they do have some evergreen content, such as their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~buyersguide.macrumors.com/">buyer’s guide to all Apple products</a></span>. It gives you the latest information on each product, and they constantly update it. But it’s still an evergreen page because it fulfils a continual need from their readers: “Which product should I buy, and when?”</p>
<p>Another example of a post like this is Lifehacker’s post <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://lifehacker.com/lifehacker-pack-for-mac-our-list-of-the-essential-mac-635303836">The Essential Mac Apps for 2018</a></span>. If you look at that post you’ll see some of the comments are from 2013. It’s been live for a long time, but it’s updated regularly.</p>
<p>On Digital Photography School we have similar posts that list <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/the-19-most-popular-dslrs-among-our-readers/">our most popular Digital SLRs</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/30-popular-dslr-lenses-readers/">our most popular lenses</a></span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~digital-photography-school.com/popular-compact-system-mirrorless-cameras-readers/">our most popular compact cameras</a></span>. I update these posts three or four times a year to show the current trends in those particular things.</p>
<p>One final example is from my wife Vanessa’s blog, Style and Shenanigans. She wrote a post called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://styleandshenanigans.com/bali-where-to-shop/">Where to Shop in Bali</a></span> after we took a holiday there. It’s ranked pretty well in Google, and she updates it each time we go back to Bali.</p>
<h2>Getting Traffic to Your Evergreen Content</h2>
<p>Once you’ve written an evergreen piece of content, think how you’ll get readers to it. You want to aim for a steady stream of traffic over time.</p>
<p>Some things that will help are to:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#1: Optimise your post for SEO.</span> You can find some great tips on that in this podcast episode with Jim Stewart: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/5-mistakes-bloggers-make-with-seo-and-what-to-do-about-them/">What New (and Old) Bloggers Need to Know about SEO</a></span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#2: Highlight the post on your blog.</span> If it’s an important piece of content, you’ll want to link to it from key places like your navigation areas such as your menu or sidebar.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#3: Link to the post from older posts on your blog.</span> Go back through your archives and see if there are other relevant pieces of content you could link to your new evergreen content from. A trickle of traffic from ten different posts adds up over time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#4: Re-share that content on social media. </span>One simple thing I do pretty much every day is to go back and look at what I published on this day during previous years. If those posts are still relevant, I’ll reshare them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#5: Look for opportunities to link back to the post. </span>As you write new pieces of content, look out for opportunities to link back to your evergreen content. This doesn’t just apply to posts for your own blog. If you’re guest posting on someone else’s blog, don’t just link to your front page in your bio. Link to a piece of evergreen content.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#6: Consider contacting influencers who might be interested. </span>If there’s a social media influencer in your niche who might like and share that piece of content, send it their way. (For more on building relationships with influencers, check out <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/how-to-approach-influencers-in-your-niche/">How to Approach Influencers in Your Niche: Twelve Crucial Tips</a></span>.)</p>
<h2>What’s the Point of Your Evergreen Content?</h2>
<p>Finally, if you’re going to get a stream of steady traffic to your evergreen content then you’ll want to make the most of it. You don’t want visitors to read the content and then bounce straight off your site again.</p>
<p>To leverage that piece of content, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an email opt-in encouraging people to sign up for your email list.</li>
<li>Prompt people to read a second piece of content – some further reading.</li>
<li>Encourage them to follow you on social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s all about making sure your evergreen content is as “sticky” as possible. (For more on that, listen to Episode 35 of the podcast: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/turn-surfers-into-blog-readers-by-building-a-sticky-blog/">How to Turn Surfers into Blog Readers by Building a Sticky Blog</a></span>.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evergreen content is one of the best investments you’ll ever make in terms of creating content for your blog. </span>Of course, not every piece of content needs to be evergreen, and not every piece of evergreen content you create is going to work. But the more evergreen content you create over time the better.</p>
<p>Earlier in this post we took a look at ten pieces of content that have done really well for me on Digital Photography School and ProBlogger. Some of those pieces of content have had millions of views. But none of them have made up more than 1% or 2% of my overall traffic.</p>
<p>The reality is that most of the hundreds of millions of page views I’ve had over the years have come from all the little pieces of evergreen content.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evergreen content isn’t just about big posts that might go viral. It’s about all those little posts that might attract an extra ten, twenty, thirty visitors to your blog each month.</span> They all add up over time.</p>
<p>Every piece of content you create is an investment that continues to increase the amount of overall traffic to your blog.</p>
<p>This week, make it your goal to create some evergreen content and identify other topics you might want to write about that are evergreen in nature. Schedule it in over the coming weeks and months, and you’ll soon see the difference evergreen content can make.</p>

<p>You might think you’re on top of your blogging. You’re publishing posts regularly. You’re even active on social media.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But are you paying as much attention to your blog as you should be?</span></p>
<p>If you’re in a bit of a blogging rut (i.e. you’re producing and promoting new content but not much else) then you might be neglecting some other crucial aspects of your blog.</p>
<p>Here are seven warning signs your blog isn’t getting the attention it needs. And seven ways to turn things around.</p>
<h2>#1: Your Posts Aren’t Getting Any Comments or Responses</h2>
<p>When your blog is new, it’s normal to only get the occasional comment. But a sudden drop-off in comments (and other responses such as tweets, emails, “likes” on Facebook when you link to a new post, etc.) could be a warning sign.</p>
<h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
<p>A lack of comments (or responses in general) usually means your readers aren’t as engaged as they could be. And the problem can be self-perpetuating. If readers see there aren’t any comments on any of your recent posts, they may be reluctant to make the first comment.</p>
<p>Having no comments or engagement on your Facebook page can also be off-putting to new readers. It certainly doesn’t make your blog look like it’s thriving.</p>
<h3>How You Can Fix It</h3>
<p>In the short term, you could encourage more people to comment by specifically inviting them to at the end of posts. You could even ask a few blogging friends to stop by and leave a comment.</p>
<p>However, a lack of engagement usually means you need to look at your overall strategy. Are you writing posts that are genuinely useful to your readers? If not, what could you write that would truly resonate with them?</p>
<h2>#2: You Haven’t Sent Out an Email in Weeks (or Months)</h2>
<p>When did you last send anything to your email list? Many bloggers fail to send out emails, or have long gaps between emailing. (Assuming they <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/why-your-blog-needs-email-newsletter/">started an email list in the first place</a></span>.) Perhaps you’re waiting to promote a product you’re finishing off. Or maybe you’ve just been busy, and posting on your blog itself was all you could manage.</p>
<h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
<p>If you don’t have an email list at all then you’re missing out on a huge opportunity to engage with your readers and make more money from your blogging. Email tends to convert well into sales – usually much better than social media or search engine traffic.</p>
<p>If you <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> have a list, but don’t send out emails regularly, your list will go “cold”. People will forget who you are and why they signed up to hear from you. And if the first email they get after weeks or months is a sales email, they may well unsubscribe or even mark the email as spam.</p>
<h3>How You Can Fix It</h3>
<p>Get into the habit of sending something useful to your email list regularly. Some good options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A weekly or monthly newsletter sharing information that doesn’t appear on your blog</li>
<li>A weekly email with a short “teaser” plus a link to your weekly blog post(s)</li>
<li>An occasional series of emails you send out in the run-up to a product launch</li>
</ul>
<p>Schedule sending out a regular email (at least monthly) just as you’d schedule writing your blog posts.</p>
<h2>#3: Your Search Engine Traffic Has Dropped</h2>
<p>Is your search engine traffic slowly declining month by month? Or has there been a sudden drop in traffic for no clear reason?</p>
<p>If you’re not sure how much search engine traffic you’re getting, the best way to find out is by using Google Analytics. It’s great for tracking all sorts of data about the visitors coming to your site and how they’re using it.</p>
<h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
<p>If you don’t know your search engine traffic at all, you might need to pay closer attention to your blog’s stats. While there’s no need to <span style="font-style: italic;">obsess</span> over them, it’s well worth checking them regularly to stay on top of any problems.</p>
<p>With a healthy blog you’d normally expect a steady growth in total search engine traffic as you publish more posts each month (which creates more opportunities for readers to find your blog via search engines) and as your site gathers more backlinks.</p>
<h3>How You Can Fix It</h3>
<p>If your traffic has been slowly dropping off, it could be because you haven’t published many posts recently. Or maybe your blog has a lot of competition, and your competitors are now outranking you for some key search terms. It might help to look for your best-performing posts and see whether you can make them even better.</p>
<p>If your traffic has dropped sharply, there could be a technical issue with your site. Or your blog may have been penalised by Google. You can find out what’s happened by using the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a></span>.</p>
<h2>#4: You Can’t Remember When You Last Updated WordPress or Your Plugins</h2>
<p>If your blog is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/self-hosted-wordpress-alternatives/">hosted on WordPress.com</a></span>, the WordPress team will handle all the updates for you.</p>
<p>But if your blog is hosted on a site such as Bluehost or Hostgator then you need to ensure you’re keeping your version of WordPress and all your plugins up to date. (Some web hosts will update WordPress for you automatically, but you still need to keep an eye on things.)</p>
<p>If you can’t remember when you last updated anything, or know it was several months ago, that’s a problem. You can see how many updates are needed by looking at the red number next to “Updates” in the sidebar of your WordPress dashboard.</p>
<h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
<p>Outdated WordPress installations, themes, and plugins can pose a serious security risk to your blog. If there’s a security flaw in an old version of a plugin (or WordPress itself) and you don’t update it, your blog might get hacked.</p>
<p>Even without the security issues, you should always be running up-to-date versions of WordPress and your plugins so your blog functions at its best. Old plugins might not be fully compatible with newer WordPress installations, and so you need to keep them up to date to avoid issues with your blog.</p>
<h3>How You Can Fix It</h3>
<p>It’s always good to take a backup of your blog before updating WordPress or any plugins, just in case something goes wrong. (You can do this with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/7-best-wordpress-backup-plugins-compared-pros-and-cons/">a variety of different plugins</a></span>.) To check for available updates and apply them, go to the Updates page in your WordPress dashboard.</p>
<h2>#5. You Don’t Have An Editorial Plan or Content Calendar</h2>
<p>Do you just sit down and write whatever comes into your mind? Many bloggers do. They don’t have an editorial plan or a content calendar that allows them to plan for content that takes the reader on a journey.</p>
<p>This can be fine for some types of blogger. For instance, if your blog is essentially a personal diary it might work well for you. But for bloggers who want to make money or build a profile in their niche, not having a plan or calendar can really hold them back.</p>
<h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
<p>If you don’t plan ahead for the “big picture” of where your blog’s going, chances are it won’t really go anywhere. You might write posts week after week without really getting any traction.</p>
<p>You’ll probably run into other issues as well. What happens if you can’t think of a good idea one week? Do you write something that’s sub-par, or skip that week altogether? Neither is an ideal solution.</p>
<h3>How You Can Fix It</h3>
<p>Creating a simple content calendar doesn’t need to take long. You can simply grab a notebook and jot down ideas for the next month of blog posts. Alternatively, you could use a spreadsheet or a plugin such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-calendar/">Editorial Calendar</a></span>.</p>
<p>Think about how you can take your readers on a journey from where they are to where they want to be with your content. What questions could you answer? What obstacles could you help them overcome?</p>
<h2>#6. You’re Not Making As Much Money As Before</h2>
<p>Along with a gradual slowdown in traffic, some bloggers see a gradual slowdown in sales. Perhaps one of your products sold well a year or two ago, but since then sales have gradually dwindled to nothing. Or maybe the affiliate sales that gave you a nice extra income stream have dropped off, and now you don’t have much money coming in from your blog at all.</p>
<h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
<p>Obviously, if your goal is to make money from your blog then declining sales isn’t a good sign. Even if the slow down is gradual, a downward trend is a warning that something needs to change.</p>
<p>For busy bloggers, a drop in sales might not be immediately obvious. It may take months for you to realise you’re no longer selling as many ebooks as usual, or that a particular affiliate payout seems to have stopped. Just as you should keep an eye on your blog’s traffic, you should also keep a close eye on your income.</p>
<h3>How You Can Fix It</h3>
<p>Sales can drop for all sorts of reasons, and it’s worth trying to figure out what’s happened. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>While your new product may have sold well when you released it, most of your audience members who want it have now bought it. You might need to bring in fresh readers to reinvigorate sales.</li>
<li>Maybe the product you created several years ago was perfect for the market <span style="font-style: italic;">then</span>, but now looks pretty dated. It could be time to update or revamp it.</li>
<li>Perhaps you reviewed a bunch of affiliate products in the early days of your blog, but haven’t written any recent reviews, and so your affiliate income has dropped. Writing some new reviews (or updating and republishing older ones) could see your income recovering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#7: Your Readers Are Contacting You About Problems</h2>
<p>Have you had any emails or messages from readers recently alerting you to problems with your site?</p>
<p>Perhaps your contact form wasn’t working properly, or they couldn’t find the information they needed on your About page (which you hadn’t updated in years). Maybe something displayed strangely on their phone, or they couldn’t sign up to your newsletter. They may have even found a lot of broken links on your “recommended tools” page.</p>
<h3>Why It’s a Problem</h3>
<p>For every reader who contacts you about a problem, there were probably others who couldn’t find or do what they wanted and left your site, possibly forever.</p>
<p>Readers can be put off when they see obvious issues with your site (e.g. something isn’t displaying correctly, the information on your About page is out of date <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> your social media links don’t work properly). If your site looks neglected, they’re less likely to trust your content.</p>
<h3>How You Can Fix It</h3>
<p>As well as promptly addressing anything readers contact you about, it’s also worth regularly checking key pages and features of your site to ensure they’re working as you’d expect.</p>
<p>Every three to six months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your About page is up to date. Have any details changed?</li>
<li>Make sure your “Start Here” page or widget includes any really good new posts you’ve published.</li>
<li>Make sure your Contact form actually works correctly, and that the details are up to date.</li>
<li>Run through the checkout process for at least one of your products to make sure it’s working as you expected.</li>
<li>Sign up for your newsletter list to see how your Welcome email (and any subsequent emails) appears to a new subscriber.</li>
<li>Fix any broken links. The best way to do this is with a plugin like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/">Broken Link Checker</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be hard finding time to regularly write great content for your blog <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> maintain it. But if you only focus on writing posts and neglect everything else, you’ll struggle to see the success you want.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-use-quotes-in-your-blog-content-legally-and-ethically/">episode 173</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast.</span></p>
<p>Are you confident you’re using quotes legally and ethically on your blog?</p>
<p>Quoting other people’s words, whether from books or blog posts, can be a great way to improve the content on your blog. It’s also a great way to serve your readers (which we’ll dig into in a moment) and build relationships with those you’re quoting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">However, using other people’s content inappropriately can severely harm or even destroy your reputation as a blogger.</span> I’ve seen people’s profiles and credibility ripped to shreds because they haven’t done it right.</p>
<p>But don’t let that worry you. It’s easy to get this right. And that’s what we’ll be covering in this post.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">(Quick disclaimer: I’m not a lawyer, and this post isn’t legal advice. If you’re in doubt, seek the advice of a lawyer.)</span></p>
<h2>Should You Use Quotes at All?</h2>
<p>If using quotes can pose ethical (if not legal) issues, you might think the simplest solution is to avoid them altogether.</p>
<p>But quotes are really powerful, and you’re missing out if you’ve never used them.</p>
<p>Quoting someone else allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add more credibility to your articles </span>and make your arguments stronger. You’re showing you’re not the only person who thinks in a particular way about your topic.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make your posts more interesting and informative</span> for your readers by including insights and thoughts from other people.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn more yourself </span>by actively seeking out other people’s ideas.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">(Potentially) build connections with the people you quote.</span> Sometimes they’ll notice you’ve used their quote and thank you for quoting them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why You Need to Use Quotes Correctly</h2>
<p>Ethically, you should always give credit to those whose words and ideas you’re using. (You may also have a legal obligation to do so.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Never use someone else’s words and present them as your own. That’s plagiarism.</span></p>
<p>While some bloggers do it intentionally, others do it without really knowing what they’re doing.</p>
<p>But whether or not it’s intentional, doing it wrong can really harm your credibility and even create legal issues.</p>
<p>Here’s how to ensure you’re using other people’s words correctly:</p>
<h3>#1: Use Quotation Marks</h3>
<p>Always put quotation marks around someone else’s words (whether by typing the quotation marks or by using blockquote formatting). That makes it clear they’re not your words.</p>
<h3>#2: Name the Author</h3>
<p>Name the person you’re quoting, whether they’re someone contemporary (e.g. Mike Stelzner) or someone who’s long gone (e.g. Shakespeare).</p>
<h3>#3: Provide a Link Back, Where Possible</h3>
<p>If you can, link back to the exact content you took the words from. If they’re from a blog post, link to that blog post. If they’re from a podcast or a YouTube video, link to that.</p>
<p>If you can’t find the exact piece of content, or the quote is from something that doesn’t have a recording (e.g. a live speech ), find the person’s homepage or social media profile and link to that.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of key reasons why I suggest linking to the original piece of content:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It serves your readers. </span>They can go and look at the context of those words and see what else is said in that blog post/podcast/video.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It serves the person you’re quoting. </span>Hopefully it will drive some traffic and interest their way, and help them grow their profile and credibility. (This will also help you build your relationship with them.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Much Content Can You Quote?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I normally take only one to three sentences from someone else’s article.</span> If I want to use more, I ask permission from the blogger or podcaster first.</p>
<p>The general advice on this is to think about the proportion of the text you’re using. If you’re quoting from a book, it might be fine to quote 250 words (about a page). But if you’re quoting from a 1,000-word blog post, then about 50–70 words would be more appropriate. This is normally considered ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.janefriedman.com/permissions-and-fair-use/">fair use</a></span>’, and you don’t have to ask for permission.</p>
<p>Normally I err on the side of quoting less and encouraging readers to read the whole article.</p>
<h3>What if You Need to Modify the Quote?</h3>
<p>When you’re quoting someone, you may need to add a few words to give readers more context, or take out a few words to shorten the quote.</p>
<p>If you do this, it’s important to be clear about what you’ve modified.</p>
<p>If I’m adding to a quote, I always put what I’ve added in square brackets; if I’m removing something from a quote, I use three dots (with spaces between each one) to show where I’ve omitted text.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples (from above):</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding words for context and clarity:
<br>
</span>
<br>
“If I want to use more [than a few sentences], I ask permission from the blogger or podcaster first.” (Darren Rowse, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">How to Use Quotes in Your Blog Content Legally and Ethically</span>)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Removing words to make a quote more succinct:</span></p>
<p>“If you can, link back to the exact content you took the words from. . . .  If you can’t find the exact piece of content . . . find the person’s homepage or social media profile and link to that.” (Darren Rowse, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">How to Use Quotes in Your Blog Content Legally and Ethically</span>)</p>
<h2>Tips for Using Other People’s Words and Ideas in Your Blog Posts</h2>
<h3>#1: Add Your Own Thoughts to a Quote</h3>
<p>Don’t just take a quote and put it up as a blog post. While it’s legally and ethically fine (as long as you link it back to the person), it would serve your readers better if you wrote a bit about why you chose that quote.</p>
<p>That could mean an introductory paragraph about why you chose it, and a paragraph or two at the end where you say what you’d add to the quote or how you’d qualify it. You could even tell a story that illustrates the point of the quote.</p>
<h3>#2: Give Credit to People for Their Ideas, Not Just Their Quotes</h3>
<p>Even if you’re not quoting someone’s exact words, it’s good form (and wise from a legal perspective) to credit them for inspiring what you’ve written.</p>
<p>Back in 200, I watched a video presentation from Chris Brogan, who was doing a lot of thinking back them on blogging and social media. In the video he talked about using his blog as a “home base” and his social media as “outposts” around it, and had a description and a diagram to illustrate this.</p>
<p>I loved his idea, and it gave me the language to explain how I also use social media.</p>
<p>While I’ve never directly quoted Chris, I’ve often used the idea of a “home base” and “outposts” in our posts. When I talk about it – on the blog, on webinars, or in keynotes – I always say, “I got this from Chris Brogan”.</p>
<h3>#3: Give Credit to the Source of Your Quotes</h3>
<p>Sometimes you find a quote through someone else. For instance, if Chris Brogan blogged about something Mike Stelzner said, I might use Mike’s quote but add that I found it via Chris Brogan. And I’d link to Chris’s post as well as Mike’s.</p>
<p>This isn’t a legal requirement as far as I know. But I think it’s good form, and it helps build credibility. It also adds extra value for your readers because it gives them two other posts to read that offer different contexts and viewpoints.</p>
<p>For lots of different ways to use quotes on your blog (such as putting together lists or creating an expert roundup), check out Ali Luke’s post, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/the-why-how-and-when-of-using-quotations-on-your-blog/">The Why, How and When of Using Quotations on Your Blog</a></span>.</p>
<h2>Using Other People’s Images on Your Blog</h2>
<p>Using images is trickier than using quotes, because when you use an image  you’re using the <span style="font-style: italic;">entire </span>piece of work.</p>
<p>To do this you should either get explicit permission from its creator or choose an image that’s already been licensed for you to use. For instance, it could be licensed with a creative commons license, or you might have purchased it from a stock photography site.</p>
<p>For more about using images legally and ethically, check out my post, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/legal-blog-images/">How to Find Images for Your Blog That Won’t Get You Sued</a></span>.</p>
<h2>Using Other People’s Videos on Your Blog</h2>
<p>If you find a video on YouTube you want to use, check whether there’s an embed code. (The video creator can allow or disallow embedding.) If you can see the embed code, consider it as permission to use the video.</p>
<p>But again, you should always credit the video and never present it as your own in any way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Whenever you’re using someone else’s ideas or words, make it really clear to your readers they aren’t </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">your</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ideas or words. </span>It’s an ethical and legal obligation. And it will help you serve your readers well.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: Hey there, friends. It&#8217;s Darren Rowse from ProBlogger. Welcome to Episode 278 of the ProBlogger Podcast. The podcast is designed to help you start a blog, to build that blog, and to monetize it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, I&#8217;ve got a special treat for you. It is a keynote that I gave a couple of years ago at our ProBlogger event in Melbourne. It&#8217;s titled Evolve Don&#8217;t Revolve. It&#8217;s all about how as bloggers and online entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s really easy to revolve in our blogging, to just go around in circles. I don&#8217;t know if you can relate to that of feeling going around in circles. I certainly can. There&#8217;s been so many times over my 15 years of blogging where I&#8217;ve realized I&#8217;m just treading water, I stopped growing, I stopped evolving. The call of this keynote is to look at seven different areas where you can evolve your blog and online business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, a taster of what we do at our Evolve event, at our ProBlogger event, which we&#8217;ve been running it for quite a few years. We&#8217;ve got our new event coming up in August of this year on the 10th and 11th of August, again, in Melbourne. I want to tell you a little bit about that event before we get into the keynote. There&#8217;s two options for those of you who want to come to our event in Melbourne. On the 10th of August, we&#8217;ve got a training day. This is a one day event for beginners, intermediate level bloggers. It&#8217;s also probably relevant for other content creators as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you head to problogger.com/events you can actually see a rundown of what we&#8217;re doing at that particular event. Largely though, it&#8217;s me. You&#8217;ll get a full day of me teaching on the four key areas of building a successful blog. I&#8217;m going to talk for about an hour about content and crafting great content for your blog. I&#8217;ll talk about evolving your engagement with your readers, how to build community on your blog, how to find new readers for your blog, and then, how to monetize your blog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is perfect if you are a beginner or intermediate level. If you&#8217;re just starting out, you just set up your blog, maybe with our Start a Blog course, this is brilliant to help you get the ball rolling. If you&#8217;re more intermediate, maybe you&#8217;ve been blogging for a while, you want to evolve what you&#8217;re doing, maybe from a hobby blog to a professional blog where you make money from it, or maybe you&#8217;ve had a blog that&#8217;s going a little bit dormant, a little bit stagnant, and you want to give it a refresh, then this is the perfect event for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You will also, in that event, hear from Jeff Goins, who we&#8217;re bringing out from Nashville, Tennessee in the States. He&#8217;s going to come out and do the keynote on finding your voice as a blogger. He&#8217; brilliant on that particular topic and a really great teacher when it comes to writing and communicating on a blog. You&#8217;ll also hear a little bit from Nicole Avery at the end of that day as well. She&#8217;ll talk about productivity and really help you shape what you&#8217;re going to do as a result of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other option for those of you who are a little bit more intermediate and advanced is to come along to our mastermind. This is the second time we&#8217;ve held masterminds at our ProBlogger event. It&#8217;s being held this time over two days, the 10th and the 11th of August, again, in Melbourne. We&#8217;ll actually overlap with our training day. You&#8217;ll hear the same keynote from Jeff Goins at the start of the day. The rest of the two days, you&#8217;ll hear from some other people including James Schramko, who is a Sydney-based content creator and business owner. He&#8217;s brilliant on selling and helping you to grow a business. He&#8217;s brilliant on membership sites and just a really smart guy. You also get to sit around the table with Jeff and James in masterminding, myself as well on the second day. Nicole is there as well. We&#8217;ve also got Kelly Exeter, who&#8217;s brilliant on writing, editing, also design, self-publishing. And Shayne Tilley from 99Designs, who&#8217;s spoken at all of our events. He&#8217;s brilliant on creating products via blog marketing and just really helping you to shape your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You get the opportunity at the mastermind to sit with all of those people and also other attendees. This is where the real value comes when you sit with other bloggers, online creators, entrepreneurs, and spend a couple of days really workshoping your business. If you like to get to our event on the 10th and 11th of August this year, just head over to problogger.com/events. You can see all the details there. We do currently have an early bird offer and that ends at the end of June. You don&#8217;t have long to grab your tickets at that special rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All right, I&#8217;m going to get into today&#8217;s keynote. You&#8217;ll also, at the end of this keynote, hear from a familiar voice to many of you, from Pat Flynn. Pat was at our event. We fly out at least one international guest every year. This year it&#8217;s Jeff Goins, but Pat was at our event two years ago. I interviewed Pat on stage and there&#8217;s a bit of Q&amp;A with our audience as well. As we talk particularly, again, about him and how he&#8217;s evolved his blog. Pat is just a brilliant example of someone who has done that brilliantly over the years. What he&#8217;s doing today is very different to what he started out doing. I think that&#8217;s the reason that he has had so much success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, settle in, maybe grab yourself a beverage or something to eat because this goes for about an hour, a bit over an hour. You might even want to break it down into two sessions; that&#8217;s totally fine as well. There&#8217;s lots of practical stuff in this. If you also want to checkout the slides, head over today to our show notes at problogger.com/podcast/278 where you&#8217;ll be able to get the slides. There are a few things in this talk where I do refer to stuff that&#8217;s on the screen including a few jokes and funny bits as well. Hope you enjoy this keynote. Then, I&#8217;ll come back at the end just to wrap things up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was interviewed on a radio just recently. Someone asked me that same question but they asked me to go back to the very start of my blog and said, &#8220;What has changed in your blogging since you started?&#8221; Now, I started blogging in 2002. It was a mind-blowing question to be asked because everything has changed in my blogging since 2002 except for the fact that a blog is pretty much the same thing. It&#8217;s chronologically organized information, it&#8217;s got comments usually, and it&#8217;s content, it&#8217;s useful content. That&#8217;s always been my philosophy. Fifteen years of blogging, things have changed a lot for me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the first article anyone ever wrote about me. It was written in 2006. I found it the other day as a screenshot. When I read the article, I realized things have changed but also the picture. Hopefully, I looked a little less stressed than I did back then. I don&#8217;t know what it was but this photographer just seemed obsessed with me putting my hands in my head. These are the pictures he took that day. I thought I was maybe looking seriously or maybe wanted to cover up the fact that I was bald.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, things have changed for me. I now have a pose slightly differently for photos that&#8217;s partly because I&#8217;ve got an Instagram-obsessed wife and she knows you’ve got to [&#8230;] this kind of stuff. Things have changed a lot and I look back on those times and think things have changed for me a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is my first blogpost. When I first published it, I didn&#8217;t look like this. I&#8217;ve started on Blogspot which became Blogger and my first theme was a free theme. There was hardly six to choose from, and it was navy blue, black, and monochrome. It was the most ugly thing that you&#8217;ve ever seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, this is my first attempt at a blog design. It&#8217;s pretty much the only time I’ve ever attempted a blog design and I realized very quickly that even after three weeks of work to get to this point that I wasn&#8217;t really very good at it. Even if you look at that post, you&#8217;ll see things have changed. I used tiny little fonts. It was peaches at all on any post that I wrote. The tools that I was using, Blogger, they were very basic. You couldn&#8217;t even have comments on Blogger when I first started. You had to install a script. There&#8217;s lots of things have changed since 2002.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next question I was asked in the interview when I recapped some of these things was, &#8220;How did you make the change from where you were then to where you are now?&#8221; This is the most impossible question I&#8217;ve been asked because I knew that the interview only had three minutes to go. &#8220;How did you do it? How do you transition from those awkward starts that we all start with to a point where you have a business around your blog or you&#8217;re a full-time blogger, or whatever it is that is your goal?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I completely stuffed up my answer. I&#8217;ve been stressing about how I answered that on the radio that day and I&#8217;ve been thinking about how I should&#8217;ve responded. If I have 45 minutes to answer, I probably would&#8217;ve told you what I&#8217;m about to tell you. That&#8217;s what I want to really just give my proper answer today, how do you change from those awkward starts to building a business to realizing your goals of blogging?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing I wished I said was that persistence is really 90% of it. That&#8217;s not the sexiest answer. It&#8217;s not a strategic answer, but it&#8217;s true. I love this quote from Albert Einstein, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m so smart, it&#8217;s just that I’ve stuck with problems longer.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s probably a bit of false modesty in that from Albert Einstein, saying he&#8217;s not that smart, but I really relate to that. I look around this room and I know I&#8217;m not the best writer in this room. I&#8217;m not the best writer out there. I&#8217;m not the best marketer. I&#8217;m not the best at technology. I&#8217;m certainly not the best blog designer. I’m not the best at anything, but I really stuck at it for a long time and I think persistence has really paid off for me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love the story of the turquoise and the hare or the turtle and the hare. You&#8217;re going to see a few turtles today because I really relate to that turtle. Taking one small step after another. Keeping the momentum going is just so important. Really, I think 90% of any success I had has come from persistence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can you persist with? I&#8217;ve shared this quite a few times now in this event. Success is usually more about doing the things that you know you should be doing rather than trying to find the secret strategies, the secret sauce all the time. I say this at the front of this event because a lot of our new attendees often come going, &#8220;What&#8217;s the real secret? How are we really going to do this?&#8221; and they’re looking for that thing that&#8217;s just going to escalate things for them. Some of the strategies that you hear will escalate you forward. But really, what is going to grow you the most is doing the things you already know you should be doing and they’re the things that you probably knew when you first started your blog already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We call these Pillars of ProBlogging and you may have heard us talking about these before. Chris Garrett, who wrote the ProBlogger book with me, came up with this in 2009. We actually based the first event on these four pillars and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing again today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first one is content. On day one, when I wrote that first blog post, I knew that I needed to write content. We all do. This is just no brainer stuff. You look at that first blog that you set up and you see there&#8217;s no post. Instinctively, you need to create content for it unless it&#8217;s not really a blog. For me, this is obviously the key to it. Every post you write is building the asset of your blog. Every useful piece of content that you write, it&#8217;s the archives that really is the value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of bloggers do look for that viral piece of content. They just want to write one piece of content that&#8217;s going to escalate them. Occasionally, those viral pieces of content do come and they do escalate you forward. But really, it&#8217;s persisting with your content. This is one of those things you already know that you should be doing but you need to persist with it. That&#8217;s so important to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second pillar is community. It&#8217;s engagement. It&#8217;s about interaction. The way we&#8217;ve been in 2002 is changing. Previous to 2000, I reckon that most people went online trying to download stuff. A lot of it is dodgy. They were satisfied to go online and get stuff, receive stuff, download stuff. That&#8217;s what I used to do. I used to go online and research the essays I was writing. I was studying at that time. I was downloading stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around 2000, and even before, but really started to escalate 2000–2002, people realized that they could interact more. The web became a much more interactive space and this is the beginnings of social media. I probably started with user boards, internet chats, and some of these older technologies, but blogging really escalated this. This is the reason I started blogging was I saw it was an interactive medium and I saw that people were really engaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day I installed comments on my first blog, it took me about a week to do it. I saw my blog improving incredibly. As I improved the content I was writing, it&#8217;s that engagement. People sharing their stories, sharing their experience, disagreeing, and encouraging, those types of things have really improved the content that I was creating. I realized that my blog grew faster the more engaging it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Community is so important, but the thing about community is that it doesn&#8217;t just happen in one day. It takes time and it takes persistence. Every time you respond to a comment, every time you respond to an email, every time you engage with someone on social media, you&#8217;re building the asset of your blog. It&#8217;s persistence with community and engagement that is so important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Number three pillar is traffic. Remember that first day where you realized you&#8217;ve written a piece of content and no one is reading it except for you? That feeling sometimes last for some of us for weeks. Then, someone shows up on you reblog and you realize, someone found your blog. I remember that moment very clearly. I published my first post and then, my next feeling was, &#8220;How am I going to get people to read the post?&#8221; I did what almost every blogger does. I spammed all my friends and said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my blog.&#8221; That&#8217;s how most of us start. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of us realize that we can&#8217;t really sustain that approach for too long. Our friends are only going to put out with those emails for the first few days. But we&#8217;ve learnt something on that first day. We&#8217;ve learnt that we need to take responsibility for driving traffic to our blog. It&#8217;s something that we need to take initiative to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We all have these dreams that if we just write good enough content, floods of traffic is going to come to us. But in the early days of our blog, particularly, we need to take the initiative. We need to take steps to drive traffic and that really shouldn&#8217;t go away. We should always be thinking, &#8220;How am I doing to drive traffic to my blog? Where can I be engaging? Where can I be useful? Where can I build my profile and drive some traffic back to my blog?&#8221; This is something we need to persist with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, in time, word of mouth does kick in. Our readers begin to spread the word for us. But even today, 15years later, I&#8217;m still asking myself, &#8220;How can I get traffic to my blog?&#8221; In fact, just two days ago, I said to my team, &#8220;We really need to up our game in this area,&#8221; because we&#8217;ve noticed our traffic&#8217;s sliding from some of our old steady sources of traffic like Facebook. The Facebook algorithm is killing us all. At the moment, we need to be more proactive with that. We need to take some more initiative on that front. Traffic is the third pillar. This is all the stuff that we all know on the first day of our blog. We know we need content, engagement, and traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fourth pillar is another thing. If we want a profitable blog, we need to be proactive in the area of monetization. For me, this really didn&#8217;t even kick in for a year-and-a-half because I didn&#8217;t know that you could monetize a blog back in 2002; no one was really doing it. But again, I learned very quickly that even though I dreamt of a passive income straight from my blog, that I needed to do some work to get that passive income stream going in the early days. This is another area we need to persist with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this is a common theme at a ProBlogger event. If you&#8217;ve been to our events before, you know I talk a lot about putting time aside to monetize your blog. I think it was about four years ago. I put a challenge to our community and said, &#8220;Put aside 15 minutes everyday to monetize your blog in some way.&#8221; If we all put aside time to write content, we put aside time to engage with our audience, we put aside time to promote our blog, but most of us don&#8217;t put aside time on a regular daily basis to monetize our blog, at least a lot of bloggers don&#8217;t. Four years ago, I put that challenge out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember, a lot of bloggers took up that challenge. Twelve months later at the next event, I was amazed at how many bloggers came up to me and said, &#8220;You know, I took the 15-minute challenge and I wrote a book this year. I wrote a book I&#8217;ve never have written. I wrote [&#8230;] guide, launched a course. I launched a membership site.&#8221; I can see people in the room who actually came up to me and said, &#8220;That 15 minutes a day challenge changed my blog.&#8221; To me, it was really a great illustration of how persistence in this pillar pays off. I think this is probably one of the biggest messages I want to get across to new users. If you want a profitable blog, you need to take some initiative in this, no matter what model you used. Persistence in this area is so important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Persist with content, engagement, traffic, monetization. It&#8217;s the accumulation of the little steps that you take in these areas that&#8217;s really is going to put you in the best position for a profitable blog. It&#8217;s not the secret strategies. It&#8217;s these four things. That&#8217;s why we designed today around these four things. We want you to persist in these areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here&#8217;s a question for you, which of these four things your weakest link? Which one is the weak one for you at the moment? Where have you been putting all your energy? That’s great that you&#8217;ve been putting your energy there but where, maybe, have you been taking the foot of the accelerator this year?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, every year, it&#8217;s been different. Every year, I realize that there&#8217;s been times where I really haven&#8217;t put much time into my content. Or there&#8217;s been times where I really just not serve my readers and engage with them as much as I could&#8217;ve. Or like this year, maybe I got a little bit lax at driving traffic, maybe I&#8217;ve been focusing on other things, or maybe it&#8217;s been monetization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are times in your blog’s life cycle where you probably do need to focus more on one thing. There are other times where you need to just ask yourself again, &#8220;Where have I been missing out?&#8221; That&#8217;s one of the quickie questions I would ask you to ponder today as you think about your next steps with your blog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Persist. Persisting is so important but it&#8217;s not enough. Often, I hear business quotes. There&#8217;s a lot of quotes about persisting. Sometimes it sounds like all you have to do is persist. Actually, it&#8217;s not. Persisting is really important but there&#8217;s something else that I think is just so important. We&#8217;ve actually chosen six speakers to speak to you today. Tomorrow, Shane is coming tomorrow for the mastermind. We’ve chosen people who I believe have persisted but they&#8217;ve done this other thing as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been talking about the tortoise. I actually felt really sorry for the hare growing up. I don&#8217;t know whether you did but I use to think that the hare had wasted potential. He had some qualities that had he just applied it to himself a little bit more or perhaps haven’t been so destructive, maybe he could have been a good thing. I am an empathetic kid. I was an empathetic kid. I looked for how could the hare have won the race. I actually think that there were some things that we could learn from the hare that our speakers have as a quality as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I look at that first blog, I can see things have changed. I didn&#8217;t just persist to get my blogs to the point that I am today. You can see that things have changed. If I have just persisted on this blog design, I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve got here. If I hadn&#8217;t persisted with tiny fonts like I did back then, I wouldn&#8217;t have got there. If I haven&#8217;t persisted with just written content, no visual content, I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve gotten where I am today. Things changed and I think the lesson that we can learn from the hare is that they&#8217;re quick to change direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Has anyone ever tried to catch a rabbit in the wild? That&#8217;s very hard to do. It can be a little bit cruel if you do it the right way. My parents actually lived on farms for a long time. I spent a lot of time chasing all kinds of animals on those farms including rabbits and I never caught one. It wasn&#8217;t that they were just fast. It was just that they had the ability to change directions and they&#8217;re very nimble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love this quote from Richard Branson. &#8220;Every success story is a tale of constant adaptation, revision, and change,&#8221; and that&#8217;s certainly been the story for me. Evolution is really important; evolving. That&#8217;s why we call this event Evolve because persistency isn&#8217;t enough. We need to evolve what we do. Persist in those pillars but evolve what we do in those pillars as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is evolving so important? It&#8217;s because everything around us right now is evolving. Has anyone noticed the space we’re engaging? It&#8217;s just changing. We could run an event every month and still not keep up with the trends in blogging and the [&#8230;] space at the moment. It is changing so very fast. The challenges in front of us as bloggers at the moment, just changing all the time, and as a result we need to evolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the massive challenges that faces us at the moment is noise. Is anyone struggling with noise at the moment? There&#8217;s so much content being produced in all of the niches that we&#8217;re in. There&#8217;s tens of millions of blogs producing hundreds and millions of pieces of content. There so many different platforms now. When I started blogging, there wasn&#8217;t really many ways to create content. Now, we can do it on YouTube, on Instagram, and all these social networks. There&#8217;s different platforms in blogging, all these places producing noise. We’ve got mainstream media producing amazing amounts of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Washington Post is publishing over a thousand articles a week. Some of those articles have been written by computers now. You can&#8217;t even tell the difference between the computer-written content and the human-written content. That&#8217;s just going to get escalated more and more. We&#8217;re seeing the rising bots and messenger bots. This is all the more noise and more content. We&#8217;re seeing the automation of repurposing of content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was talking to one blogger earlier this year about the noise and she said, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m making a lot of it myself.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why? Why do you say?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I write three blog posts a week.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s certainly not much noise. You&#8217;re not really contributing.&#8221; She said, &#8220;No, you don’t understand. That&#8217;s just three posts a week. Then, this is what I do to promote those posts.&#8221; She created this checklist. I was proud of her but I was also like, &#8220;It’s your fault,&#8221; at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what she does for every blog post. She emails her readers twice in the first month. She puts it on Facebook, on her page twice in the first month. She puts it in the Facebook group twice in the first month. She puts it on Twitter 15 times in the first month. Then, it goes into a less frequent cycle. Then, she puts it on Pinterest in her own boards—she&#8217;s got several—and other people&#8217;s boards where she&#8217;s a group member. She puts it on her LinkedIn profile, her LinkedIn page, her LinkedIn group, in Instagram as a photo, video, and a story. Then, she puts it on Snapchats. I stumbled upon Google+ on her profile and a page in her Reddit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she starts pitching other people to write more content for them that promotes her post and her goal is to write two guest post to promote her post on her blog for every post she writes. Then, she pitches influencers on different social networks. She repurposes all of her post into SlideShares and then turns them into YouTube. She creates Medium and LinkedIn post audio for SoundCloud, puts them on Facebook live. Then, she does visual graphics for all of these posts. She does a PDF version of her post which she uses as an opt-in. Then, she starts advertising it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She does over 50 pieces of content. Some of them micro content but 50 for every post that she does. This is happening more and more. Many of you in the room, maybe you don&#8217;t have quite as advanced system as she does, but a lot of us do. If we think about it, the amount of [&#8230;] time that we spent promoting our content, this is happening more and more. Mainstream media are even better at doing it than we are. This is contributing to the noise. As a result of these massive challenges facing us at the moment, how do we stand out amidst this noise? We need to evolve our approach. We need to evolve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another massive challenge for us at the moment is distribution. It used to be that someone will come to my blog and go, “I want more of his content. I&#8217;m going to follow him on Facebook.” Then, I would see every post that I did. Although, I would say, &#8220;I want all of these. I&#8217;m going to get his email. I&#8217;m going to subscribe to his emails or I would subscribe to his RSS feed. It used to be very neat like these yellow pipes. They want the content, they get the content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It all changed. It has become a mess. This is again, one of the biggest challenges facing us at the moment is that people want to have content but doesn&#8217;t see our content for a variety of reasons. They&#8217;re scattered in different places. The algorithms are filtering our content in social networks. Also, our emails now are being put in folders that people never open. We&#8217;re seeing a rise in pay-to-play. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of our audience now becoming blind to the techniques that we use in marketing. It used to be that I just didn’t see the banner ads, but now I don&#8217;t think that’s a opt-in as much. They don&#8217;t see our emails as much because they don&#8217;t want that. They&#8217;re distracted a lot now, partly because of the noise as well. This is another challenge we need to evolve. We need to evolve if we want our messages to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now these are negative things. The noise and the distribution challenges are negative, and I don&#8217;t want to depress you too much. There&#8217;s also some positive reasons we need to evolve as well. One of the positive reasons is that there&#8217;s these incredible opportunities facing us at the moment. The tools of that before us, the technologies that are opening up at the moment are amazing. It&#8217;s like no other time in history. The demand in video is a real opportunity. The demand for live video and the tools that are right in our fingertips, that enable us to go live on social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if you listen to my podcast but recently I talked about a tool called Ecamm Live. It&#8217;s US$30 and it puts a TV studio on your computer. It enables you to have multi cameras, do overlays, share your screen, do these amazing things live in front of people, and interact with people. The tools are quite amazing. It&#8217;s an incredible opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Australia, over the last six or so months, I&#8217;ve seen this rise in interest in podcasting. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve noticed it, my family and friends are now on podcasting, listening to podcast like I&#8217;ve never seen before. Vanessa, I reckon, she can choose four or five hours of podcast a day. She just constantly listening. I&#8217;m seeing my family and friends doing this. It&#8217;s really on the rise in Australia. It&#8217;s an opportunity before us at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We&#8217;re seeing the emergence of messaging bots which is something I think is escalating at the moment. There&#8217;s opportunities there. I&#8217;m seeing the growth in Facebook groups. We&#8217;re seeing a growth in all these tools that enable us to market in a more personal way as well. It&#8217;s incredible opportunities if only we are able to evolve fast enough to take them. Some of these opportunities come and go very quickly, so we need to be nimble. We need to be like the hare, being able to change directions while we also persist as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Persist and evolve. I actually start to think this way about the evolution of my blogs. This is the evolution of Digital Photography School which is my main blog since 2002. I did this because it&#8217;s actually been a tough week for me, for our company as well, and for my family. We had a death in the family this week. My father-in-law passed away yesterday. It&#8217;s been a tough time on that front. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, it&#8217;s been a tough time in our company because one of our key staff members who many of you know, resigned three weeks ago. Jasmine. Does anyone know Jasmine? Jasmine used to direct this event. It was really sad to see her go but also exciting to see her opportunities. One of the things I started to do after she resigned was to think about the evolution since she joined my company. I actually did a little bit of a timeline on how she&#8217;s been involved in changing our company. I wanted to show her what&#8217;s she done for our company. This started as the last seven years since Jasmine coming on board, then I went back earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to show you this because it&#8217;s been constant evolution, the Digital Photography School. It really has and it started even before Digital Photography School started. It started back in 2002 when I started blogging at all.  I just wanted to point out, to finish off my talk, some of the evolutions that have taken place in the last 15 years. I&#8217;ve chosen things that I think are really relevant for bloggers of different stages for you. Bear with me as I reflect on the last 15 years. It all, as I said, started in 2002 when I started blogging. I&#8217;m not going to retell that story because I&#8217;ve told it many times before. The one thing I do want to say is that I didn&#8217;t procrastinate. This is one of the only times I didn&#8217;t procrastinate in my life, pretty much, and in my business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone shot me a link to a blog and within an hour or so, seeing what a blog was for the first time, I started my own. I don&#8217;t really know why I didn&#8217;t procrastinate. I probably should&#8217;ve. I had a lot of reasons why I shouldn&#8217;t have started a blog back then, but I didn&#8217;t procrastinate. I started that blog and I&#8217;m so glad that I started quickly because this is one of the biggest stumbling blocks that I see happening is that people try to get their blog perfect before they launched it. I&#8217;m so glad that I didn&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see that some of you are nodding to each other right now and you can relate to this. We get analysis paralysis. What I&#8217;ve learned about getting a perfect blog—there&#8217;s no such thing—any kind of ideal, perfect, blog comes through evolution. It comes through starting and realizing it&#8217;s not perfect, then fixing the mistakes. Then watching how people respond to that and then moving forward in that regard. You need to start. It just need to start. If you&#8217;re at that point where you&#8217;ve been procrastinating on starting your blog, please get it done. You’re more than welcome to come to this event if you haven&#8217;t started a blog, but if you come back next year and haven&#8217;t started, I&#8217;m going to chase you down. So start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next most obvious thing from an external point of view about the evolution of Digital Photography School is that it&#8217;s changed its design. I&#8217;ll talk a little bit about that. This is the first design of Digital Photography School. This is the second time I tried to design a blog; really not very good. Actually, it was free template and this is what I started. This is what many bloggers do. We start with the free templates. I&#8217;ve been blogging for four or five years by this point. I didn&#8217;t really have an excuse to start with the free template, but I did and I’m tired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Very quickly, I decided that once I got some runs on the boards, want some readers done [&#8230;] I decided I was going to change the design. So then, I moved to a premium template where I paid $40 for it. Then, I paid someone $100 to design a logo, so it&#8217;s slightly more customized. Then, I decided to bite the bullet and get someone to design a proper blog design for me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had sliders. Do you remember that time when sliders became the big thing? They&#8217;re still the big thing for some bloggers but we added the slider in. Then we changed colors back to some of our roots. We changed the slider a little bit more and it became even more like a magazine. This is our current design. Then, we went for a responsive design. If you haven&#8217;t gone responsive, if you haven&#8217;t designed for mobile, I really encourage you to do that because it really helped our blog a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, we&#8217;re working on our next design. This is just a very early concept that we&#8217;re working on for the next one. This is something every two years now, we&#8217;re trying to redesign our blog just to bring freshness to it. A lot of it is really now about trying to keep up with the technology. Google really wanting you to be mobile responsive. There&#8217;s really good reasons for a good blog design as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is another area. Maybe you&#8217;ve come today. Maybe it&#8217;s time for your next blogs on this. People in this room are really good on that. So, ask questions around. Who designed your blog? What have you found work well for you? Look at each other&#8217;s blog on mobile, show each other what&#8217;s work well. I really encourage you to evolve in this particular area.  The thing we&#8217;ve been doing more recently with our design is not just a complete redesign but an evolution. We’re trying to change bit by bit and testing along the way. I think that&#8217;s a helpful way to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next area is the technology side. I&#8217;m not a very technological kind of person but it&#8217;s so important to evolve in the tools that you use and the technologies. The first change from me really came in the early days where I moved from Blogger to where I thought it&#8217;s going to be the next big thing in blogging—Movable Type. It wasn&#8217;t really the next big thing in blogging, so we eventually moved to WordPress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing I&#8217;ll say about this type of change is that I was absolutely terrified every time I made these changes. Am I going to lose my archives? Am I going to lose all my readers? Along with some of these changes, I change domains as well to get off Blogger onto my own domain, onto my own service. These types of things, many of us get petrified by these things. We&#8217;re scared by these things. These are also some of the biggest times of growth to my blog as well. Getting more control over what you can do on your blog is so important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of you were probably on that stage where you&#8217;re thinking about, &#8220;Should I shift platform? Should I shift some of the tools that I&#8217;m using?&#8221; We&#8217;ve been shifting other tools recently. We&#8217;ve just recently made a shift from using AWeber as an email tool, which has served us amazingly well over the last 10 or so years. We’ve been realizing that there&#8217;s some limitations in terms of how we can personalize our communications via email with our readers. We&#8217;re shifting across to a tool called Drip. There&#8217;s plenty of other amazing tools as well that enable you to do more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe you&#8217;re at the stage now where you need to change some of the tools that you use. Maybe it&#8217;s your email tool. Maybe it&#8217;s your landing pages. Maybe it&#8217;s your shopping cart or some of those types of things. We use shopping carts on our sites and we for many years use E-junkie which is amazing. It&#8217;s $5 a month for a tool that puts a shopping cart on your site. It served us so well. But again, we&#8217;ve outgrown it and we&#8217;ve been using some of these other tools as well. Again, there&#8217;s plenty of others out there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just ask yourself again, over the next day also, &#8220;Are the tools that I&#8217;m using holding me back in some way?&#8221; You could be leaving money on the table particularly with something like a shopping cart, an email tool. You could be leaving a lot of money on the table if you&#8217;re selling products and using tools that really aren’t feature-rich. There are so many amazing tools right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are just some of the tools we&#8217;ve tried over the last 12 months and it&#8217;s just scratching the surface. This is one of the biggest evolutions that I&#8217;ve noticed in the blogging space at the moment is there&#8217;s a whole industry around us now. 2002, you could start on Blogger and that&#8217;s about it. There was really no tools. There was a few scripts around that could enhance your tools, your platform, but now, we&#8217;re living at a time where it&#8217;s just so amazing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other thing I would say about tools is you could waste a lot of money. Most of these tools have a monthly fee associated with them. Maybe it&#8217;s time you cut back on some of your tools, too. You could be like me and be addicted to trying new things and I&#8217;m paying for that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the other bigger evolutions for me was back in 2004. Some of the evolutions for me, really, I think we&#8217;re sparked by changing my mindset. For some of you, I suspect, this would be relevant for you. You may not need to do anything differently. Maybe you need to start thinking differently about your blog. For me, it was around the time I&#8217;m starting to monetize my blog for the first time. I started to think about maybe I could be a full-time blogger one day. I was earning a little bit of money here and there from my blog. I had AdSense on my blog by this point—I&#8217;ll talk about that in a moment—and I think I was earning about $100 a week from my blog which is pretty good. I was very proud of myself and I used to spreadsheet how last month it was $90 a week. This month it&#8217;s $100 a week. Next month, it might be $110.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I began to do these spreadsheets and charts about where things could go one day. I realized, in about five years, maybe 10, I&#8217;ll be a full-time blogger. I was very excited about that, I&#8217;m very proud about that, and I used to take the spreadsheets to Vanessa and say, &#8220;Look, love. $100 a week. And it could, one day, be full-time.&#8221; She humored me. She was appreciative of that because we were on a tight budget at that time. She was a first year lawyer doing articles and I was working part time jobs. The $100 a week actually was making a difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But after a few months of me charting out my spreadsheets at the end of every month, there was a particular day when she said to me, &#8220;Darren, that&#8217;s really great, but in 10 years time when you say you could be a full-time blogger, you will be 41. Most 41 year olds have a full-time job. Maybe 10 years is too far away. Maybe we need to speed this up because you can get a fulltime job today, if you wanted.&#8221; She put it very nicely and I was like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We threw a variety of conversations. We decided that I needed to speed things up. We put a deadline of six months onto it. I need to be a full-time blogger in six months and that put a rocket under me. I realized, I&#8217;ve been treating my blog as a hobby that might one day be a business, one day. I decided that I need to start treating it as a business today. If you want your blog to be a business one day, treat it as a business today. This is the mindshift that I had to make and that day was the day that things escalated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This changed everything for me. It was the day I started to ring advertisers and say, &#8220;Do you want to advertise on my blog?&#8221; I&#8217;ve never done that before. It took me out of my comfort zone. Most of them said no, but one of them said yes, and he paid me $10 a month for the ad. That wasn&#8217;t much but he paid me $10 a month for the next year so it was $120. Then, he started paying me $20 a month. Then, he started paying me $30. Now I learned how I can serve him better. I started to get other advertisers who paid me $10, then $20, then $30 a month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a new income stream. That was the day that I started to think about how am I going to get more traffic to my blog. I started writing guest posts for other sites. That was the day I started to think about how am I going to get readers to come back to my blog who&#8217;ve already been there. I started to use email and try to work hard to gain more subscribers to my blog. I started to design systems and autoresponder sequences to get them back on a regular basis to drive more traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the day I started to try new income streams at direct advertisers but also other ad networks. That was the day that changed everything. When I started to treat my blogs as a business today. Maybe you&#8217;re at that point. Maybe you&#8217;ve got this nice little income stream and you&#8217;ve been dreaming of your blog being a fulltime business one day. Maybe you need to start doing the things you know you need to do to get to that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I wanted to talk about is editorial. Editorial is really important. As I&#8217;ve shown you before, that first blog post was all text. Things have changed since that time. The most obvious thing I think that&#8217;s changing our content, we started to add visual content to our site. There&#8217;s a lot of other things you can do to evolve your editorial strategies. Maybe it&#8217;s the mediums you&#8217;re using. Maybe you&#8217;ve been doing written content. Maybe you need to start adding some visual. Maybe you need to start doing some video. Maybe you need to start doing some live. Maybe you need to start doing some podcasting. There&#8217;s always different mediums out there and I should think they&#8217;re all blogging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Essentially, a podcast is a blog. Its content arranged in a chronological order, it doesn&#8217;t have comments, that&#8217;s probably the only thing that&#8217;s a bit different. YouTube-ing a video, it can all be blogging. We need to think about blogging in a new way. Blogging is not just written content. It&#8217;s so much more than that. This is one way that we can evolve our content. Maybe it&#8217;s the frequency of your content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I started Digital Photography School, I was doing three posts a week. I realized that one way I can get traffic is to increase the frequency of my posts. So, I went to five days a week. About six months later, I went to daily content. Now, we&#8217;re doing 14 post a week. It&#8217;s probably beyond what most bloggers can do. We&#8217;ve got a team now that&#8217;s evolved along the way, but maybe that&#8217;s one way that you can evolve your editorial strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it&#8217;s the type of content you create. When I started Digital Photography School, all of our post were tutorials. It was all information. Then, I started to add in some inspirational posts. I started to tell stories. I started to do image collections. I started to get people more in touch with their heart and their love of photography. So, I added in one post a week. There&#8217;s more inspiration content. Then, I started to add in more interaction content. We started to do weekly challenges. Got our readers to take photos and then share their photos with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Information, inspiration, interaction became the evolution in our content. We still do a lot of the information but we found that once we start to inspire people, they started to want the information more. Got to have a reason to read the information. Then, we started to get them to interact with our content. They actually started to apply the information that we&#8217;re learning. Now, we have this flow on our week where we give them a tutorial, then, we inspire them and we show them some photos that they could take with that tutorial. Then, we get them to go online and take photos that use that information. So, they really go back to the information. They get inspired but then they start to learn. This has been an evolution in our content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe you need to think about, has all your content been the one kind of content? Maybe there&#8217;s something else that you need to add in. Maybe you&#8217;ve been telling a lot of stories. Maybe you need to start teaching something. Maybe you need to do some posts in your editorial strategy that are more interactive in some way. Maybe it&#8217;s the level of your content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Photography School was purely beginner content when I started. Now, it&#8217;s more intermediate. The site has grown up with our readers. Maybe you need to start writing different types of content. Maybe you&#8217;re writing lots of evergreen content, content that doesn&#8217;t date. We&#8217;ve been doing that for a long time. Then, we started doing a little bit more news content. We started to review cameras. This is more timely content. It doesn&#8217;t last as long but it&#8217;s a different type of content that served our readers in a different way. Maybe it&#8217;s a new category on your site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Photography School, after about two years, we added a post production section—how to edit your photos. Then, we added a gear review section. These different categories expanded the site as we went along. Maybe you need to evolve your content in some way. This is one of those pillars. Persist with it, but it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to do it the same way over and over. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our community is another one of the pillars that you can evolve very quickly. Our community in Digital Photography School started with blog comments. That&#8217;s when people used to leave comments on blogs. Who remember those days, old-time bloggers? People used to leave comments and it used to be quite a few people. This post had 6–7 people leave a comment. Things have changed a bit. People are now engaging in different spaces, so maybe we need to evolve in that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We started a Flickr group. That was one of the early new ways of evolving our community in terms of engagement. Probably not relevant for most blogs today because you don&#8217;t have a photography rating community, but maybe there&#8217;s another place you can set up a group, another social network. We did a forum for a time that worked very well for us. We then started to use different types of social media to engage. We ran Twitter chats for a little while. Then, we started a Facebook page which used to work pretty well. And then more recently, a Facebook group. Facebook groups is where we see most of our engagement at the moment. It&#8217;s where a lot of successful full-time bloggers that I see are really doing very well with Facebook groups at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how long that will last. I don&#8217;t know how long Facebook will continue to promote groups. We&#8217;re already starting to see some changes in that, that Facebook already signaling that community and groups is an area where I want to see a lot more growth at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe you need to evolve in your community. Maybe it&#8217;s in your traffic. There&#8217;s a variety of different ways that you can evolve in this particular area as well. We&#8217;ve got a session on this later today. Maybe you need to be starting to create a bit more guest content. Maybe you need to think about search engine optimization, learn some skills, look at the latest trends in that. Maybe you need to engage in a new social network. Maybe you need to start networking more with fellow bloggers in your niche.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, this is one of the key things that you can do to drive more traffic is to actually learn about who else is in your niche and to reach out to them. Then, look at win-win collaboration between them. This is probably one of the areas that we&#8217;ve seen the most growth in our blogging within our niches. Actually, getting to know your competitors and become friends with your competitors is one of the fastest ways you can grow your blog if you can find some win-win ways; a variety of things you can do there for traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, there&#8217;s monetization. I know a lot of you are here in this conference to learn more about how to monetize your blog. This for us, has been an incredible evolution. For me, it started with AdSense and Amazon, very awkward starts and very slow starts. This is our first month of AdSense earnings. This is after I&#8217;ve been blogging for two years. I already had a really good audience by this stage. First day, we made AU$12. I was so excited. $12 a day is amazing. There, I realized, all my friends were clicking my ads like crazy to make us that and that could have gotten us kicked out of AdSense. Then, it went back—after a day I told them to stop—to about $1 a day, $1.50 a day. It wasn&#8217;t even enough to buy coffee and this is after years of building my audience. That was really very slow, depressingly slow, but it was something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was proud of those dollars a day, in the early days, even if that wasn&#8217;t that much. Gradually, I have a ton of crew. You can see here for the first six months, it was $1 a day. It really didn&#8217;t change. This is around the time that I started to have these mindset shift. I started to realize that if I was going to grow this income, I needed to get smart about driving more traffic and getting better at using AdSense. This is the same for any income stream that you might want to add. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then things escalated. August 2004, we started an Olympic Games blog. That was the Athens Olympics. It was a very profitable month. Then, it went back down again. This is about driving traffic, this is about driving more engagement, getting more email subscribers, and getting better at using AdSense. It continued to grow and this is the first two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason I wanted to share with you this one because it all fell apart for a little while here. Sometimes, evolutions don&#8217;t work and unexpected things happened. We fell out of Google completely for six weeks there. We stood to this day, don&#8217;t really know why. Sometimes, it starts really slow. A lot of you probably at this phase at your income streams, don&#8217;t give up. Persist. Keep learning how to do that income stream better because you don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to end up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For us, the evolution has been going through a different type of income streams. We&#8217;ve looked at direct ad sales, affiliate promotions, other advertising networks, I wrote a book. Most of these ones here didn&#8217;t really worked that well. The book didn&#8217;t make much money, speaking didn&#8217;t make much money, consulting didn&#8217;t make much money, job board is another real slow burner. It&#8217;s actually grown for us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, everything changed in 2009 when I discovered ebooks. This is our first ebook. Some of you heard me talked about it before. I procrastinated on writing this ebook for three years. I started Digital Photography School with a view that I would write an ebook in 2006. I didn&#8217;t write it until 2009. I was too busy. I didn&#8217;t know how to write an ebook. I didn&#8217;t know how to sell an ebook. I was scared. That was my real reason. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2009, I took my own 15 minutes a day challenge. I write my ebook 15 minutes at a time. I got up early every morning and I wrote it. It took me four months to write it, to get it ready for launch, to write the sales page, to get the emails ready to launch the thing. At eleven o&#8217;clock one night, in 2009, I&#8217;ve sent the email, petrified about how my readers would respond to this ebook. Me trying to sell them something. Most of the content on the ebook was already in the blog. I was scared that I was going to really push back hard. Nothing at all happened for 10 minutes after I sent that email. Then, I got a sale. That four months of work made me US$14.99. That&#8217;s about $18. It really wasn&#8217;t worth it at that moment. $18 for four months of work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, nine minutes later, another sale came in. It became a little bit more worth it. Then, the sales started coming in every eight minutes, every seven minutes, every six minutes, and by this stage, it&#8217;s like 1:00 AM and I was like, &#8220;[&#8230;],&#8221; calculating how much I was making. Then, I started coming every two minutes. Then, every minute. Then, every thirty seconds and everything changed. I was so excited, but I wished I&#8217;ve done it three years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That often is what happens when you procrastinate. This changed everything. This was the beginning of a whole new income stream from the blog. This is all part of this evolution. That launched did really well. We sold for about 5000 copies of that other than the first week or so of that launch. More important for me is that it was actually a start of another evolution. Now, we have lots of ebooks. Over the last eight years, we&#8217;ve published a lot of ebooks, 30 or so of them. Some of them we&#8217;re done better than that done and some of them had done a lot worse, but every time we launched, we learn something about how our readers react to these products and how to market them better in different ways. Then, part of the evolution is to take courses. We&#8217;ve done six courses now. We&#8217;ve done software as well. This is all part of that evolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monetization is something you&#8217;ve got to persist. You&#8217;ve got to be proactive. You can&#8217;t be passive. You need to put the work in. It does take a lot of work but evolve. The other part of our evolution with products and monetization is this is how I launched that first ebook. That first ebook, all I did to launch it was send two emails, write one blog post, and do three tweets. I had no idea what I was doing, but it worked really well and I&#8217;m glad it did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We&#8217;ve evolved our launches slightly. Now, this is what we do. We don&#8217;t do all of these for every launch but there&#8217;s a lot of evolution in our launches. We do pre-launch stuff. We do a variety of types of blogpost during a launch. We send multiple emails over a launch and they all go to a different type of email. We do testimonial emails. Occasionally, we&#8217;ve done webinars. We&#8217;ve done a variety of different social media things and we do now stuff on our site as well. You will get all of these slides so you can have a really deep look at this later if you like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, evolve. Not just your income streams, but how you use those income streams as well. I will say, whatever the evolution that I’ve shown you, every single one of them has been accompanied by fear. That&#8217;s a good sign. Fear is a signal that something important is about to happen. No important moment in your life has happened without fear. Also, it comes with excitement. You use the excitement. Don&#8217;t let the fear stop you. Learn as you evolve as well. All the evolutions bring about learning for the next evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing I&#8217;ll say about what I&#8217;ve shown you, that timeline I&#8217;ve shown you, that was just the good stuff. All those things with good things, but then a lot of really bad things along the way as well. A lot of it I tried. There are things that I&#8217;ve tried over the years have not worked. I started two blog networks. You would&#8217;ve thought that after the first lesson that I wouldn&#8217;t start on the second one. Both of them didn&#8217;t do very well, but I learned so much during those.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started other blogs that haven&#8217;t work for different reasons. Was anyone on [&#8230;]? You would have thought that from a loader like that, that I would&#8217;ve known that was not a good social network to get on? I&#8217;ve invested hundreds of hours on [&#8230;]. It&#8217;s just after Twitter came about. It&#8217;s this new thing that was going to change everything and everyone was going to be on [&#8230;]. It turns out no one was on [&#8230;]. It&#8217;s just me. I started writing at ProBlogger community and it was an income stream. This is a public folio, something that worked but didn&#8217;t really worked to my satisfaction. We had to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s been these false starts, there&#8217;s been these failures, but every time I failed, I learned something. All of these things have been formed where we&#8217;re at today as well. You will have these failures. I want to paint a picture of just try new things that will work. A lot of them won’t, but they can be as important parts of your evolution as everything else. Some of them will grow fast, some of them will grow slow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are my two blogs, ProBlogger and Digital Photography School. I should&#8217;ve given up on Digital Photography School about here. It was just too slow. It wasn&#8217;t growing very fast at all. But today, if that graph continued, it would be 10 times bigger than ProBlogger. I&#8217;m really glad I stuck at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of those income streams, AdSense, was really slow. I probably should&#8217;ve given up on it in early days, but I&#8217;m glad I persisted with it. You&#8217;ll have those times where things really don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re working. Sometimes you just need to persist—evolve. You will have other things that will work really well and it will be an overnight success. Just go with the flow. Learn as you go through these things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last thing I want to say is that it&#8217;s really important to evolve. We all know that but a lot of us also know that feeling of revolving, going in circles. This is where most of us get stuck. There&#8217;s a variety of reasons why we get stuck, I love this bottom GIF. I had to include it. Just watch. Watch. Sorry. No child was hurt during this. I don&#8217;t really know if that would hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I would go pass that because you won&#8217;t take any things. There&#8217;s a variety of reasons why we revolve. I just want to say I go through these because I know a lot of you at this stage, procrastination is the big one. It&#8217;s been my big one. I procrastinated so much. I did a podcast on procrastination this year. If you are procrastinating, go and listen to that podcast. Don&#8217;t procrastinate. It will never be perfect before you start it. Analysis paralysis is the other one. Again, it will never be perfect before you start, so just start anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other big one that&#8217;s been a big one for me is fear. You&#8217;ve got to step forward into your fear. You&#8217;ve got to acknowledge it but don&#8217;t let it stop you. If you need to hold a hand of someone else, there&#8217;s plenty of people in the room who will go into that fear with you. Wobbly courage is the thing we&#8217;ve talked about in this event in the past. You don&#8217;t have to be brave and get rid of fear. You need to step forward knowing you&#8217;re fearful. Wobbly courage is so important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes we revolve because we built a machine that we have to keep feeding. I talked to a number of you in this room over the last year. You&#8217;ve built the thing that&#8217;s working, but you absolutely hate it. But it&#8217;s paying your mortgage, so you have to keep feeding it. That&#8217;s a horrible place to be stuck. Maybe you need to start a passion project on the side and evolve that. Maybe you need to try and find a way to evolve what you&#8217;re doing into the thing that you do love. Maybe it&#8217;s time to sell that thing and start something new. This is one of the reasons. I felt this and I&#8217;m more than happy to talk to you if you&#8217;re in that place as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are other reasons why we revolve. It&#8217;s because we built a system, we just get lazy, and we just keep doing it. This is something that I&#8217;ve done this year. I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;ve been doing the same thing on Facebook, my Facebook page, for three years now. It really worked well for three years and it doesn&#8217;t work well anymore. I just built the system. Earlier this year, I decided to do some more learning on Facebook. I did a course and I learned some new skills, I&#8217;m trying some new things. So, look at those systems that you built, that used to work well, and be really smart about evolving those systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last one is it&#8217;s very easy to revolve and do things because everyone else is doing it. In the blogging space, most of us have done it. We all jumped onto Snapchat because everyone&#8217;s on Snapchat, but why are we on Snapchat? Are our readers on Snapchat? Is it working? Maybe Snapchat is good for your audience but we don&#8217;t need to do that because everyone else is doing it. Be harsh on the way that you spend your time. Ask, &#8220;Is this relevant for my audience? Is this relevant for me and my personality?&#8221; Rather than just getting stuck and doing whatever everyone else is doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This event, I encourage you to persist. I encourage you to look for the next steps on how you evolve. I encourage you to write down as you hear today, write down the things that resonate with you. Write down the possible actions that you can take. Then, at the end of the day, I encourage you to look at those things that you&#8217;ve written down. Look for the patterns in those things and then prioritize what you&#8217;re going to do. That&#8217;s really important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hope is that as a result of today, you&#8217;re going to get your next steps. You&#8217;re going to get some ways that you can evolve your blog. What I want you to do is to just take a moment and write down on your action list whatever/however you want to do that, what’s your thing about your weakest pillar? Content, engagement, traffic, monetization. Which of those have you been ignoring? Which one do you need to evolve? And anything else that you&#8217;ve heard that you need to apply in your own blog? Just take a moment to do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, just turn to someone next to you. If you want to just share something from that session that you want to apply or a question that you&#8217;ve got that you want to ask, an action item that you&#8217;ve written down, just for a moment, just share that with each other. It&#8217;s really important to verbalize the things that we&#8217;re learning. So, just [&#8230;] for one moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, we&#8217;re going to keep things moving; try and stay on schedule today. We&#8217;ve got another half an hour session now and we&#8217;re going to have morning tea break. One other thing, as I was thinking about evolution, as I prepare that talk, I realized that there&#8217;s some amazing stories in this room of evolution. As I was talking, I was looking at different people and thinking, &#8220;Man, your blog has really changed.&#8221; Some of the stories in this room were really great. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the stories that came to my mind was Pat. Someone that I came across, I reckon, back in 2009–2010, we must have connected from the first time. We did an interview. I interview Pat. It wasn&#8217;t even a podcast, I just interviewed him. I don&#8217;t even know why I interviewed him at the  time. It was an audio interview and it still exists. It&#8217;s still there. We have both changed so much. The interview was bizarre. I listen to it recently. We were both very naive, fresh, and excited. Not that we&#8217;re not excited anymore, but things have changed a lot there. As I think back to 2009, your blog, Pat, I just thought it&#8217;ll be really interesting to have a bit of conversation now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We want this session to be a chance for you to hear a little bit about Pat&#8217;s evolution. Also, I really want about 15 minutes of Q&amp;A. If you&#8217;ve got any question for Pat or myself but mainly Pat, I will signal that in about 10 minutes time. We&#8217;re going to use two microphones here. We&#8217;ll just ask you to come up and speak your question into the microphone because the recordings for this event are going to be available to you. You&#8217;re also going to get the recordings for the Melbourne event that happens next week. When we evolve our presentations and make them better for the Melbourne people, you can actually listen in on that event as well. So, we do ask you to use the microphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just thought it would be interesting, Pat. Welcome Pat, everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: Pat&#8217;s going to deliver a great closing keynote today. Pat, you have evolved what you&#8217;ve done incredibly. You want to take us back, maybe, to the early days? Maybe name a couple of the early evolutions that were really important for you in your journey?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Absolutely. First of all, thank you for having me here. I know I&#8217;m the one with the funny accent in this room. It&#8217;s funny because I remember one time watching you, you were doing a livestream before livestreams were even a thing. I remember, Darren was up there and I was just so dumbfounded. You were my idol back in the day. You&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take any questions.&#8221; I typed in a question and Darren said, &#8220;Oh, Pat.&#8221; I flipped out. I couldn&#8217;t believe that you would say my name. To be here on stage today as somebody providing information to your students is just fantastic. Thank you for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a really interesting evolution as many of you know. If you know my story, I got laid off in the architecture industry. I never planned on any of this. Back in 2008 when I was told I was going to be let go, which was two months after I proposed to my wife, I just flipped out. I didn’t know what I was going to do. It was actually through a podcast—that was the early days of the podcast—I discovered one called Internet Business Mastery. I heard an interview with a man named Cornelius who is making six figures a year, helping people pass a project management exam. That was my &#8220;Aha!&#8221; lightbulb moment where then, I was like, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve taken some exams in the architecture industry. Maybe I can be like this guy. I don&#8217;t even know what to do. I&#8217;m just going to start a blog and see what happens.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing that happened was, I started to question what I was doing. I started to question, why am I even doing this? Is this even worth it? Then, I went to the process of writing an ebook as well. Flipping out the time I posted it, seeing nothing happen, realizing that maybe I shouldn&#8217;t even be going down this road to begin with. Then at 8:40 AM the next morning, I saw a PayPal notification come in. For me, it was the highlight of my life at that time. I couldn&#8217;t believe that I had done something, posted it on the internet, and somebody paid me for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ten seconds after that sale, that joy, I started to think, &#8220;This is it.&#8221; I started to freak out and get scared. What if this person sues me for some reason or asks for a refund? I had to go outside on a walk because I was just hyperventilating. Then, I came back and I saw another email from another sale. I had made a sale while I was on a walk. That just completely changed my life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that. I started to get these emails from my customers saying, &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and they were calling me by name. &#8220;Thank you, Pat.&#8221; &#8220;Pat, thank you so much for putting this together.&#8221; That was new to me and something I never thought was possible because in the architecture world, I actually have my fingerprint on several different restaurants in the US, but  nobody would ever know that. Nobody will ever thank me for any work I had done as an architect, but here it was helping people in this tiny little exams space. People we&#8217;re saying thank you and me writing essays worth of their life story. I was only helping them pass an exam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I went through a time in 2009, when the United States Green Building Council, who is the organization that puts on these exams, they came out with their own study guide. I thought, I was done. Why would people want to buy my study guide when they can get the study guide from the people who actually write the same questions? I was like, &#8220;Okay, I should start looking for another architecture job soon.&#8221; That was my highest grossing month ever. The reason was, people found that there where these guides and found mine and said, &#8220;Oh, I like yours because I can relate to you, because I know you&#8217;re somebody who&#8217;s just a few steps ahead of me.&#8221; That was the big first moment of, “Wow, this is what really works online.” It&#8217;s being yourself and putting yourself out there that nobody is like you. Therefore, that is your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember in 2010, I went to one of my mentors and I came to him with 20 different business ideas. He said, &#8220;You know, these are okay, but you know what&#8217;s missing out of all of them? You. You&#8217;re not in any of these. This is a review site for this. This is a tool to help people do that but you are not in any of this.&#8221; That was the time when I started my podcast to open up and let people into my life just a little bit to get to know who I was as a person. As a result of that, people became very attached to me, my message, and what I was doing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were other times when I wanted to give up. There was a time in 2012 when I just wanted to completely shut down the podcast because I started to see the numbers were exactly the same. I wasn&#8217;t getting any results. Then, one day, right before I was going to give up, I get this email from a guy. His name is Michal from Poland. It&#8217;s literally seven pages in link in those emails. I&#8217;m not going to read it. The subject line says, &#8220;You have changed my life. Please read this.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Okay, I guess I&#8217;ll read it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was reading it, he&#8217;s telling me the story of how he discovered my blog and he discovered my podcast. This was at the time when he had two broken legs after the result of the snowboarding accident. Then, I was coaching him through his rehabilitation. This was going on for a year-and-a-half without me knowing it. He said that he had set a goal for himself. One thing that I talked about in one of my blog posts was setting goals that are almost impossible for yourself. He decided with two broken legs to run a marathon. I saw a picture at the bottom of his email of him crossing the finish line of the Warsaw Full Marathon, 22.6 miles, holding up a banner. It was in Polish so I didn&#8217;t know what it said until he translated it. He said, &#8220;Thank you, God. Thank you,&#8221; to his family and, &#8220;Thank you Pat Flynn.&#8221; And I was just bawling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time I was reading this, there was mascara running down on my keyboard. It was just not a pretty picture. That was the point realized, there are so many people out there who we don&#8217;t even know we are affecting. That made me want to keep going. There might be a Michal for you out there who&#8217;s reading your stuff and you don&#8217;t even know their name. It wasn&#8217;t until he said, &#8220;This is what you did for me,&#8221; that I then realized that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There have been moments like going across different kinds of platforms. I started out with a blog in 2008 and then I explored YouTube in 2009, then podcasting in 2010, but then, the big one is getting on stage. I have never ever wanted to get on stage before because I just had that fear. But I had learned through going on to YouTube and going into podcasting that, that fear is what you should actually look toward and step through like what you&#8217;re saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Steven Pressfiled who wrote The War of Art calls that the resistance. That thing that you feel, it could be in many forms—procrastination, self doubt, fear. That&#8217;s actually, like Darren was saying, a sign, that that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s important to you. There&#8217;s always something amazing on the other end of that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve grown so much in terms of the confidence that I had. Only recently have I now adopted what I called the CEO mindset. In the beginning, I was just a scrappy entrepreneur, just putting things together as they come which then, in blog form, just turns into this mess of a blog with just all these plugins and things on it. It wasn&#8217;t until I made the decision to really get smart and plan ahead in my editorial calendar, and with what I was promoting, that things started to finally fall into place. I&#8217;ve now since released courses of my own which was a huge step for me getting over the idea of actually selling something to my audience that was my own. I was always doing affiliate marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think out of all the evolutions, the biggest one came in 2009 when my son was born. There&#8217;s this thing called the baby effect. When you have a baby, nothing is more important in your life except that little creature. That forces you to really understand where&#8217;s your time being placed. Are you getting back what you&#8217;re putting with that time? I felt like everytime I would catch myself in a YouTube rabbit hole—the weird part of the internet—I was taking time away from my family, from my kids. I became super efficient at that point, keeping track of every minute, what I was doing, and was it actually something that was helping me move the needle or was it actually something that was just trying to keep me staying busy, just to have that feeling like I was staying busy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That baby effect helped me become super efficient and helped me understand what my output was versus the input. That&#8217;s when things started to accelerate a lot, too. Also, prioritizing, helping me realize that I don&#8217;t have to do everything, that everytime I say yes to something, I&#8217;m also saying no to something else. Does that make sense? When you say yes to something, you’re also saying no to something else. I always thought about my kids when I say yes to something. What am I taking away from them? Is this worth actually doing that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you begin to grow, you start to get more opportunities. A lot of those opportunities are going to be very juicy; just attractive. But knowing where it is you want to go and knowing what&#8217;s important to you is going to help you make these decisions a lot easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: Wow. You make interviewing really easy. That&#8217;s great. Do you have any questions for Pat that you want to ask? It might be about the evolution. Come at the microphones if you do and maybe just say what your name is and ask your question. There’s a microphone here. If you want to line up, more than happy just to go straight to you now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adele: Hi, Pat. My name&#8217;s Adele. Firstly, you&#8217;re the reason I came because I saw you last year at XY and I was very excited, and I obviously love your podcast. I&#8217;ve been to traditional financial planning where I&#8217;ve worked with people one-on-one. Just about to launch my first one-to-many model. The question that I&#8217;m struggling with is how to price it. The financial is a membership style site, it&#8217;s a weekly fee. The financial planner in me has done 50 models. The drop out rates are going to be 30% and if my marketing cost are these&#8230; I&#8217;ve done all the modeling but I&#8217;m still struggling with how to price it. Do I price it high and then drop? Or do I drop and then increase? How do you price it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Pricing is a huge topic for sure. There&#8217;s a number of different ways to go about understanding what your price is. You could compare versus what other options are out there. Use that as a starting point. Are you offering more value than what&#8217;s already being offered? Therefore, you should be charging more. In addition to that, you should also understand what it is you&#8217;re providing and what can that give back to them in the long run to make sense as an investment to be working with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I would also recommend is when you launch something, launch with a beta group. That way, you can start at a very low price to get people in and understand, &#8220;Okay, what is working and what&#8217;s not?&#8221; You can even utilize that feedback to understand, &#8220;Okay, what is the true value of what I&#8217;m offering?&#8221; to the base your price point out of. Then, of course, based on that, you&#8217;re going to have testimonials that you can use for you public launch. That&#8217;s typically the way that I would recommend launching anything. It&#8217;s a controlled environment to be able to then utilize that data, moving forward into a public launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adele: Okay, thank you. Just a quick follow up. With the membership site then, what’s the drop-off rate that you expect? If people are paying a monthly web subscription, are there typical drop-off?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: A typical drop-off rate, I believe depends on the industry. Three months to six months is the normal drop-off rate. There are some strategies involved with that. For example, right before the three month mark, send your juiciest best tip in email to help people realize, &#8220;Oh, I should stick around when the next billing cycle comes.&#8221; Know when that drop-off rate is going to happen and that&#8217;s only going to happen over time. Then, you can put strategies into place to make sure people remember why they should continue to pay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s the thing with membership model that&#8217;s tough is you&#8217;re continually asking people to pay. You need to remind them and let them know why they need to continue to pay. It&#8217;s not like a Netflix account or sometimes you just forget. People will know that they&#8217;re paying for that and they want to make sure they&#8217;re getting something back for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adele: Okay, cheers. Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Man: Pat, I am a current member of your Smart From Scratch course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Thank you. Awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Man: Thank you for putting that up. My question is related to that. Starting from scratch, people who are getting into this the first time, what do you find are the common struggles and what’s your advice for that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: There&#8217;s a lot of struggles at the beginning of anything that we do. How do we know what the next steps are? How do we know that we&#8217;re right for this? As I like to say, every master starts as a disaster. You&#8217;re going to have to get through that crazy disaster part in order to get and grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I feel is great and the best tips that I can offer is to get inspiration from somebody who&#8217;s done it already and you are probably in the right place if you&#8217;re doing that right now because Darren is an amazing mentor to have for all of us. In addition to that, things like mastermind groups, getting together, to have people hold you accountable as well, just to be that outside perspective looking in because sometimes, we can be so deep into our own stuff that we don&#8217;t see the obvious. Sometimes, we need another person just to help put things back into perspective for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why things like communities, whether it&#8217;s a paid community or a free community or a group and getting involved with people there. I&#8217;m preaching to the choir here because you&#8217;re coming to events. This is the perfect place to connect and meet people that I hope you like to go home and continue these relationships that you&#8217;re about to build over this weekend. That by far, is the most important thing. Then, also just realizing that failure is part of the process. It is a learning experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grew up in a house where I would come home with a math test. I get a 96% on it. Then, my dad will go, &#8220;What happened to the other 4%, Pat?&#8221; I was growing up with this idea that you to be perfect all the time. In business, if you try to be perfect, you&#8217;re never going to take any action. You&#8217;re never going to be bold enough to take the action that you need that&#8217;s actually going to give you the results. Understanding that with a little bit of guidance, you have to move forward, take bold actions, realizing that you could totally fail. That&#8217;s good. You want to fail fast, almost, so you can get to those learning points much faster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Man: Thanks, Pat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Woman: Thanks, Darren, for bringing out such great speakers. I&#8217;m just to ask my imperfect question. If you had no interest in branding yourself, none whatsoever, but I have several sites, different niches, that I&#8217;m a man in many of them, but you want that authenticity that you just spoke about, how important it is, you are your best asset, as you said so, to give of yourself. How do you do that as an avatar? How do you give up your best but you don&#8217;t want to brand yourself out there for various reasons?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: There&#8217;s many reasons to not necessarily put yourself out there so much. It can still be done. I think it relates to the content and the interactions that you have with your audience. You can still be personable without sharing your name. I know a number of avatars who’ve become very successful online in many different niches. Some of them, because they just don&#8217;t want to get known in that particular industry because then if they&#8217;re bossing you, they would get fired most likely. Other times, they&#8217;re not just comfortable of having other people know their names. The way that you become personable is you ask questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it was James Schramko, who&#8217;s speaking later. I just love that he once told me, &#8220;You got to stop trying to be so interesting and start getting interested.&#8221; That has changed how I’ve communicated with my audience. Not me, me, me, me. It&#8217;s more, &#8220;Hey, how can I help you? What are the problems that you&#8217;re having? What are the struggles that you&#8217;re having?&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t matter who you are. If you&#8217;re somebody who is asking somebody, &#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221; that&#8217;s personable, that&#8217;s memorable, and it doesn&#8217;t matter what your name is. You can still do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Woman: Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Woman: This sounds very cool. Hi, can you put this down a little?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: You&#8217;re good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Woman: Hey, I&#8217;ve been blogging for about five years now. I feel like all my raving fans are already buying my product, service, and engaging my stuff, but I felt like for about a year now, I&#8217;m really struggling to expand that. I’m [&#8230;] with growth. I&#8217;m wondering, are there any tips to increasing your engagement, network, traffic, and how to get other people to read, and engage with what you&#8217;re doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: This is actually what I&#8217;ve spoke about in 2014 at ProBlogger in the Gold Coast. It was just this idea of building more raving fans. I love that you&#8217;re focused on building that because that&#8217;s really where the power is in your brand. What do you think about who your customers are going to be? Where the most interaction engagements come from? It&#8217;s not all the brand new cold traffic that you&#8217;re trying to bring in. It&#8217;s the people who&#8217;ve been a part of your brand for a while, who just absolutely love what you do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, there&#8217;s many different ways to go about getting people from the bottom of the pyramid up to that top where raving fans are. One of my favorite strategies is providing small wins. I used to think that every single blog post had to be like a revolutionary huge deal, something that would just get monstrous reviews and shared all over the world. That actually stopped me from writing a lot because I thought everything had to be that big. Actually, it&#8217;s the smaller, &#8220;Here&#8217;s something you can do in five minutes that can be really helpful,&#8221; kind of articles that actually make the biggest difference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I actually remember one of the first blogs besides yours, Darren, that I read was by a man named Ramith Sethi called iwillteachyoutoberich.com. Not rich like money, but just rich in life and fulfillment. I remember coming across his blog when I read it on and off. There was one article that said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how you can save 20% on your cable bill in 15 minutes.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Really? Can you do that?&#8221; I read the post. It gives you the script that you use when you call your cable company to save 20%. I said, &#8220;Okay, what have I got to lose? This will either work or not. I&#8217;ll found out in 15 minutes.&#8221; I did it, it worked. I became a fan of Ramith&#8217;s for life. That small little thing worked and I saw it. I wanted more from him. What small things can you offer? Maybe even challenges and things like that to your non-raving fan is all it needs to help them realize you are somebody worth paying attention to and becoming a raving fan of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other important component to lead people up to that point would be getting people involved in a community and having them not just engaged with you but engaged with each other as well. It reminds me of when my wife, who&#8217;s a huge fan of the Backstreet Boys, she literally just came from Vegas to watch them. Nick Carter is like her second husband, apparently. She had mentioned that when she was there, she met a bunch of people who&#8217;d she never met before. They immediately had their stories, their history with Backstreet Boys to connect with each other. That helped just elevate the boys—her boys as she calls them—even more. Are you giving your audience an opportunity to meet, chat, and talk with each other that can help elevate your brand as well?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: Cool. We&#8217;ll do these last two, nice and quick if we can. Then we&#8217;ll have some [&#8230;].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lory: Hey, my name is Lory. I follow the both of you and I attribute a lot of our success to you. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Thanks, Lory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lory: Just a question about Facebook. I currently have a Facebook business page and got a very niche audience of dieticians. We&#8217;ve got most of the dieticians in Australia on our Facebook business page. I&#8217;m wondering about Facebook groups and if it would be worth transitioning them to a group or just keep them in the business page?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: If you want community and engagement, a group is where you want people to go. What I would recommend doing actually would be to potentially serve ads to your Facebook page since you&#8217;ve worked so hard to collect those people [&#8230;] contacts to get them on your email list. That way, you can essentially do whatever you want with them. I think, a group is where you want to bring people to go to get into communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I also know that Facebook is making changes too. I heard through the grapevine that they&#8217;re going to essentially somehow begin to start creating algorithms within the groups, potentially even paying to serve ads to groups. It&#8217;s just not really what I want to hear but we really have no control over that. We can only go with what we have access to at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A group, I still feel, has been just amazing. I have a page as well with 180,000 contacts. A group of only 30,000, relatively speaking, is much smaller but there&#8217;s so much more activity there. It&#8217;s an amazing place, too, where your audience can help your audience. I go in there and questions were being answered without even me having to answer them. It&#8217;s a great place for networking and connections. Similar to the previous question, it&#8217;s a great place where your community can talk with each other and that helps elevate your brand, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lory: Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: You&#8217;re welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: The last one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Man: Hey, quick question. I remember recently that someone mentioned that course you launched. It was last year or early this year. I saw on social media, someone ripped into a bit about the course calling you a scam or something. Instead of ignoring it or defending yourself, you actually offered him the course for free. I&#8217;m wondering what the result of that was? I presumed he didn&#8217;t take it up. What you&#8217;re thinking behind that was in replying that way?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: One thing that I&#8217;ve learned over time is that there&#8217;s going to be haters. Haters are going to hate. Initially, back in 2009 and 2010, it really used to frazzle me. I would stop working for weeks because I was just so distraught over what that one person said. Actually, there was another time back in 2011, I think, where a person left this 2000 or 3000 word comment on my blog. It&#8217;s really nasty. Of course, I just deleted it, but then, all of my friends started emailing me saying, &#8220;Hey, who&#8217;s this guy who just left a comment on my blog?&#8221; He had copied and pasted that comment and posted it on every site that I was featured on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped working for a month because I was just like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this anymore. Maybe he&#8217;s right.&#8221; Then, I talked to a lot of my friends and my mastermind group. First of all, they were like, &#8220;Dude, haters? It&#8217;s a good sign. It means you&#8217;re doing something right.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m doing something right, right now.&#8221; Then, it was another person who said, &#8220;You know, every second you spend thinking about this person is a second you&#8217;re taking away from hundreds and thousands of people who needs you. Stop. Stop.&#8221; So I stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I was just very curious. I emailed him and I said, &#8220;Hey, I can&#8217;t believe you did what you did but I forgive you. Trying to come from a place of forgiving, why did you do what you do?&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t expecting a response but he did respond. He said, &#8220;Pat, I knew you&#8217;re a very popular blogger. You seem like an easy target. I just wanted traffic to my website.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t help but just laugh a little. You thought that was a legit strategy? I was like, &#8220;You should take my course.&#8221; But I didn&#8217;t have a course at that time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This recent course that I came out with, people will say such things and I have to know that that&#8217;s not true. I know that&#8217;s not true. I&#8217;ve helped hundreds and thousands of people. In order for me to help this person understand because I know it&#8217;s just either a miscommunication or this person is coming from something dark that happened on their end and they&#8217;re just reflecting it on to me because I&#8217;m an easy target. I just offered it to him. I didn&#8217;t hear anything back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There have been other people who have been trolls in the past who I&#8217;ve reached out, too. I actually had conversations with them on Skype which isn&#8217;t always recommended. Then, a lot of times those people just have misunderstandings. They see somebody reporting their income online and they think immediately that they&#8217;re a bad person. Then, after getting to know me a little bit, they realize, and actually some of them are my biggest fans now, which is really cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That stuff can happen. It is a good sign because it means you&#8217;re doing something bold. If you&#8217;re always in the middle trying to please everybody, you&#8217;re probably not going big enough. That&#8217;s the other thing that I&#8217;ve learned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Man: Awesome. Thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: It&#8217;s a great note to finish on. Thanks so much, Pat, for sharing. We all look forward to your closing keynote. Today, we thank Pat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pat: Thank you, everybody,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Darren: I hoped you enjoyed today&#8217;s podcast. It&#8217;s a bit different to normal being a keynote, but I hope that also gave you a bit of a taste for what we do at our events. Again, if you want to check out our events, we are holding it in Melbourne, Australia. For some of you, it&#8217;ll be a bit of a trip to get out. Particularly if you&#8217;re in Australia, or New Zealand, or even different parts of Asia, or you&#8217;re willing to come to Australia for a little bit of holiday, we&#8217;d love you to come to either our training day for beginners or our mastermind group on the 10th and 11th of August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, you can head over to problogger.com/events and you&#8217;ll see both of the options there. Otherwise, check out the podcast show notes today where there&#8217;s a full transcription of the whole show today. Our transcriptionist is going to be working hard because there&#8217;s a lot of content in today. Again, the shownotes today at problogger.com/podcast/278.</span></p>

		<itunes:summary>Today, I&#039;ve got a special treat, a keynote that I gave a couple of years ago at our ProBlogger event in Melbourne. It&#039;s titled Evolve Don&#039;t Revolve. It&#039;s all about how as bloggers and online entrepreneurs. It is really easy to revolve in our blogging, to just go around in circles. The call of this keynote is to look at seven different areas where you can evolve your blog and online business. I also want to tell you about a new event coming up in August of this year on the 10th and 11th of August, again, in Melbourne. There&#039;s two options for those of you who want to come to our event in Melbourne. &lt;br /&gt;</itunes:summary>

<p>Are you limiting the potential of your blog by &#8216;forgetting&#8217; a few things?</p>
<p>There’s a lot to think about when you’re blogging, and so it’s easy to forget (or know you <span style="font-style: italic;">should be </span>doing them but never quite working out how).</p>
<p>But while not doing these three things won’t kill your blog (you can still carry on without them), it could seriously limit your blog’s potential.</p>
<p>And what <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> these three things?</p>
<ol>
<li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>The “big picture” of content</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at each one, and why bloggers often don’t pay enough attention to them.</p>
<h2>#1: Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
<p>At the ProBlogger event a couple of years ago, I asked a group of seven or eight bloggers two questions.</p>
<p>My first was, <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Where do you put most of your attention in terms of building traffic?”</span></p>
<p>Their responses included Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn, guest posting, writing for Medium, paid advertising, and networking with influencers.</p>
<p>I loved the variety of answers. But I found it fascinating that not a single blogger (myself included) said their main focus for building traffic was search engine optimization.</p>
<p>My second question was, <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Where do you get most of your traffic?”</span></p>
<p>This time, most of them said their number one traffic source was Google. (For most of them, number two was whatever they were putting most of their attention into.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">It’s great to focus on more than just SEO when building traffic. But what would happen if we put more attention into driving traffic from Google?</span> Most of the full-time bloggers I’ve met say Google brings between 40% and 60% of their traffic.</p>
<p>Right now there’s a lot of attention on driving traffic with social media. But maybe we need to start focusing on search again.</p>
<p>So why do bloggers ignore SEO? I think many see it as being too hard or too technical. But even I’ve reaped the rewards of spending a bit of time on SEO every day. And I’m the most non-technical person I know.</p>
<p>And you don’t need to get obsessive about it either. Here are a few simple things you can do to increase your Google traffic.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set up your blog the right way.</span> At a minimum, use an SEO plugin. You might also want to check out episode 94 of the podcast: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/5-mistakes-bloggers-make-with-seo-and-what-to-do-about-them/">5 Mistakes Bloggers Make with SEO and What to Do About Them</a></span>.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn how to optimize your content.</span> Learn how to use headings (and keywords within them).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Think about the keywords people would search for </span>to find your content. What would someone type into Google if they wanted to read a post like yours?</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Try to get extra links to your site from other sites.</span> For one great way to do that, check out <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/building-links/">How to Build Hundreds of Links to Your Blog in 5 Minutes a Day</a></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A couple of years ago I realized I was spending several hours a day on social media and no time on SEO.</p>
<p>So I flipped it around and focused more on SEO. I spent five or ten minutes a day building links to my blog, and learned how to optimize my content to appear <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://moz.com/blog/optimize-featured-snippets">in Google’s featured snippets</a></span>. The result? A big increase in my search engine traffic.</p>
<h2>#2: Email</h2>
<p>A lot of bloggers feel some sort of guilt around email. They know it’s important because everyone keeps telling them how powerful it is. Unfortunately, a lot of them get stuck in one of four places.</p>
<p>But before I talk about those four places, I want to make it clear how important email really is.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email doesn’t drive as much traffic as search or social. But what it </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">does </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">do is drive traffic with </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">intent</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span>People click through on emails to read content, buy a product, or engage in a community discussion.</p>
<p>On ProBlogger and Digital Photography School (DPS) we use email to drive people to our Facebook group, our blog posts, our Facebook pages, and so on. It’s vital for building engagement on our sites.</p>
<p>And email is the ultimate sales source for our own products and affiliate promotions. If you want to monetize what you’re doing, it’s crucial.</p>
<p>It’s also great for building a brand. For readers who aren’t on Facebook every day (or who aren’t on Twitter or Pinterest or Instagram at all), email is the number one touch point they have with us.</p>
<p>But bloggers often don’t use email effectively (if at all) because they get stuck in one of four places:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting started. </span>At first, building an email list can seem like a waste of time. When I started the DPS photography list I managed to collect 17 email addresses in the first week. (Well, 14 along with my own, my dad’s and my wife’s.) I remember thinking, “Is it really worth spending an hour putting together a newsletter for 14 people?” But I still did it, and the next week it was 30 people, and 45 the week after that. Now we have more than 700,000 subscribers. So <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/compare-blogger-email-service-providers/">choose an email service provider</a></span> and make a start.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collecting email addresses. </span>Many bloggers just have a widget in the sidebar. But there’s a lot more you can do to get people to subscribe. You can have calls to action in your content, you can use a tool such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://sumome.com/partner/problogger">SumoMe</a></span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=601672&amp;u=286361&amp;m=49337&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">OptinMonster</a></span> (which I covered in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-increase-your-email-list-subscribers-by-100-or-more-today/">episode 68 of the podcast</a></span>), or you could <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/69/">create a free opt-in</a></span> to give away to people who sign up.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sending emails. </span>Some bloggers collect email addresses but never send emails. Even if you’re waiting to have something to sell, you should still get into the rhythm of sending emails. Create and send useful content to your subscribers at least once a month – more if you can. On ProBlogger and Digital Photography School we send a weekly newsletter that lists the content published on the blog in that week, and sometimes a bit of bonus content as well.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automation.</span> Many bloggers manually put together every email they send out. That’s fine, but you can achieve so much more with a little automation. Set up a sequence of emails to get your readers on board and introduce them to your site. If that’s something you’re interested in learning more about, listen to episode 70 of the podcast: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-drive-traffic-and-profit-in-your-blogging-with-autoresponders/">How to Drive Traffic and Profit in Your Blogging with Autoresponders</a></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re stuck in one of those four areas, I encourage you to push through it during the next week. Start that list, collect email addresses more effectively, send emails regularly, or build some automation into your list. It can really lift your blog.</p>
<h2>#3: The Big Picture of Content</h2>
<p>A lot of bloggers are really good at creating daily or weekly content. But their system of creating content is often very much in the moment. They sit down, think about what to write about, write it, and then publish it.</p>
<p>One way to bring life to your blog is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/work-on-januarys-or-the-full-years-content-calendar/">create a content calendar</a></span>, or at least a list of content you want to produce over the upcoming weeks and months. This helps you to become more thoughtful with your content, and create content that takes readers on a journey.</p>
<p>I like to think of it as creating a pathway for your readers. What’s the path you want to take your readers on over the next few months?</p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/create-10-blog-post-ideas-for-your-blog-day-11-of-31-days-to-build-a-better-blog/">episode 11 of the podcast</a></span> I ran through a simple exercise that can help with this: creating a “before” and “after” profile for readers of your blog.</p>
<p>When readers come to you they’re in a particular situation, and you want to help them change. What do they need to know? What changes do they need to make? How could you inspire them? How can you help them gain the skills or the confidence they need?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">By mapping out the change you want to see in your readers, you can plan and create content that takes them on that journey.</span> Rather than just creating content that helps readers in the moment, you can give them the sense that you’ll be creating content that builds on this. That’s the type of content people will want to get more of, and that will drive them to subscribe and to become a regular reader of your blog.</p>
<p>So most bloggers could put more time into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Creating a “big picture” for their content</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d love to hear what you’ll be focusing on over the coming weeks. Let us know in the comments. And let us know what <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> think other bloggers should spend more time doing?</p>

<p>Do readers engage with your Facebook page?</p>
<p>A lot of people spend time on Facebook. And as bloggers, it makes sense that we want to reach them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s increasingly difficult to grow your audience using Facebook – especially if you don’t have the budget to boost posts or advertise.</p>
<p>But you can still use Facebook effectively without spending any money.</p>
<p>One thing that helps a lot is to build engagement with your existing followers. This will prompt Facebook to show your posts more widely.</p>
<h2>Why Engagement Matters So Much – And What it Looks Like</h2>
<p>As well as signalling to Facebook that people like what you’re posting (and that it should show your posts to more of your followers), high levels of engagement also mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>your readers will know you’re interested in them as people, and that you want to build a relationship with them</li>
<li>you’ll build social proof. If someone stumbles across your Facebook page and sees you’re engaging with your readers (and they’re engaging with you), they’re more likely to want to join in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get several different types of engagement, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>People liking your Facebook page</li>
<li>People reacting to your updates on Facebook (e.g. like, love, laugh, wow, sad, angry)</li>
<li>People sharing your posts with their followers, or in another page or group</li>
<li>People commenting on your posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one I like best is the comment. When readers leave comments, it gives you an opportunity to learn more about them. They’re not just going for the easy option of clicking “like”. They’re putting themselves out there and responding to your post.</p>
<p>This post is all about getting more comments on your Facebook page. And the most effective way I’ve found to do that (and not just on Facebook, but also on blog posts and any kind of social media) is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">ask questions.</span></p>
<p>That sounds obvious, right? But I’m amazed how many of the pages I follow <span style="font-style: italic;">never </span>ask questions. They never take the opportunity to get me commenting and engaging with them.</p>
<p>If you want to grow an audience of people who feel like they know, like and trust you, then you need to ask questions. But not just any questions. You need to ask the right types of questions.</p>
<h2>Nine Types of Question You Can Ask On Your Facebook Page</h2>
<h3>#1: “Fill in the Blank” Question</h3>
<p>This is a really easy (and often very effective) type of question to ask. Here’s a question I asked on the Digital Photography School Facebook page:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The lens attached to my main camera right now is _______.</span></p>
<p>For a blog such as ProBlogger I might ask:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">My first blogging platform was __________.</span></p>
<p>And for a food blog you might ask something like:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The word that describes my approach to diet is ____________.</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">My favourite comfort food is _______________.</span></p>
<p>The beauty of this type of question is that it’s incredibly simple for someone to answer. They just have to leave one word.</p>
<p>Asking a “fill in the blank” question is often a good way to get someone to leave their first comment – especially if they’ve been following your page for a while without commenting.</p>
<h3>#2: “This vs That” Question</h3>
<p>With this type of question, you get your followers to choose one of two options. It might be something like “Are you a cat or a dog person?”</p>
<p>On Digital Photography School we might ask, “Do you prefer Nikon or Canon?” or “Do you post-process your photos or not?”</p>
<p>You can also use this for a yes/no question such as, “Do you exercise daily? Yes or no”.</p>
<p>Be careful if your question is likely to spark a lively debate. We don’t ask about Nikon vs Canon too often because it can end up getting a bit negative. (Some people have very strong views about the brand they prefer.)</p>
<h3>#3: Question from a Reader</h3>
<p>This is a technique one of my online friends Samantha Jockel from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.schoolmum.net/">School Mum</a></span> uses. She’ll write a post like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-574742" src="https://i0.wp.com/problogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/school-mum-question.jpg?resize=516%2C303&#038;ssl=1" alt="School mum question" width="516" height="303" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/problogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/school-mum-question.jpg?w=516&amp;ssl=1 516w, https://i0.wp.com/problogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/school-mum-question.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/problogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/school-mum-question.jpg?resize=455%2C267&amp;ssl=1 455w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>These questions (which always start with “A School Mum asks”) are sometimes funny, sometimes start debates, and sometimes offer a way in to more controversial topics. And they often get a lot of comments.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any questions from readers, you might be able to create some by digging into:</p>
<ul>
<li>comments on your blog</li>
<li>comments left on your Facebook page</li>
<li>emails you’ve received.</li>
</ul>
<h3>#4: “Biggest Problems” Question</h3>
<p>While asking your readers to share their biggest problems, challenges, obstacles or even fears might seem a bit negative, you’ll be surprised what comes out in the discussion.</p>
<p>You can ask fairly specific things. For instance, on a parenting page there might be questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s your biggest fear as a parent?</li>
<li>What’s your biggest challenge at the moment in raising boys?</li>
<li>What’s the biggest problem you have in the area of discipline?</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of questions help you understand who’s following your page. They can also inform future pieces of content for your blog.</p>
<p>You may also find people mentioning problems you’ve written about in the past. You can reply to them and say, “Here’s an article with some tips on how to overcome that challenge”, and drive people back to your archives.</p>
<h3>#5: “Dreams” Question</h3>
<p>This is the flipside of #4. Ask people about their dreams and aspirations. It helps you understand not only what your readers are going through right now, but also what they want to do or become.</p>
<p>Again, you can use readers’ responses to create content that helps them move toward the dreams they have.</p>
<p>People love to talk about their dreams, ambitions and hopes for their future. So this type of question often gets a lot of comments.</p>
<h3>#6: “Tips” Question</h3>
<p>Although people are coming to your Facebook page to learn from you, the reality is that in any community there’s a lot of collective wisdom.</p>
<p>With this type of question you can say, “I want to hear from you today with your tips” about a particular area.</p>
<p>You may not get as many responses to this type of question as you would to a “fill in the blanks” question. But the responses will be deeper, longer, and more useful. They’ll be valuable both to you and your other readers.</p>
<p>And if you get permission from those who comment (which you can do by mentioning you plan on using some responses in a future blog post), you can also turn these answers into content for your blog. Just make sure you give credit to the people who left those comments.</p>
<h3>#7: “Share a Photo” Question</h3>
<p>While this won’t work for every type of site, asking readers to share a photo (or video) can be relevant to many Facebook pages.</p>
<p>We do this a lot on Digital Photography School, where we might ask people to upload their best portrait or landscape from the previous month. The result? A long list of photos, with many people not even leaving a comment.</p>
<p>This could work on many other types of blogs. Here are some I’ve seen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parenting blogger – “Show us a favourite piece of art from one of your kids.”</li>
<li>Food blogger – “Show us the last picture you took of food on your phone.”</li>
<li>Fashion blogger – “Show us your favourite pair of shoes.”</li>
<li>Technology blogger – “Show us everything you have in your laptop bag.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, you may not get as many comments as you would with other types of questions. But you’ll likely get some really interesting ones.</p>
<h3>#8: “Accountability” Question</h3>
<p>You’ll find this type of question used in a lot of Facebook groups, where they ask things like, <span style="font-style: italic;">“What’s your biggest goal of the week?” </span>or<span style="font-style: italic;"> “What do you want to achieve this week?”</span></p>
<p>This can be a great way to get engagement because it gives you the opportunity to respond to readers later in the week.</p>
<p>I left a comment on a post like this on a Monday. On the Friday the blogger left a reply to every single comment that mentioned a goal, asking, “How did you go with…?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t completed my goal. But I got it done about ten minutes after he left that comment. I was really grateful that blogger took the time to keep me accountable. And I know I’ll be going back to that page.</p>
<p>If your page involves people trying to build a habit, learn something or become something, you could ask this type of question and then come back to encourage them and help build some accountability.</p>
<h3>#9: Question About a Blog Post</h3>
<p>When you share a link to a blog post you’ve written, you can add a question. This can encourage readers to read your post as well as comment.</p>
<p>For instance, one post I shared a while back on Digital Photography School was <span style="font-style: italic;">The 19 Most Popular Compact System and Mirrorless Cameras With Our Readers</span>.</p>
<p>As well as posting the link to Facebook (which automatically pulled in the title and image from the post), I added a question: “Do you use one of these popular compact camera systems?”</p>
<p>My goal was to get people reading that blog post. But I also got lots of people answering the question. We don’t normally get many comments on our links to blog posts, but in this case 23 people answered the question. That particular Facebook post also had a higher-than-average reach.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve already tried some of these types of questions on your Facebook page. The key is to get into the habit of asking questions regularly, and mixing up the types of questions you use.</p>
<h2>Final Tips for Using Questions on Your Facebook Page</h2>
<p>Finally, here are some things to keep in mind when asking questions on your Facebook page:</p>
<h3>#1: Stay On Topic</h3>
<p>Make sure your questions relate to your topic. Occasional off-topic questions can help build engagement, but don’t do it too regularly or readers may feel your page topic is getting lost.</p>
<h3>#2: Consider Using an Image</h3>
<p>Using an image helps your question stand out in people’s newsfeeds. It could be a plain image, or an image that includes the question text. Spending a minute or two doing this can really boost engagement.</p>
<h3>#3: Consider Using Facebook Live</h3>
<p>Facebook Lives get more reach than other types of post. So you may want to go on Facebook live and ask your readers a question. Once your live video is over, it will appear in people’s Facebook feeds as a replay.</p>
<h3>#4: Time Your Questions Appropriately</h3>
<p>Don’t ask questions at the wrong time of day. The other day a question popped into my mind, and I shared it at 3.30pm Australian time. That’s the middle of the night in America (where most of my audience is), and my Aussie audience is picking up their kids from school or about to go home from work. Not many of my readers are online at that time of day.</p>
<h3>#5: Don’t Ask Too Many Questions</h3>
<p>Mix up the types of post that you publish. Share links, videos, pictures, and so on as well as questions. Facebook seems to prefer this, and it’s likely to be better for reader engagement too.</p>
<h3>#6: Be as Responsive As You Can</h3>
<p>If people answer your question, it’s really nice if they get a response from you. They’ve taken the time to respond to you, so take some time to respond to them. That doesn’t always need to be with a comment. You might use a “like” or other response, particularly if they left a “yes”/“no” or single-word comment.</p>
<h3>#7: Be Quite Specific With Your Questions</h3>
<p>Don’t be too open ended with your questions. You’re likely to get much better responses if your questions are fairly focused. You want to make it as easy as possible for people to comment, and if your questions are too open ended they may not know how to respond.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you come up with lots of ideas for questions you could ask on your Facebook page to build engagement. Of course, you don’t have to limit your use of questions to Facebook pages. You can use them in Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups, on Twitter, or even on your blog.</p>
<p>Seen people using any other types of questions on Facebook or other social media? Let us know about them in the comments.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/3-key-things-bloggers-do-to-grow-their-blogs-into-businesses/">episode 192</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast. </span></p>
<p>A couple of years ago we published a fantastic guest post from John Stevens on <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/the-9-conversion-habits-of-the-worlds-most-successful-bloggers/">the nine conversion habits of the world’s most successful bloggers</a></span>.</p>
<p>To build a business around your blog you probably need to work on certain things. And John’s post highlights some great habits to build.</p>
<p>But in this post I want to pull out three things John talks about that can make a real difference to your blog. And once we’ve gone through them I’ll share some fundamentals that are even more crucial.</p>
<h2>#1: Use Multiple Email Opt-In Boxes</h2>
<p>Email is so important. It can help you sell to your audience, build traffic, and build a sense of community.</p>
<p>As John says in his post, you shouldn’t have just the one opportunity for people to opt in to your email list on your blog (or even a page of your blog). The most successful bloggers have <span style="font-style: italic;">multiple</span> calls to action on every page of their blog to opt in.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Readers are becoming increasingly blind to our opt-in invites.</span> It’s like the “ad blindness” that came after banner ads were first introduced in 2004–05. At first they got lots of clicks, but now we’re so used to them that we barely notice them (and ignore them if we do).</p>
<p>Opt-in blindness is similar. People see so many invitations to sign up for freebies that they’ll often just ignore them.</p>
<p>I don’t believe we should stop using email opt-ins. But we <i>should</i> get smarter about how we use them. Having multiple opt-ins is one way to do it, although as John says in his article it’s important to find a balance. You don’t want to annoy your readers by bombarding them with pop-ups that interrupt their reading.</p>
<p>But you can certainly have more than one call to action. For example, you could have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a “welcome mat” that slides down from the top when someone comes to your site for the first time</li>
<li>a call to action at the bottom of your blog posts</li>
<li>an “exit pop-up” that appears as someone leaves your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Track whether sign-ups increase (or decrease) based on the options you have in place. For instance, back in 2017 on Digital Photography School we found that adding an exit pop-up boosted our sign-ups by 30–40%.</p>
<p>Some tools we recommend to help you with opt-ins on your blog include <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=601672&amp;u=286361&amp;m=49337&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">Opt-in Monster</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://sumome.com/partner/problogger">SumoMe</a></span>.</p>
<h2>#2: Use the Space Above the Fold Effectively</h2>
<p>“Above the fold” means the area of a page that appears before you need to scroll (on a desktop). Everything that you can’t see until you scroll is “below the fold”.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The area above the fold on your front page is really important because people are more likely to notice and take action on the things you place here.</span> Here are some of the key things you can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefit statements – what someone will get from reading your site</li>
<li>Social profile – such as how many social media followers or email list subscribers you have</li>
<li>Opt-in calls – where you ask someone to enter their email address</li>
<li>Proof of authority – maybe showing the logos of sites you’ve been featured on.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as the space above the fold on your front page, think about what’s happening on your posts themselves. Most new readers will come straight to a blog post, not the front page.</p>
<p>A potential problem is having so much stuff above the fold on your blog posts that readers can’t actually see the content of the post without subscribing. For instance, there may be a huge email opt-in at the top.</p>
<p>While a few people may willingly give you their email address before reading your post, it’s smarter to show them the post first and <span style="font-style: italic;">then </span>ask for it. You want to start delivering value to them straight away.</p>
<h2>#3: Use a Static Homepage to Gather Email Addresses</h2>
<p>This has shifted a lot over the past few years of blogging. When I started my first blog in 2002, it looked like 99% of the blogs on the internet. If you went to the front page you’d see the 5 to 10 most recent posts in their entirety, with the most recent at the top.</p>
<p>That’s just how things were.</p>
<p>A couple of years later people started showing excerpts rather than full articles. While readers then had to click to read each article, it made for a better user experience because the front page didn’t take so long to load.</p>
<p>Later, we started seeing front pages that were more like magazines, with a grid-like layout. Some would have just the title and image for a post, while others would have a short excerpt.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But recently we’ve seen front pages that don’t look like blogs at all. </span>They’re more like landing pages that funnel readers toward taking specific actions. And as John picks up on in his article, many of those pages focus on getting people to subscribe to their email list.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong when it comes to designing your home page. But if you look at John’s post you’ll see a lot of blogs no longer look like blogs in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Think about your number one goal and focus on that above the fold on your homepage. Then add some really strong calls to action. You can certainly include your latest content there, but you can include other things as well.</p>
<p>For instance, on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/">ProBlogger front page</a></span> we have prominent calls to subscribe to our email list at the top and at the bottom. In between we highlight our most recent blog posts and podcasts, and have information about our courses (plus another link to our email opt-in as ProBlogger PLUS).</p>
<p>So these three things can all make a big difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>having multiple opt-ins</li>
<li>using the space above the fold effectively on your home page while ensuring your blog posts deliver value straight away</li>
<li>having a static home page that lists more than just content.</li>
</ul>
<p>But many successful bloggers <span style="font-style: italic;">don’t</span> do them all. They make a great income, but their sites look a little dated and they aren’t doing anything innovative with their design.</p>
<p>So why do they succeed?</p>
<p>I think it comes down to three key factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">They create lots of great content</span> on a regular basis that answers questions and solves problems. They’re delivering real value to readers.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">They engage with their audience through social media</span>, answering questions but also simply getting to know them.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">They promote what they do</span> consistently and prolifically. They network, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/find-pitch-guest-posting-opportunities/">guest post</a></span>, attend events and conferences, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/how-to-approach-influencers-in-your-niche/">get to know other key influencers</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the design of your blog and how people use it is important and can make a real difference, it’s not the whole picture. In fact, the key to your success will be relentlessly creating great content, being highly engaging, and promoting yourself.</p>
<p>So by all means add more opt-ins to your site, check what you’re including above the fold, and have a clear goal for your homepage. But don’t do it at the expense of your content, your audience, and your promotion.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear what you think about this. What do you believe makes the biggest difference? What are you personally drawn to? Do you prefer tweaking the design of your blog or writing more posts? Share your thoughts in the comments area below.</p>

<p>Do you struggle with managing your time?</p>
<p>As an online entrepreneur it’s easy to slip into bad habits – moving frantically from one urgent thing to another, or responding to other people’s agendas without much thought about what <span style="font-style: italic;">we</span> need to get done.</p>
<p>In this post, I’m sharing six things that have helped me form good habits in my blogging, my business, and many aspects of my life.</p>
<h2>What if you’re not naturally organised?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I’m not a naturally organized person.</span></p>
<p>I’m quite impulsive and don’t like to be pigeon-holed. The rest of my team are the opposite: they love spreadsheets, things being organised, and so on.</p>
<p>But despite not being naturally organised, over the years I’ve managed to build certain systems, habits, and routines to help me get things done.</p>
<p>Because without these these types of routines I knew my business would always be limited.</p>
<h2>Six productivity tips that will help, no matter how disorganised you are</h2>
<h3>#1: Start with your goals and your “why”</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There’s no point building good habits unless you have a clear “why” – your motivation to making those habits stick.</span></p>
<p>A good example is my health journey over the past few years. At various points I’ve tried to build better habits around diet, exercise, sleep, and so on. But I never kept them going for long. I understood what I was doing on a “head” level, but didn’t really have a “heart” connection to them.</p>
<p>But for several years now I’ve been walking 10,000 steps almost every day. I’ve also been eating healthier, and consistently going to the gym.</p>
<p>What changed? At the beginning of 2015 I realised I was in a slump. I wasn’t as healthy as I wanted to be physically, emotionally, socially or spiritually.</p>
<p>Some of my early goals were about losing weight and increasing my movement. So as well as having the “why”, I took specific steps toward my goals.</p>
<h3>#2: Tell yourself “It’s just what I do”</h3>
<p>I don’t remember where I got this mantra from. But I’ve found it really helpful when I’m trying to build a new habit.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I say to myself, “It’s just what I do”.</span></p>
<p>Building good habits often meets with resistance for me when I’m tempted to eat something unhealthy or skip my walk. But one thing I do when I come up against that resistance is to say “It’s just what I do”.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Walking. It’s just what I do.”
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">“Eating healthy. It’s just what I do.”</span></p>
<p>In the early days of a goal that doesn’t come easily. Your mantra might not sound convincing at all. But the longer u stick with your habit, the more the mantra becomes true. The first day I walked 10,000 steps I’d only done it once. A week later I’d done it seven days in a row, and my mantra of “It’s just what I do” had far more truth to it.</p>
<h3>#3: Schedule the thing you’re trying to normalise</h3>
<p>When I started walking every day I put it in my diary. I set an alarm for each weekday at 12.30pm that said “Walk”.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making an appointment with myself helped make walking a normal part of my day</span>.</p>
<p>I started arranging my workday around the walk because it was in my diary. And then after a while I no longer needed the alarm because my body started anticipating the walk. And if I <span style="font-style: italic;">didn’t</span> go for a walk, I’d start feeling a bit edgy.</p>
<h3>#4: Start with small things and level up</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most of my good habits started off small. </span></p>
<p>For instance, when I started making health changes I began by eating healthily. Then I added in walking, and later working at a standing desk.</p>
<p>With the standing desk, I decided that to begin with I’d just spend the first hour of each work day standing, then I’d sit down.</p>
<p>Once I got used to that, I did an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon. Then I did it for the entire morning and an hour later in the afternoon. Now I spend most of my day standing.</p>
<p>If your goal is to write a daily blog post, going from no posts at all to writing a post every day might be too much. Perhaps you could do one post a week, then two, then three, and so on. The same goes for other goals, such as running a podcast or even using social media.</p>
<h3>#5: Never miss two in a row</h3>
<p>Earlier I mentioned my mantra of “it’s just what I do”. Another mantra I have is “Never miss two in a row”.</p>
<p>That means that if something gets in the way of one of my habits (or I just need a break) I give myself permission to have time away from my routine. But I try not to miss two in a row.</p>
<p>For instance, if I miss walking one day I try hard not to miss the second day. With going to the gym, which I normally do twice a week, I’ll just do it once if I’m away.</p>
<p>With my blog, I might write half a post while travelling when I’d normally write a full one.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The key here is to find ways to keep my habits going, even if not at the frequency I’d normally aim for.</span></p>
<p>The times when I run into trouble is when I have an extended break away from things.</p>
<h3>#6: Create space to play</h3>
<p>Make sure you schedule time to do things for fun. For me that might be reading a novel, watching something on Netflix, going to a movie or a cafe, or just having a nap.</p>
<p>I do some of this at the end of the day. But I also set aside Monday afternoons for it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I think most of us need time in our weekly schedule for rest, play, dreaming and imagining. </span>It gives us a chance to get more energy and new ideas. So if you want to be productive, you need to build these things in as well.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to build healthy habit, in your blogging or your life, I suggest you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with your goals and your “why”</li>
<li>Tell yourself “It’s just what I do”</li>
<li>Schedule the thing you’re trying to normalise</li>
<li>Start with small things and level up</li>
<li>Never miss two in a row</li>
<li>Create space to play</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-juggling-family-life-and-blogging/">episode 148</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger Podcast.</span></p>
<p>One of the things that attracted me to blogging was the flexibility it offered. I’d be able to work and still be involved in my family and raising my kids.</p>
<p>Before we had kids, my wife Vanessa and I planned for us both to work part-time and look after the kids together.</p>
<p>But we had no idea what blogging would lead to. And as it turned out things didn’t quite turn out the way we expected. I ended up blogging full time, and Vanessa became the primary caregiver along with doing some part-time work.</p>
<h2>The Advantages of Blogging When You Have a Family</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Although I work full time on my blogging, I can still be very involved with our family life.</span> I’m here when the kids leave for school. And when they return I try to greet them at the door and connect with them for at least a few minutes.</p>
<p>It also means I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>drop them off and pick them up when needed</li>
<li>volunteer in the classroom from time to time</li>
<li>make it to mid-week school concerts and activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Fridays are a good example. For years I’ve been taking one of my three boys to a local cafe before school every Friday for some one-on-one time to do homework, share a reading book, and have a chat over hot chocolate.</p>
<p>Blogging also lets us travel a lot as a family. We can be on the road for a month, and I can still get some work done.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many people start blogging during a time of transition within their family. </span>They might be home with small children for the first time after having a professional career, and want to use some of their skills in a way that fits around their family.</p>
<p>So there are lots of advantages to blogging when it comes to family. But there are challenges too.</p>
<p>I’m no expert at this. At times my family life and work life get out of balance one way or the other. But here are some lessons I’ve learned along the way.</p>
<h2>Lesson #1: Set Aside Time for Your Business and Time for Your Family</h2>
<p>It can be tempting to blog while doing family stuff. And sometimes that’s necessary. Maybe you’re blogging while the kids are watching a movie, or while you’re supervising them. But I’ve discovered I’m a much better parent when I’m 100% focused on my kids. And I’m a much better blogger when I’m 100% focused on my blog.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t be 100% focused on one or the other <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the time, try to carve out <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> times for total focus.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my family is my top priority. But to provide for them need an income. That means my business also needs to be a high priority for me. And it’s something I enjoy doing as well.</p>
<p>My schedule has shifted at different times and at different life stages, but here’s how it’s typically looked for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before 9am I’m 100% focused on my family.</li>
<li>Between 9am and 5pm I’m 100% focused on my business.</li>
<li>From 5pm to 7.30/8pm I’m 100% focused on my family, particularly the kids.</li>
<li>After 7.30/8pm I spend time with Vanessa. (That being said, two or three nights a week we’ll sit on the couch next to each other and work, and maybe have the television on in the background.)</li>
</ul>
<p>My time on the weekends is pretty much dedicated to family.</p>
<p>That’s how it works for us. But sometimes things run a little differently day to day, and we’re flexible depending on what else is happening.</p>
<h2>Lesson #2: Be As Organised As You Possibly Can Be</h2>
<p>During the times when you’re 100% focused on your work, it’s important to be organised and focused. I often get more done when I only have a half day than when I have a whole day because I have to focus on what really matters.</p>
<p>I could share loads of different tips about organisation. But for me it really boils down to <span style="font-weight: bold;">working out what’s important, making a list, and ticking off those things.</span></p>
<p>If you have to juggle kids and work, think through what activities you can do at different times. I find creating content really hard when the kids are in the room with me. But I might do some administrative things such as email or social media while they’re watching TV or playing happily.</p>
<h2>Lesson #3: Talk About Your Work Boundaries</h2>
<p>Your schedule will only work if you communicate it with those around you. In our family, Vanessa and I normally work out the boundaries of how our family will run. Sometimes we ask our kids and involve them when we can on making those decisions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As my kids get older, I’m trying to have more conversations about my business and what my work involves</span>. I tell them about the podcast episode I’ve been recording, or the work I’ve been doing.</p>
<p>I also talk about <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> I work. I tell them that I enjoy it, that I’m trying to help other people, and that it makes money for our family.</p>
<h2>Lesson #4: Set Up Signals to Show You’re Focusing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I try to have signals and reminders for the kids, particularly about when I’m focused on my work.</span> At home, I work in my office. And if I’m there, it’s a signal to the kids that I’m at work. (I sometimes work on the couch at night once they’re in bed.)</p>
<p>This helps me for a couple of reasons. First, it eliminates some of the distractions that come with working in family areas. Second, it lets me shut the door so the kids know not to interrupt unless it’s an emergency. I keep the door open quite a bit when they’re home and I’m happy for them to disturb me.</p>
<p>Occasionally they ignore it and burst in while I’m doing a webinar in front of a thousand people. (It&#8217;s happened a few times.) But most of the time it works.</p>
<p>I know people who have other signals for their family. A friend of mine puts on a shirt and tie when he’s working. He has to work in a family area because they have a small house, and so this is a signal to his family that he’s trying to work.</p>
<p>Another person I know puts a sign on their office door that will either say “I’m at work” or “Come and say Hi”.</p>
<h2>Lesson #5: Work Outside the Home At Times</h2>
<p>Over the years, I’ve found there are times when it’s hard to work at home. For a long time I worked in cafes. I liked the white noise and the semi-social nature of having other people around. I’ve also found our local library a nice environment to work in.</p>
<p>More recently, I hired a room in a local church for me and my team to work in, mostly on Friday mornings. I also have a nearby co-working space where I can use the wifi, printer, coffee machine, and so on.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixing up my working environment gets me away from some of the distractions at home and helps me be more creative</span>, particularly if I’m working on a big project such as an ebook or a keynote.</p>
<h2>Lesson #6: Capture Ideas on the Run</h2>
<p>While I try to separate blogging and family times, II get all kinds of ideas and inspiration while I’m with the family. I used to carry a little notebook around to record these, but now I use Evernote and other apps on my phone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If I don’t capture ideas straight away, I forget about them.</span> But once I’ve recorded them I can focus on my family and retrieve them once I’m back in work mode.</p>
<h2>Lesson #7: Take Extended Time Away from Blogging</h2>
<p>While it’s great to be able to blog on the road or while taking a long vacation, it’s also important to have extended periods where you can dedicate yourself to family and other things in life.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I try to have three or four weeks a year when I don’t check my blog at all.</span> Two of those weeks are usually over the Christmas break, which is in the summer here in Australia. We usually go down to the beach for a couple of weeks. Not only do I get to enjoy time with my family and unwind, I also come back fresher, which is good for my business.</p>
<p>This can be especially important if you blog about travel or your family. There can be a tension around this, where every experience gets turned into content. But it’s important to create memories as well as content when you’re away.</p>
<h2>Lesson #8: Delegate and Outsource</h2>
<p>Over the past few years I’ve been able to involve other people in some of the work in my business. This has taken time, and you obviously need some income before you can start hiring people. But if you’re at that point, consider paying people to help you.</p>
<p>For many years – probably the first eight or so years of my blogging – I tried to do it all. I had to be online constantly &#8212; monitoring comments, and even receiving alerts in the middle of the night if my server went down.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One of the best things I ever did was to start getting other people to help me with my blogging. </span>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-manage-incoming-email-tips-tools-and-techniques/">episode 147</a></span> of the podcast I talked about hiring my brother-in-law Simon to help me with customer support emails. This freed up a lot of my timeto focus on the things I’m best at in my business.</p>
<p>As well as getting help with your blog, you might consider getting help in other areas of your life. That might mean paying for childcare, a cleaner, or someone to help with the garden. Things that could help you find more time to not only work on your business but also spend with your family.</p>
<h2>Lesson #9: Make Peace With the Tension Between Blogging and Family Life</h2>
<p>It’s probably healthy to feel a sense of tension. We have a limited amount of time, and it’s good to be mindful about how we spend it.</p>
<p>The key for me is to keep my priorities in mind and communicate them. There will be times when things are out of balance. That can potentially be a good thing, so long as you are aware of it and can find ways to rectify it.</p>
<p>How do you juggle your business, family life, and everything else? Even if you don’t have kids, it can be a struggle. I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>What does it take to make a full-time living for your blog?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I know some bloggers who managed it with hundreds of daily readers, while others needed tens of thousands of daily readers. </span></p>
<p>The amount of money you make from your traffic depends things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the monetization model you have</li>
<li>the income streams you use</li>
<li>your readership, and how engaged they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>But no matter how much you need, more traffic is generally better. And more income definitely is.</p>
<p>To grow your traffic and increase your income I suggest setting some goals for yourself, which is what I’ve been doing for a decade and a half now.</p>
<h2>How I Started Setting Goals for My Blogging</h2>
<p>Back in 2004, when I’d been blogging for about 18 months, I started experimenting with AdSense and Amazon’s affiliate program. I wanted to know how much traffic it would take for me to go full time.</p>
<p>Google Analytics wasn’t around at the time. However, using a tool called Site Meter I could view the stats of both my own blog and other people’s. And I fell into the trap of comparing my traffic and my income to that of other bloggers.</p>
<p>It was depressing and frustrating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So instead I started comparing my monthly traffic against that of the previous month</span>, and set myself the goal to having my traffic increase each time.</p>
<p>To begin with my goal was to simply increase it, no matter how much that increase was. But as I repeated the exercise I realized my blog was growing naturally by about 5% each month.</p>
<p>At this point I began setting specific goals. The first was to increase my traffic by 10% each month. If I had 3,000 visitors in the first month, I wanted 3,300 the next month, then 3,630, then 3,993, and so on.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was easy to hit that 10% increase. Sometimes I hit 30%. Other months, 10% seemed impossible. But having that figure in my mind meant I could always see whether I was on track.</p>
<p>I did something similar with my income, which at the time was largely from AdSense. I realized that if I could increase my traffic by 10% every month my AdSense income would generally go up by 10% too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">That being said, I set my earnings goal at 15% increase each month.</span> One obvious way to increase earnings was to increase the traffic on my site. But I found I could go further than that by positioning the ads better, changing the design of the ads, and so on.</p>
<p>I also started adding other income streams. I focused more on Amazon’s affiliate program, and started experimenting with other advertising networks (such as Chitika) and selling ads direct to advertisers. I found that 15% was quite achievable for me, and some months I managed a 30%, 50% or even 100% increase.</p>
<h2>How to Set Your Own Goals for Your Blog</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When it comes to traffic and income, don’t compare yourself with other bloggers. Instead, compare your stats for this month with your stats for last month.</span> (Or, if you’ve been blogging for a while, compare April this year with April last year.)</p>
<p>Aim to increase your traffic and income each month. You might aim for a 10% or 15% increase like I did. Or depending on the stage you’re at in your blog’s lifecycle you might aim for 40%, 50% or more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can use this technique for other metrics, too. </span>For instance, you might try to improve your bounce rate, or increase the number of pages viewed. On social media you might look at the number of new followers you’re getting, or the number of new newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you want each month to be better than the previous month. Try to set goals that are not only realistic but also stretch you a bit. Even if you don’t quite reach them, having that goal in mind will help you go further than you would have otherwise.</p>
<h2>How to Reach Your Goals</h2>
<p>Just setting goals won’t get you far. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You need to be specific about how you’ll achieve them.</span></p>
<p>For instance, if you want to get 10% more traffic each month ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;What blogs will I guest post on?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What forums will I start interacting with?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What influencers will I reach out to?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Who will I email to share links to the things I’ve written?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What shareable content will I create?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Each month, try to come up with three or four things you’ll do to get closer to your goal.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/the-secrets-of-making-money-blogging/">episode 133</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast.</span></p>
<p>In interviews I often get asked something like, “What’s your number one secret to making money online?”</p>
<p>That’s a hard question to answer, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">ultimately there’s no one ‘secret’ and no single way to make money online</span>. People use lots of different methods, and in this post I’ll be taking a quick look at some of them.</p>
<p>Blogging isn’t a ‘get rich quick’ scheme. And you need to stick with it for a while before you’ll see any results. But whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been blogging for months or even years, these seven tips should help.</p>
<h2>#1: Choose a Topic You Really Love</h2>
<p>If you’re starting a new blog, pick a topic or niche you genuinely love and are passionate about.</p>
<p>This has several crucial benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes it much easier to stick with your blog for the long term</li>
<li>Your enthusiasm will help readers feel drawn to your content</li>
<li>It helps you create products that people will buy because you know what they’ll enjoy</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> make money from an area that doesn’t interest you. But it’s a lot easier to do it if you’re blogging about something you really like.</p>
<h2>#2: Be as Useful as You Possibly Can</h2>
<p>Make your content and your products as useful as possible. Or, as my son told me once, “Tell the world something important”.</p>
<p>You can make money online by doing things that <span style="font-style: italic;">aren’t </span>useful or important. You can even do it by ripping people off. But it’s much more satisfying and sustainable to build a real business that’s useful to your customers.</p>
<h2>#3: Be Confident About Putting Yourself and Your Products Forward</h2>
<p>Some bloggers find it really hard to sell themselves or what they do. But while it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> difficult, you must learn how to do it. You need to be able to make offers and approach potential partners confidently.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you need to hype everything up. A quiet confidence can work really well.</p>
<h2>#4: Diversify What You Do</h2>
<p>Don’t just focus on one income stream. Find ways to diversify so that if something doesn’t work out too well you’ve got other options.</p>
<p>That might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diversifying the topics you write about. </span>I’ve got two long-running blogs : <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://digital-photography-school.com/">Digital Photography School</a></span> and ProBlogger. Perhaps you have more than one blog as well. And if one isn’t going well at a particular point, the other(s) could back it up.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diversifying your income streams.</span> I don’t rely on just one area (e.g. ads or selling ebooks). I try to create multiple income streams so that if one falls over or takes a while to take off, I have others supplementing my income. Another option is to have a day job that brings in money while you’re getting your blog going.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#5: Take a Long-Term View</h2>
<p>There have been times when I’ve made money fast on the internet. But it usually came after two or three years of hard work building relationships with readers and producing content for free.</p>
<p>Try seeing the time, energy and even money you put into your blog as an investment. Hopefully, it’ll pay off one day. But don’t expect it to happen immediately.</p>
<h2>#6: Treat Making Money as a Business, Not an Event</h2>
<p>Making money online might feel like it’s an event, such as a product launch. But for most online entrepreneurs it’s a long-term business where they’re creating something that grows over time.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re doing affiliate marketing you’ll be building systems that continually promote products to your readers (perhaps by using an auto-responder).</p>
<p>Think strategically about what you’ll be doing and how you’ll be monetizing your blog. Simply building a blog that gets traffic won’t make money for you.</p>
<h2>#7: Create Your Own Products</h2>
<p>Don’t rely on advertising revenue or affiliate income where you promote other people’s products. Instead, work towards having products of your own to sell. Develop systems around those products to sell them – not just at the launch, but on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>This could be an information product (such as an ebook or online course), a physical product, or a service you offer such as consulting or speaking.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">None of these things are new. I first talked about them in a video I created back in 2010.</span> But they all work, and if you follow them you’ll have a great chance of making money from blogging.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-build-hundreds-links-to-your-blog-in-5-minutes-a-day/">episode 159</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast.</span></p>
<p>Incoming links to your blog are vital. They not only drive traffic to your blog from other websites and blogs but also help you rank higher in search engines, which again leads to more traffic.</p>
<p>The method I&#8217;m about to explain is a simple but powerful one. I got it from a BuzzSumo post, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://buzzsumo.com/blog/simple-tip-gained-us-200-backlinks/">The Simple Tip That Gained Us Over 200 Backlinks</a></span>. And they got it from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://syedbalkhi.com/">Syed Balkhi</a></span> from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.wpbeginner.com/">WPBeginner</a></span>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the quick version:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Look for mentions of your blog (or keywords that are relevant to your blog) on other people&#8217;s blogs. Reach out to them to see if there&#8217;s an opportunity for them to link to you.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not rocket science, but it really does work. And here’s the system I use to do this in just a few minutes each day.</p>
<h2>Monitor Your Keywords Using a Tool Like BuzzSumo</h2>
<p>I use the paid version of BuzzSumo to do this, but there are other tools such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://mention.com">Mention</a></span> and the free <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.google.co.uk/alerts">Google Alerts</a></span>.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;Monitoring&#8221; tab of BuzzSumo I monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li>My brand names (ProBlogger and Digital Photography School)</li>
<li>Keywords that are relevant to my niche.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you put those words in place, BuzzSumo monitors thousands of blogs and creates a daily report showing any new content that uses these words.</p>
<p>With the keywords, you need to choose ones that are fairly specific and put them in quotes (e.g. &#8220;food photography&#8221;) or the results will be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Think about the key articles on your site that you&#8217;d like to build links to – articles that will be particularly helpful to people. Think about keywords that could relate to those. Start with two or three articles, and some relevant keywords for each.</p>
<p>Then go through the reports every day (or once or twice a week if you want to do it in a larger batch) and look at the list of content.</p>
<h2>What to Look For When Monitoring Your Brand Name and Keywords</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re monitoring your brand name and keywords, your outreach will depend on what was mentioned.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mentions of your brand name. </span>These may not relate to your blog specifically (e.g. sometimes people use the term &#8220;problogger&#8221; to describe blogging professionally rather than to reference my blog), but often they do. The BuzzSumo report will tell you whether there&#8217;s a link in the post to your site or not, which is really useful.</p>
<p>If someone mentions your brand and they don&#8217;t link to you, send them a polite email saying something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for mentioning [the name of your blog]. I really found it interesting to read. [You can add something personal here about their article]. Would you mind linking back to my article that you mentioned? You know, every link helps!&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t do this every single time someone mentions ProBlogger. But in some cases I can see there&#8217;s a good opportunity to get a link, such as when they mention a specific article.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mentions of relevant keywords. </span>If your blog is fairly new, your brand probably won&#8217;t get mentioned a lot. In that case keyword monitoring will be more useful to you, where you keep an eye out for opportunities to invite someone to link to your site.</p>
<h2>How This Works in Practice</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example. One keyword I monitor is &#8220;food photography&#8221;. I found an article on a parenting blog where the blogger shared some recipes and some photos of the food. They apologised for the photos not being as good as they could be, and mentioning they wanted to learn how to improve their food photography.</p>
<p>I sent them an email saying I thought their post was really good, and that their photos were pretty good as well. I gave them a couple of links to some articles we&#8217;ve written on the topic of food photography.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t ask for a link. I just wanted to be helpful. And I had no idea who the blogger was. We&#8217;d had no previous contact whatsoever.</p>
<p>They replied a few hours later to say thanks. And I went back to the article to see they&#8217;d updated it with a couple of the links I sent them.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a week later they wrote an entire article about photography. Not only did they mention the food photography links, they also wrote about taking photos of kids and linked to some of our posts on that.</p>
<p>This led to an ongoing conversation between us by email. And now they&#8217;ve asked us to write a guest post for their site.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opportunities open up when people mention things that are relevant to you, particularly things you can help them with.</span></p>
<h2>Directly Asking for a Link</h2>
<p>Sometimes I&#8217;ve been a little bit more cheeky and specifically asked for links where we have a relevant article.</p>
<p>For instance, I read a post a couple of weeks ago on a blog about dogs, called &#8220;Three Tips for Beginners Photographing Dogs&#8221;. It was a short, simple article that was ideal for beginners. I emailed to say it was a great article and I loved the images in it. And I shared a couple of links to articles we&#8217;d published on the same topic that were at a more intermediate level.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I made it clear there was no pressure for them to use those links in their post</span>. I just thought they might be useful to the blogger and/or their readers. I try to tread very gently with these emails, because I don&#8217;t want to seem spammy.</p>
<p>But in this case the blogger thanked me and added a couple of those links within a few hours.</p>
<h2>How Many Opportunities Should You Follow Up?</h2>
<p>Some of the reports I get from BuzzSumo contain 20 or 30 different pieces of content that mention my keywords. And I probably act on around four of these each day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When choosing which bloggers to contact, I look for pieces where I can really add value. </span>And I try to tailor my approach to every situation. It&#8217;s really important to pick and choose carefully, rather than emailing everyone indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Even a few links a day add up. If I get three or four links a day, that&#8217;s 100 a month or 1,200 new links every year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a good idea to monitor keywords associated with your blog even if you don&#8217;t send out any emails. It lets you see what other people are writing about the same topics, which can give you both ideas for content and avenues to build relationships with other bloggers.</p>
<h2>Making Time for Link Building (and Taking it Further)</h2>
<p>This link building tip works best when you can build it into your routine. You could set aside five or ten minutes each day, or perhaps half an hour in a specific time slot each week.</p>
<p>It might be a good task to do when you&#8217;re not feeling particularly creative, but have some time to tackle an administrative task.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&#8217;t have to contact people by email. You might find sending them a message on Facebook or shooting them a tweet works just as well (or even better). This might seem like a less spammy way to begin the conversation.</p>

<p>“All things being equal, people will do business with and refer business to those people that they know, like, and trust.” – Bob Burg</p>
<p>A big reason many businesses start blogs is to build trust with customers so they can drive sales.</p>
<p>If we look at our own spending habits, we don’t just make purchasing decisions based on features or price. We also make decisions based on whether we:</p>
<ul>
<li>feel a connection to the brand</li>
<li>trust the brand</li>
<li>like the people selling (or creating) the product.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Over many years, I’ve found that blogging and podcasting are great ways to build a connection with potential customers. </span></p>
<p>When you create regular content that changes the lives of those who read it, over time people will come to know you, like you, and trust you.</p>
<p>So how can you speed up the process of getting your readers (or your listeners) to trust you?</p>
<p>Before we dig into that, here are two important things you need to keep in mind.</p>
<h2>#1: Building Trust Will Take Time</h2>
<p>It’s important to realise that building trust takes time. Most of us don’t instantly warm up to someone the first time we meet them. It happens slowly over time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So don’t try to build trust fast on your blog: it’s not sustainable.</span> Instead, think about building a solid foundation.</p>
<p>When I blog, I know a single post or podcast is unlikely to have a reader trusting me completely. It’s better to take things step by step.</p>
<h2>#2: You Need to Earn Your Readers’ Trust</h2>
<p>Think about the people you trust most in real life. Why do you trust them?</p>
<p>For me, it’s about all the little interactions I’ve had with them – the times they’ve been generous, dependable, honest, accountable, vulnerable, or true to their word.</p>
<p>The same goes for blogging. It’s little things over time that get readers to trust you. It’s your track record of creating useful content that serves those who read it, and the consistency and dependability of your message.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Think about the value you can bring readers, and spend your time creating content that makes people’s lives better</span>, whether it’s through your blog, a podcast or a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Every time you sit down to write, ask yourself, “How am I going to change the life of my reader today?” It doesn’t need to be in a big way. You might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give them some new information</li>
<li>Share the latest news in your niche, or apply it to their situation</li>
<li>Help them realise they’re not alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>These can all change people’s lives in small ways. And if you keep writing that type of content, over time you’ll build a real connection and earn your reader’s trust.</p>
<p>So you want their trust to come about naturally. Having said that, here are a couple of ways you can nudge the process along a little.</p>
<h2>Tip #1: What Other People Say About You Counts a Lot</h2>
<p>If my wife Vanessa introduces me to someone she knows, likes and trusts I’m more open to trusting that person, even though I may not <span style="font-style: italic;">immediately</span> trust them. And I’ll have more peace of mind entering into that relationship.</p>
<p>The same happens online. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You might have heard about this “social proof”. And you’ve probably experienced it yourself at some point. </span></p>
<p>For instance, you’re more likely to read a blog that’s active and has lots of readers than one that clearly has very few readers. There’s an element of social proof there.</p>
<p>To harness this power you might focus on building community and engagement with your readers. When you’ve got a warm community, people will be more open to trusting you because they can see that a lot of people already trust you.</p>
<p>Another way to get this type of social proof is having people of influence interact with you, talk about you, or trust you in some public way. It might be through interviewing influencers on your blog, or by guest posting on a larger blog. While these things don’t guarantee trust, they will help people feel a bit more open to trusting you.</p>
<p>For more help with social proof, check out <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/strategies-to-help-convert-first-time-visitors-into-interested-readers-of-your-blog/">episode 114 of the podcast</a></span> where I cover four types of social proof you can use on your blog.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">However, social proof will only take you so far.</span> It can speed things up a bit with helping new readers open up to you. But you still need to earn their trust.</p>
<h2>Tip #2: Trust Grows Faster When It’s Reciprocated</h2>
<p>While I think it’s true that people do business with those they know, like, and trust, I think it also works the other way around.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">People are more likely to do business with you when they feel you know, like, and trust </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">them</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Knowing</span> your readers is pretty easy. You can find out their demographics and the kind of language they use.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Liking</span> them has to be authentic. Do you genuinely like your readers?</p>
<p>I really love my readers on ProBlogger. One of the reasons I started the ProBlogger event was because I wanted to meet my readers. They’re fantastic people. We have a lot of fun, and we enjoy each other’s company.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Trusting</span> your readers might mean being vulnerable – sharing how you feel about the problem they’re having, and how you want to help them overcome it too.</p>
<h2>Two Ways to Create Content that Builds Trust</h2>
<p>When you create content, choosing the right tone and using personal language can help build trust. Aim to:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create content that’s vulnerable.</span> Talk about the areas you’re still learning about, the areas where you’re still making mistakes, and the questions you don’t know the answers to. This shows your readers that you trust them.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create content that has some personal touches, or tells a story.</span> This doesn’t have to be deeply personal, but showing a little of who you are can really build a connection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, if you want to gain your readers&#8217; trust you need to be trustworthy. Be transparent with your readers, act with integrity, treat them with respect, and keep your promises.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Once you have your readers’ trust, treasure it. </span>As the saying goes, trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair.</p>
<p>Do you think your readers trust you? Do you trust <span style="font-style: italic;">them? </span>Leave a comment below to share your thoughts and any tips you have for building greater trust.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-write-effective-sales-copy/">episode 146</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast. </span></p>
<p>Before you start writing your sales page, promotional blog post, tweets or Facebook updates to sell something, you need to do something else.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You need to listen.</span></p>
<p>I first came across this advice many years ago, and since then I’ve heard from numerous people. Robert Bruce breaks it down very well in his Copyblogger post <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.copyblogger.com/great-copywriter/">How to Become a Truly Great Copywriter</a></span>, where he writes about three core ways you need to listen.</p>
<p>It’s a short post, with three key paragraphs I want to dig into here.</p>
<h2>#1: Listen to the Product’s Creator</h2>
<p>Robert writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen to the creator of the product you’re selling. Let her talk (for hours if necessary) about what makes it work, why she built it, what she hopes it will do for her customers. This practice alone can give you the bulk of your copy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe someone on your team created a product or service your business sells. Maybe you’re selling an ebook that someone else wrote. (All our Digital Photography School ebooks and courses have been created in partnership with someone else.)</p>
<p>Even if you created the product yourself, you might find it helpful to run through some of these questions:</p>
<p>Why do you want to create this product? Who’s it for? (Or if it has already created, who did you have in mind when you created it?)</p>
<p>What are the benefits of the product? How do you use it? What makes it work? What’s the product’s ‘secret sauce’? What problem does it solve?</p>
<p>Do you have any or worries about how your product will be perceived? What are they? (This is really useful information, as it lets you know the limitations of the product, or how it could potentially be misunderstood.)</p>
<p>Are there any similar products out there? How is your product different?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Over at Digital Photography School we ask a lot of these questions before the product is created.</span> The author or creator gives us a description or outline of the product and tells us who it’s for. This helps us decide whether the product will be a good fit for our audience, and how to market it.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example. When we launched Mike Newton’s Adobe Lightroom course, we noticed that Mike kept using the words “mastering Lightroom” when explaining the course to us. He wanted to help people master Lightroom.</p>
<p>We liked that, and decided to call the course <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://resources.digital-photography-school.com/download/lightroom-mastery-course/">Lightroom Mastery</a></span>. We used the word “mastering” quite a bit in the sales copy.</p>
<p>That’s just one example of how an author’s language helped shape the sales material.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This can also work if you’re doing an affiliate promotion.</span> Ideally you’d talk to the product creator. But if you can’t then look at the sales copy they use, the blog posts they’ve written about their product, and interviews they’ve done with other bloggers.</p>
<h2>#2: Listen to Your Audience</h2>
<p>Robert writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen to your audience. What are they telling you — directly or indirectly — about what they really want and need? If social media has given us anything, it’s an unprecedented ability to hear the demands and desires of real people, in real time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love this idea of listening to your audience when it comes to sales copy. This is something you want to do before you even start creating products. <span style="font-weight: bold;">That way, you know your readers’ needs and challenges, and get an insight into the language they use.</span></p>
<p>When you’re writing sales copy, ask yourself some of these questions:</p>
<p>Who is the audience? Who will buy this product?</p>
<p>What are their pain points? What are their challenges? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/solve-a-readers-problem-day-16-of-31-days-to-build-a-better-blog/">What are their problems</a></span>? How do they express these – what language do they use?</p>
<p>What do they hope to gain? What are the dreams they hope could come true by using your product, or a product like yours? Again, what language do they use to describe these?</p>
<p>What are their fears? What questions do they have about your product, and what objections do they raise? (These may come out <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> you’ve launched your product. If they do you can edit your sales page, perhaps by adding Frequently Asked Questions section.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can also ask your readers about their challenges directly.</span> When we were launching the Lightroom cause, I asked on the Digital Photograph School Facebook page, “What are your frustrations and challenges with Lightroom?”</p>
<p>Two themes came out strongly:</p>
<ul>
<li>people had bought the software, but felt overwhelmed by it and weren’t using it</li>
<li>people had so many photos they didn’t have time to process them.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so we weaved these two themes into our sales copy.</p>
<h2>#3: Listen to Your Competitors</h2>
<p>Robert writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen to your competitors. It’s wise to have a view of the entire field. What’s working in your market? What’s not working? What can you learn from others’ success and failure (and from the language that got them there)?</p></blockquote>
<p>In the blogging space you can learn a lot from your competitors, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/3-reasons-why-i-dont-worry-about-the-competition/">who may also be your collaborators. </a></span></p>
<p>On Digital Photography School we often create products with people who are actually our competitors. The Lightroom course I’ve been referring to was created by Mike Newton, who sells similar products to ours on his own site. He came onto our radar when we were looking for affiliate products to promote, and we learned a lot by looking at how he was selling his products.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Knowing what other people are selling and how they’re selling it can really shape what you do</span>. Maybe the way they do their sales pages, their launch emails, or even their social media will inspire you.</p>
<p>If you’re selling something at the moment, or if you’re about to create your first product, do this listening exercise.</p>
<p>Listen to whoever created the product, whether it was you or someone else.</p>
<p>Listen to your audience and understand the language they use – this should be the basis for your sales copy.</p>
<p>Listen to your competitors and collaborators, too.</p>
<p>That way you’ll be creating a product your readers will love, and promoting it in a way that shows how it can help them.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-your-obsession-with-creating-new-content-could-be-hurting-your-blog/">episode 145</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast.</span></p>
<p>Is your obsession with new content hurting your blog?</p>
<p>As bloggers, we tend to focus on what we’re creating <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span> rather than what we created months or even years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s important to put time and effort into creating new content for our blogs. And that’s what we do here with both ProBlogger and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://digital-photography-school.com/">Digital Photography School</a></span>. We want to make those posts useful and practical, and to ensure they’re well edited, attractive to the reader, and optimized for search engines.</p>
<p>It’s good that we do all that. And it’s also good that we promote our new content. We share it on social networks, put it in our newsletter, and encourage engagement through comments on the blog and on social media.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: <span style="font-weight: bold;">The week your post goes live is only the </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">beginning </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">of its life online.</span></p>
<p>Sure, it will get a spike in traffic for a few days after it’s published. But what happens in the months, years, and potentially decades after you hit ‘publish’ can completely dwarf those first few days.</p>
<p>That’s why evergreen content is so important. I won’t get into creating it too much in this post, but if you want to know more there are plenty of resources on ProBlogger including:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Why Your Archives are an Amazing Asset</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you’ve been blogging for a year or more, your archives probably contain loads of great content that can really help your readers. </span></p>
<p>It may take a while for your regular readers – particularly the newest ones – to get to those archive posts. But readers who come in from search engines are more than likely to land on one. In fact, when I looked at the Google Analytics for Digital Photography School, the 14 most recent posts got only 15% of the overall traffic. The remaining 85% went to older posts.</p>
<p>So don’t assume your archived posts don’t matter or aren’t useful. They’re almost certainly getting a large share of your traffic.</p>
<p>And don’t assume the people who subscribe to your newsletter or keep coming back to your blog each week have read them either.</p>
<p>Here’s how to focus more on your archives, which can provide a number of benefits.</p>
<h2>Revisiting Archived Posts</h2>
<p>Each day on Digital Photography School I look back at what we published six months ago (which will almost always be two separate posts), and ask myself:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#1: Is the content evergreen?</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>If it is, I schedule both posts to be published on Facebook the following day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#2: Is the post still relevant?</span> If it’s related to a promotion or competition that finished nearly six months ago, or linked to some news that’s no longer relevant, I consider deleting the post.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#3: Are there any mistakes in the post?</span> I look for errors in the post – factual errors, spelling mistakes, broken image, embedded tweets that no longer work, and anything else.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#4: Could I (or my team) improve the post? </span>Maybe it can be enhanced by updating the image or adding <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/make-your-posts-more-readable/">some additional formatting</a></span> to the text. It may even seem a bit dated. (This doesn’t happen too much with six-month-old posts, but occasionally I need to make tweaks to keep them up to date.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#5: Could we link the post to newer content, or link to it from newer content? </span>This helps readers find their way deeper into the site. (It also helps a bit with search engine optimization.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#6: Does the post need additional optimizing for SEO? </span>This means looking at how it’s ranking on Google and potentially tweaking the titles and keywords, or even the alt tags used for the images in the post.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#7: Could we publish a follow-up post tackling the same topic?</span> If the original post got a lot of discussion going, the questions in those comments sometimes give me an idea for a fresh post. Or maybe I’ll ask one of our writers to write a post that takes a different angle.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#8: Is it worth repurposing the post into a new medium? </span>If the post<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>has done really well, I consider whether it’s worth turning the content into a podcast or video.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#9: Does the post need a new </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/write-a-post-that-contains-a-call-to-action-day-23-of-31-days-to-build-a-better-blog/">call to action</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">?</span> Sometimes the call to action we used six months ago is no longer relevant, and we may want to promote a new Facebook group we’ve started or new product we’ve released instead.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#10: Do any comments need to be dealt with?</span> This where I delete any spam that has managed to slip through the moderation system. It also gives me the opportunity to reply to comments I haven’t responded to yet.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">#11: How is the post performing in Google Analytics?</span> If the post has a lot of comments, or gets new comments regularly, I might look in Google Analytics to see how it’s performing. If it’s doing well, it’s a sign I need to pay attention to that post. For instance, I might be able to get it ranking even better.</p>
<p>As I go through these questions, I usually find the posts only need a few small tweaks. But even if I don’t update it, looking at that post helps me put it to the front of my mind.</p>
<h2>Repeating the Process So You Cover All Your Posts Annually</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Once I’ve done this for the posts from six months ago, I do it again with the posts from 12 months ago.</span></p>
<p>I get into a rhythm when I do it, so it only takes me a couple of minutes to look over each post.</p>
<p>I then go back 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, and so on – right back to the start of the blog in 2006.</p>
<p>All up it takes me about an hour. And it’s one of the most valuable things I do each day.</p>
<p>I look at every post in our archive (of more than 6,000) at least twice a year. And many of them get little tweaks along the way.</p>
<p>You might want to try a different system, such as looking only at the posts published one and two years ago. Or you have some other way of looking at posts in your archives – some of which you may have forgotten were even there.</p>
<h2>Why This Process is So Effective</h2>
<p>When I share older posts on social media other people often share them too, which helps to bring in even more traffic.</p>
<p>And updating old posts can help search engines view them more positively – potentially bringing in a lot more traffic over time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I also get loads of new ideas when I do this.</span> For instance, if I see that posts on a particular topic are doing really well, I might think about creating additional content. A while ago we realized a lot of our Digital Photography School posts on Adobe Lightroom were doing especially well, which gave us the idea to create a course on Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>This process also keeps my archives from looking dated and out of touch. I don’t want 85% of people coming to my blog thinking “Meh, this is no good. It’s out of date”.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You may not have an hour a day to devote to this. </span>That’s fine. Make a start anyway. Even spending ten minutes on one post in your archives each day can make a huge difference over time.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear how you maintain your archives and keep older posts up to date (and visible to your current audience). Feel free to share your tips in the comments.</p>

<p>You probably already know you should use “I” and “you” in your blog posts. But how do you use “he”, “she” and “they” in your blogging?</p>
<p>It’s an important issue, and one bloggers don’t always think about.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re working on a blog post and you’ve got a sentences like this:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that [</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">PRONOUN</span><span style="font-style: italic;">] can provide you with relevant samples of [</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">POSSESSIVE PRONOUN</span><span style="font-style: italic;">] writing.</span></p>
<p>What should go in the ‘pronoun’ spaces? There are several potential options, some of which are more appropriate than others.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Option #1: If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">he</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">his</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Option #2: If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">she</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">her</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Option #3: If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">he/she</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">his/her</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Option #4: If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">they</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">their</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Option #5: If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">it</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">its</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p>We can dismiss option #5 immediately. In most contexts, “it” sounds bizarre and dehumanising when referring to a person. (There are a few exceptions, such as “It’s a girl!” when a baby is born.)</p>
<p>So which of the other four options should you pick. And why does it matter?</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Option #1: Use “He” Because It&#8217;s How It Was Traditionally Done</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">he</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">his</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p>A few generations ago, a sentence like this wouldn’t have raised an eyebrow. (Well, other than because “blogging” wasn’t a thing back then.)</p>
<p>Traditionally, “he” could be used in this type of sentence as a neutral pronoun to encompass both male and female. Old style guides might still suggest it be used that way.</p>
<p>But today it’s rare to come across any writer who believes “he” can be used neutrally. Regardless of the intent, “he” inevitably implies the person being referred to is male, not female.</p>
<p>In our example sentence, using “he” might be seen as implying that freelance bloggers are mostly male (or even that they <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> be male), which is far from ideal.</p>
<p>One case where it might make sense to use “he” for hypothetical people is when you’re writing for a blog aimed solely at males (e.g. a blog about prostate cancer). But it can still be an issue, as we’ll come to when we discuss the use of “they”.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Option #2: Use “She” to Make a Point</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">she</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">her</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p>An alternative approach is to use “she”. It’s likely to stand out because it’s not as common as using “he”, which may be what you want. For instance, you might want to challenge the reader’s unconscious assumptions by using “she” to talk about hypothetical CEOs or managers.</p>
<p>The danger with this approach is that, just like using “he”, it can come across as exclusive and ruling men out of the conversation. It could also imply that you feel some roles are or should be female only (e.g. using “she” when talking about an assistant or secretary).</p>
<p>Again, “she” might make sense is if you have a blog aimed solely at females (e.g. a blog about ovarian cancer). But it can also be an issue, as we’ll come to when we discuss the use of “they”.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Option #3: Use “He/She” to Keep Things Equal</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">he/she</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">his/her</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is people won’t object to it on grammatical grounds. But if you do it for more than a sentence or two it becomes very clunky to read, which is a real disadvantage.</p>
<p>You could use “s/he” instead of “he/she”, but that also starts to look clumsy after a while. And there’s no real variation for “his/her”.</p>
<p>Still, if you’re writing something very formal or official then using “he/she” might be your best option.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to alternate between “he” and “she” in successive blog posts, or perhaps in successive examples within a single blog post. So you might write something like this:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">he</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">his</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">[&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Make sure you offer your freelance blogger feedback on how </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">she</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> is doing. It’s unfair to blame </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">her</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> for not meeting expectations you haven’t clearly set out.</span></p>
<p>If you’re determined to avoid using “they” (which we’ll come to in a moment), then alternating between “he” and “she” is probably the best method. But you need to make sure you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> alternating (rather than simply throwing in a “she” occasionally), and that you’re not using “he” for higher status roles than “she”.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Option #4: Use “They”, Either as a Singular Pronoun or By Rewriting the Sentence</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to hire a blogger to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">they</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">their</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p>This is my favourite option. These days I simply use it as a singular pronoun. I know some people dislike that, but it’s become very common across all sorts of media. (It’s also found in writing going back centuries, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/06/06/he-or-she-versus-they/">as the Oxford Dictionaries site explains here</a></span>.)</p>
<p>There are several crucial advantages to using “they” in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s truly neutral</li>
<li>It doesn’t look clunky like “he/she” or “s/he”</li>
<li>It’s inclusive of non-binary readers</li>
</ul>
<p>That third point is important, and may need some unpacking.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some of your readers may not identify as being either male or female.</span> This can be the case even if your blog is aimed at a particular biological sex. (If you’re writing about ovarian cancer or prostate cancer, some of your readers may well be non-binary. You might also have transgender readers.)</p>
<p>The preferred pronoun for most of these readers is likely to be “they” (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34901704">though there are other options such as “ze”</a></span>), so using it as your all-purpose neutral pronoun makes great sense. That way you’re including all your readers: male, female and non-binary.</p>
<p>But if you’re strongly opposed to using “they” as a singular pronoun, there’s a simple solution: rewrite your sentence to make the subject plural.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">If you want to hire </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">bloggers</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> to write for you, it’s important that </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">they</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> can provide you with relevant samples of </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">their</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">writing.</span></p>
<p>While it won’t work for every sentence of this type, in most cases it will solve the he/she/they issue. No-one will fault you on your grammar, and it’s inclusive of readers of any gender.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why This Matters (Even Though It’s Your Blog)</span></h2>
<p>A few weeks ago the he/she/they issue generated a huge discussion in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.facebook.com/groups/probloggercom/">ProBlogger Community group on Facebook</a></span>.</p>
<p>One of the views there was along the lines of:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">It’s my blog. I’ll do what I like, and if readers don’t like it then I don’t want them as readers anyway.</span></p>
<p>Another view was along these lines:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">People get offended too easily these days.</span></p>
<p>While I can understand those perspectives, I disagree with them.</p>
<p>Of course we should be free to run our blogs however we like, and that includes the language we use. For instance, bloggers who swear frequently might feel it’s a crucial part of their brand. And they’re happy to pay the price of losing some readers who don’t like that kind of language.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But I don’t think we should see he/she/they as a minor, insignificant issue that people are just waiting to be ‘offended’ over. </span></p>
<p>Instead, it’s an opportunity to bring about a more equal world where people of all genders feel equally valued and welcomed, which is hopefully something we all want. As bloggers and writers, we have an important role to play here.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end it’s your blog and your choice about the pronouns you use. All I ask is that you give it a bit of thought, and consider that your assumptions (e.g. “Everyone knows ‘he’ can be used as a neutral pronoun”, “Everyone is either a ‘he’ or a ‘she’”) might not be correct.</p>
<p>It’s also worth keeping in mind that language changes and evolves over time. And that’s a good thing. It means the words we use reflect the changing society in which we live. Just because a particular grammatical rule or guideline was in use fifty years ago doesn’t mean it should still be used today.</p>
<p>How do you handle the “he/she/they” issue on your blog? Is it something you’ve already considered? Is there something you might change going forward? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>Do you ever feel stuck in your blogging or your business?</p>
<p>I think many of us can relate to feeling paralysed at times – not just with blogging or business, but in other areas of life as well.</p>
<p>You might feel stuck and unable to move forward because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re a perfectionist, and can’t move on from one thing until you’re convinced it’s just right.</li>
<li>You’re caught up in &#8216;analysis paralysis&#8217;. You keep looking at the different options, but you can’t pick one and move forward.</li>
<li>You don’t have a clear idea of where you’re going. And you can’t make progress without knowing your destination.</li>
<li>You always feel you need to know or have something more (develop a particular skill or more confidence, meet more people, have more money, etc.) before taking a particular action.</li>
<li>You compare yourself with other people. It feels like everything you want to do has already been done, or that everyone else is doing it better.</li>
<li>You feel overwhelmed by all the advice out there, and don’t know what to do first.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I can certainly relate to a lot of things on that list.</span> I can get stuck when I have so many ideas that I can&#8217;t decide what to do first. Fear is also a big one for me. I worry what other people will think of me, how I&#8217;ll sound, how I&#8217;ll come across, what might happen if I make a mistake, and so on.</p>
<p>Perfectionism is a struggle for me. I imagine <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">what I want to accomplish, and create the perfect picture of it in my mind</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">. But then taking action seems risky, because whatever I do will never </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">measure up to the way I imagined it. And so I&#8217;m </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">tempted to do nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But whatever the reason, being stuck will hold you back in any kind of business</span> – especially in the online world where you need to keep active and keep moving.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Take Imperfect Action</h2>
<p>&#8216;Imperfect action&#8217; is always better than &#8216;perfect inaction&#8217;.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In fact, imperfect action is really the only kind there is. </span>No-one ever takes perfect action.</p>
<p>Imperfect action gets things done. It’s what separates the dreamers from those who accomplish great things.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key benefits.</p>
<h3>#1: Imperfect Action Creates Momentum</h3>
<p>When you take one small, imperfect action, the next steps often reveal themselves.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, some people don’t take action because they can’t see the big picture. But you may never <em>see</em> that big picture until you start taking steps forward.</p>
<p>I sometimes find that taking that first step towards a fuzzy goal makes it clearer for me. And starting to move gives me the energy to carry on.</p>
<h3>#2: Imperfect Action Builds Confidence and Courage</h3>
<p>I love this quote from Dale Carnegie:</p>
<blockquote><p>Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taking one small action can help give you the confidence to take the next, slightly bigger action. </span>Keep moving a little bit further outside your comfort zone, and your comfort zone will expand.</p>
<h3>#3: Imperfect Action Teaches You to Learn by Doing</h3>
<p>Do you feel you don’t have the skills to tackle what lies ahead? Take imperfect action, and you’ll learn a lot – fast.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The day I started my first blog was probably the day I </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">learned </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">the most about blogging – ever.</span> I learned so many new skills, and understood so much more than the day before.</p>
<h3>#4: Imperfect Action Leads to Self-Discovery and Self-Improvement</h3>
<p>As well as learning new skills, you’ll learn so much about yourself by taking action. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stepping out of your comfort zone will help you think about who you are and how you react in these situations. </span></p>
<p>For me, starting my blog helped me develop my ideas, and discover passions I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise known I had.</p>
<h3>#5: Imperfect Action is Relatable</h3>
<p>This is something I think a lot of bloggers, podcasters and online entrepreneurs should understand. We’re often tempted to make our posts, products and sales materials perfect. But if we make things <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span> perfect they’re not as relatable because they&#8217;ve lost some of their &#8216;humanness&#8217;.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t aim for excellence. (For instance, your posts should always be edited well.) But don&#8217;t feel you need to eliminate every imperfection. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Humanness, vulnerability and imperfection help others relate to us and feel a connection.</span></p>
<p>Today, I encourage you take your next best step. You don’t necessarily need to reach your destination. You just need to take the next best step that will move you towards it.</p>
<h2>What if You’re Really Stuck?</h2>
<p>But what if you don&#8217;t think taking your next step will be enough to help you regain your momentum? That happened to me at one point with ProBlogger, when I realised I’d been putting off several different tasks. They were on my &#8216;someday&#8217; list, but never quite made it to my &#8216;today&#8217; list.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To get moving again, I set aside an entire week to get things done.</span> I came up with a list of ten things I needed to do – things I’d been avoiding – that I could achieve in a week. Each one took half a day or less.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I also turned off a lot of the input in my life. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">No blog posts, no podcasts, no social media, no Netflix, and very limited email. I stopped consuming for a week, and started creating instead.</span></p>
<p>It turned out to be a really great week.</p>
<p>Putting that week aside and creating those boundaries meant I not only got a lot done, but also got my momentum back. And the following week was really productive too because I was in &#8216;creating&#8217; mode.</p>
<p>Could you take one &#8216;next best step&#8217; towards your goals today? Could you look ahead in your calendar and block out a week to really focus on moving forward and building your momentum? Let us know what you’ll be doing in the comments.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">This post is based on </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://problogger.com/podcast/how-to-overcome-failure-in-6-steps/">episode 190</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of the ProBlogger podcast.</span></p>
<p>Most of us don’t want to learn about failure because we don’t want to fail.</p>
<p>But we all do.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">And that’s okay, because failure is an essential part of any business. </span>If you’ve never failed then you’ve probably stayed in your comfort zone. And the fact you’re holding back means you’ll never know just how successful you can be.</p>
<p>So learning how to overcome failure is critical. And in today’s post I’ll take you through six things I try to do when I’m facing failure or I’ve made a mistake – no matter how big or small it was.</p>
<p>A lot of these tips will apply to areas of your life outside of blogging. Unfortunately, blogging mistakes can sometimes become very public failures. The things we do may not work out, and there can be consequences.</p>
<h2>Your Emotional Response to Failure</h2>
<p>So what’s the first thing I do when I fail?</p>
<p>I freak out.</p>
<p>Yep, just like everyone else I panic and get upset, which is a perfectly natural way to react. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It’s important to get those feelings out, rather than denying them or bottling them up.</span></p>
<p>Just make sure you’re not doing anything that could have long-lasting consequences – for you, those around you, or your business – while you’re getting those feelings out. (You may want to step away from your computer and avoid saying anything online while you’re going through this.)</p>
<h2>Six Steps to Overcoming Failure</h2>
<p>Once you’re past that initial emotional response, here are six steps you can follow to help overcome it.</p>
<h3>Step #1: Separate Your Failure from Your Identity</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equating your self-worth with your achievements (or lack thereof) and what other people think of you is a huge trap.</span></p>
<p>The message we hear all the time – in conversations, the media and marketing messages – is that our self-worth equals what we achieve plus what others think of us.</p>
<p>So to be worthwhile we think we need to achieve a lot <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> have other people think well of us. We might not <span style="font-style: italic;">consciously</span> think about this, but we constantly look for success and want to look good in front of other people.</p>
<p>But that’s not realistic.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">All of us will fail in our personal and business life at some point or other.</span> And there will always be times when other people don’t think much of us. If we base our self-worth on our success and other people’s perceptions, there will be times when we don’t have much at all.</p>
<p>Instead, look for something deeper to root your self-worth in. For me, it’s my faith. For you, it might be something different.</p>
<p>Just because something you tried in your business failed doesn’t make <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> a failure.</p>
<h3>Step #2: Don’t Face it Alone</h3>
<p>I often see friends fall into the trap of internalising their failure and facing it alone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One of the best things you can do is to admit your failure and share it with at least one other person. </span>It could be your partner, or perhaps a close friend. Even if they don’t understand your business, you can still talk to them about it.</p>
<p>Internalising your failure and not talking to anyone about it can make it seem far bigger than it really is, to the point where it can completely overwhelm you.</p>
<p>When you talk to someone about your failure, or even a concern you have about your business, it helps you put it into perspective. It can also help you to find solutions and ways forward.</p>
<p>Next, look for a second person to talk to – someone who <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> understand your business. That might be a fellow blogger, or perhaps a business coach or mentor.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could look for a support group (such as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/problogger/~https://www.facebook.com/groups/probloggercom/">ProBlogger Community</a></span> Facebook group) to share your failure or mistake and look for advice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Finally, there might be times when you need a therapist or counselor.</span> If your failure has really shaken your confidence or affected your mental health in some way, there’s no shame in asking for help from a professional.</p>
<h3>Step #3: Be Transparent</h3>
<p>When you talk to a friend, colleague or therapist about your failure, be transparent about it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As you start processing your failure, you may realise it affects other people</span>: a business partner or team member, or maybe even your readers.</p>
<p>When other people can be hurt by our mistakes, it’s tempting to hide our failures and pretend they didn’t happen, or even lie about them. But in most cases this just makes things worse.</p>
<p>It’s better to come clean.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Admit the failure to those affected by it, and own your part in it.</span> Deal with the consequences, and try to right any wrongs that have been done.</p>
<p>Owning your mistakes and failures, and taking responsibility for them, is often well received by other people. Most people are generous and gracious, and may even be able to help you find a solution.</p>
<h3>Step #4: Learn From It</h3>
<p>I say to my kids all the time that making mistakes isn’t a bad thing. It’s making the same mistake repeatedly and not learning from it that’s an issue.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What can you learn from your failure? Why did it happen? What could you do differently next time to get a different result?</span></p>
<p>Don’t run away from your failure. Instead, embrace it. See it as a learning opportunity, and a chance to do things differently next time.</p>
<p>If you think back to previous failures you’ve had, you may realise that some of them made you who you are today. It’s easy to see in hindsight, but try to see it in the moment as well. Ask yourself, “What can I learn from this? How can I turn it around?”</p>
<h3>Step #5: Keep Moving</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There are definitely times in business when we need to stop and take a break.</span> After a failure, you may need to rest for a while so you can focus on looking after yourself. But then you need to move on and keep the momentum of your business going.</p>
<p>When I taught my youngest son to ride a bike, he had his fair share of crashes. He got scrapes and bruises on his elbows and knees. Understandably, there were moments after each crash when he said, “I don’t want to do it. I don’t want to ride a bike.”</p>
<p>That’s a natural reaction. But to learn how to ride a bike he needed to get back on and try again.</p>
<p>The same applies to your mistakes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Once you’re past the initial emotional reaction, and you’ve given yourself a bit of time to rest if necessary, you need to get back on that bike.</span></p>
<p>Identify your next best step. It might be to pick up the pieces and start again, or to evolve what you do. It may even be time for you to start something new.</p>
<h3>Step #6: Look for the Positive Side</h3>
<p>I know it annoys the people around me sometimes, but I always look for the positive side of things.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Even in the midst of incredible failure, there’s almost always a glimmer of something positive. </span></p>
<p>It may take a while for those glimmers to emerge. But when you see them, focus on them. The little sparks from a failure could well turn into your next big thing.</p>
<p>I can think of a lot of people who have experienced failure only to discover a new passion, including helping other people going through what they’ve been through.</p>
<p>Has something gone badly for you in your blogging or business life recently?</p>
<p>As you face failure, try to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Separate the failure from your identity and self-worth</li>
<li>Turn to family, friends, fellow bloggers and professionals to help you get through it</li>
<li>Be transparent and honest about the failure and its effect on those around you</li>
<li>Learn from what happened so you can avoid making the same mistake again</li>
<li>Keep moving and keep up your momentum: get back on that bike</li>
<li>Look for any sparks of opportunity or anything good that can come out of your failure</li>
</ol>
