&lt;p&gt;Sales and Marketing alignment is a wonderful and yet elusive thing. Many B2B marketers and sales professionals in particular are in search of leadership, strategy, best practices and networks of peers they can connect with as they adapt to an ever changing marketing world. Lucky for those working in B2B industries, there's an upcoming conference in Boston that was developed for just this purpose: &lt;a href="https://b2bsalesmarketing.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;B2B Sales and Marketing Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That name might sound familiar because the same people at Demand Gen Report who brought you B2BMX in Scottsdale have expanded. This first B2BSMX event in Boston features both a Sales and Marketing focus with 6 keynotes, 50+ sessions and over 1,000 registrants. &lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com"&gt;TopRank Marketing&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with &lt;a href="https://b2bsalesmarketing.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;B2BSMX&lt;/a&gt; to give you a glimpse at some of the top talent speaking at the conference through a series of pre-conference interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get started with the impressive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexandra_gobbi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alexandra Gobbi&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Marketing Officer at Secureworks. At B2BSMX Alex will be presenting, &lt;em&gt;The Five Languages Of Digital Transformation&lt;/em&gt;, on Tuesday, August 13th at 2:39 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for joining us for B2B Marketing Spotlight. Today, we are fortunate to have with us Alex Gobbi, CMO of Secureworks, which is a global cyber security company. Welcome, Alex!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for having me, Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden&lt;/strong&gt;: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself and your role at Secureworks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-26804 alignright" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Alexandra-Gobbi-LI.jpg" alt="Alexandra Gobbi" width="250" height="338" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; I've been in B2B tech marketing for over 20 years. I've been with &lt;a href="https://www.secureworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Secureworks&lt;/a&gt; coming up on three years. My role is global CMO. I have end-to-end marketing responsibilities for the brand, the messaging, everything that's around corporate communications, product marketing, analysts relations, demand generation, field marketing, event marketing and marketing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow. Yes, that really is end-to-end isn't it? You've been in the digital marketing world for 20 years or so and you've held previous senior marketing leadership positions at companies like EarthLink and HP, plus I think you had some independent consulting experience. I'm curious, out of those experiences what has best prepared you for the role of CMO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi&lt;/strong&gt;: I think every single role prepares you along the way. I spent about nine years with a management consulting company called A.T. Kearney and I will say that experience prepared me exceptionally well for the core skills of problem solving, presentation skills, and analytical skills that I've really used throughout my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consultant I had the good fortune of working across different industries and then working with different levels of leadership, so that's also been a great experience. I would say every single experience has really helped me in terms of what it takes to build a great team, how you manage and motivate teams, how important analyst and influencer relations are, and building out demand generation. I dipped my toe in Demand Generation at EarthLink and really got into running a Demand Gen engine at Secureworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The CMO is not only responsible for leading the marketing team, but you also are an executive with a seat at the table. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I would say my product marketing experience is mainly from my experience at EarthLink. But as you well know, the CMO is not only responsible for leading the marketing team, but you also are an executive with a seat at the table. I think these past few years have really enhanced my appreciation for that perspective of the CMO role, which is really having a point of view at the table and interacting really, really closely with other members of the executive team. Just continuing to have that voice of the customer and voice of the market perspective has been valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; The CMO role really brings marketing to that executive level. I forget the statistic, but there's an increasing number of &lt;a href="https://www.raconteur.net/hr/marketers-the-future-ceos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CEOs coming from marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi&lt;/strong&gt; I haven't seen that. That's great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; There's a certain well-roundedness to a CMO as a CEO. Of course I may be biased being a marketer myself, but as someone who gets to work with a variety of different large B2B company executives, sometimes you see what their CEOs are like. Those that have come from marketing are wonderful to work with. Not that others aren't, but if you compare a CEO that's come from finance or some other operational discipline versus marketing, it is a different interaction, a different leadership style sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We are all operating in a digital economy and I think that is something marketers really understand. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; I agree with you. I think that's a great statistic to hear. I hear that boards are trying to get more CMOs at the table as well and I think it's long overdue, really. Marketing in and of itself is a fantastic training ground. We are all operating in a digital economy and I think that is something marketers really understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; With your global end-to-end responsibilities, I'm kind of curious, has your ability to speak five different languages ever been put to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. In fact, I look for those opportunities. Except for a few years at EarthLink, I've always worked in global environments. It's been a great asset to be able to speak those languages just because of the trust that kind of gets built from the get-go, if you will, when you're native and you know the tongue of your French or your German or your Italian counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The ability (for marketers) to engage with your counterparts, whether it's in HR or product marketing or in finance, in their language is really key to be able to establish trust. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's certainly helped me a lot and I think it's given me an appreciation for language, which is kind of going to be the topic of my presentation at B2BSMX. Of course there are the languages of the world, but there are also business languages. Not understanding that we don't all speak the same language can be a huge barrier to trust and to being able to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You spoke earlier about CEOs that come from a finance background versus from a marketing background, and if you've grown up in a certain function, there is a language, a business language, that's innate to that function that you're unconsciously biased towards. And so the ability to engage with your counterparts, whether it's in HR or product marketing or in finance, in their language is really key to be able to establish trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; That's a really good point. I'm kind of curious, what is the genesis of your presentation at B2BSMX? Is it a function of what you've experienced and your ability to advance and be successful or patterns of success and best practices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. I mean, I think you hit on it with the fact that I grew up with five languages, so I probably have just an innate sensitivity to being able to communicate and articulate using the same vocabulary and the same words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, like you've mentioned, I've had both successes, and probably failures as well, where you realize that you're just not getting your point across or your interpreter, the person that you're speaking to, has just checked out or he's just not engaged because they really don't understand what you're talking about. So the idea has come from both my personal background and a topic that's just something that's authentic to me, as well as the experiences I've had over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; It's interesting, when you look at something like digital transformation and how broad of an impact that can have on a company, it really is important to have empathy for those different constituents that are going to have to be part of that change, right? It's not just about the technology is it? It's about culture and other elements too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; It is and I think at the heart of digital transformation is this notion of the ability to be agile and to be quick. Underpinning that is really how fast can you communicate and how easily those communications flow up and down the organization. Language is a part of that, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. I'm curious, speaking of digital transformation, what are some ways that you see digital transformation happening in organizations in terms of how marketing is done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marketing, has gone digital over the past 10 years at a speed that is unparalleled to any other function. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I think marketing, has gone digital over the past 10 years at a speed that is unparalleled to any other function. And not only have we gone digital in the ability for technology to make us smarter about our customers and our target audience but to be able to know more about them, target them better and to engage more effectively.  We've been able to do so in a way that's probably unsurpassed relative to the other functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly HR has gone digital, finance has gone digital in terms of increasing productivity or increasing access to internal data, but marketing really bridges that gap between the internal data of the organization and the digital engagement of your customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; Let's switch gears just a little bit. This is something I've seen a lot of talk about over the last couple of years. How important do you think it is for senior executives to pay attention to their own personal brand, especially in areas like social media or their own thought leadership?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A voice as an individual, be that a leader or a consumer, can sometimes be just as loud as the voice of the marketing department in promoting a brand. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it's important to have an awareness of your own personal brand, and I think because of digital, a voice as an individual, be that a leader or a consumer, can sometimes be just as loud as the voice of the marketing department in promoting a brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think having that awareness is really job one. I think job two is recognizing that you've got a market. You've got to engage authentically with influencers and with customers because their voices can be just as loud on digital. I also think that it shouldn't be a check box. I've seen executives that say, "Well I need to have a Twitter handle and I need to have a LinkedIn handle," and "Hey marketing, can you just manage that for me?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you're going to have a digital voice as an executive, have an authentic digital voice. Have one that is true to who you are and not just replicating the social handle of the company. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is where it's just inauthentic, right? If you're going to have a digital voice as an executive, have an authentic digital voice. Have one that is true to who you are and not just replicating the social handle of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; Excellent. I love that. Great to hear it. We have a pretty substantial audience that is in that mid-level part of their career and I'm kind of curious, what can you share for someone who really aspires to achieving a CMO level of success in their marketing career? What advice might you give them as an up-and-coming marketing leader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The more you can learn about how the P&amp;amp;L of the company works and how, really, the company is not only driving revenues but also driving those profitably, the better. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; It's a great question. I would say a couple of things that I would consider. One is, gain an appreciation for the other business functions that are critical to the success of any company. The more you can learn about how the P&amp;amp;L of the company works and how, really, the company is not only driving revenues but also driving those profitably, the better. So, engage with finance and really understand that. You don't have to become a whiz at it, but just understanding some of those basic things, I think, will get you a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, walk in the shoes and understand your sellers. Understand your product management team. Those are going to be key counterparts with marketing. I think the more you understand the world that they live in, the more you can engage and bring the value of marketing in the context of their world. I would say that would be one piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other pieces of advice would be don't be too fixated on your next career move within marketing. What I have found is if you're open to opportunities, working with the right team, the right leadership, can really expose you to new areas and help you appreciate other areas of marketing that may not be the one that you are most familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a digital marketer and there's an opportunity for you to work in analyst relations, work in the events team, or to work in field marketing, seize those opportunities. Every single one of those facets can bring value and, as a CMO, you need to understand the end-to-end and how all those functions play well together and the thread between all of those functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; What are some of the top resources that you rely on from a marketing perspective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nothing beats a peer network. Building a great network of other marketers is fantastic, and it really needs to be an authentic network. @alexandra_gobbi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, I think nothing beats a peer network. Building a great network of other marketers is fantastic, and it really needs to be an authentic network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found over my career that people I've worked with or people I've had the opportunity to interact with and to get to know are the people that I can just pick up the phone or send a quick text to and say, hey, I'm struggling with this. Do you have any advice, or, who do you know that does this type of work, or what are some of the metrics that you use? For those types of questions, I think my network been great for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also say that I've really gained a huge appreciation for all of the organizations that make marketing successful, whether it's your PR agency, your digital agency, or your demand gen agency. I've had fantastic partners along the way that I've come to rely on, and that have really educated me in a lot of areas that have been key to my success or to our organization's success. So those will be some of the people that I would reach out to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; What are some of your top digital marketing priorities for 2020? What are some high level areas that you feel like you're really going to focus on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; We just implemented ABM technology last year and it's been phenomenal in terms of the impact that it's already had through initial pilots and now the rollout to the organization. I think continuing to hone our account-based marketing skills is going to be a key priority, and really thinking about how we apply our core demand gen engine paired with account based marketing to be successful. What does that look like in terms of ABM 2.0, if you will, in terms of website personalization and all of those things. That would be one of the key priorities that we have for next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say a second priority is continuing to simplify our portfolio. Secureworks has a very broad portfolio of end-to end-products and solutions in the security operations space. I think, from a marketing perspective, the more we can simplify and bundle offerings the easier we make it to position and digest end-to-end value propositions for our sellers as well as full marketing is always going to be another priority for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; That makes sense. My last question for you, Alex, is what are you most excited about for the upcoming B2B SMX conference in Boston?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Gobbi:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, as you know, when you and I first spoke of, you know, this is my first B2B Sales and Marketing Exchange. So for me, it's really very exciting to attend and get to know the perspective of some of my peers as well as some of the other presenters. I love that it is purely B2B focused and I actually love that it is marketing and sales focused. So I think just in general, the whole theme and the concept for the conference is something that I'm excited about, and building new connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Odden:&lt;/strong&gt; Fantastic. Thank you for your time, Alex!&lt;/p&gt;

Sales and Marketing alignment is a wonderful and yet elusive thing. Many B2B marketers and sales professionals in particular are in search of leadership, strategy, best practices and networks of peers they can connect with as they adapt to an ever changing marketing world. Lucky for those working in B2B industries, there's an upcoming conference in Boston that was developed for just this purpose: <a href="https://b2bsalesmarketing.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B Sales and Marketing Exchange</a>.

That name might sound familiar because the same people at Demand Gen Report who brought you B2BMX in Scottsdale have expanded. This first B2BSMX event in Boston features both a Sales and Marketing focus with 6 keynotes, 50+ sessions and over 1,000 registrants. <a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com">TopRank Marketing</a> has partnered with <a href="https://b2bsalesmarketing.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2BSMX</a> to give you a glimpse at some of the top talent speaking at the conference through a series of pre-conference interviews.

Let's get started with the impressive <a href="https://twitter.com/alexandra_gobbi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandra Gobbi</a>, Chief Marketing Officer at Secureworks. At B2BSMX Alex will be presenting, <em>The Five Languages Of Digital Transformation</em>, on Tuesday, August 13th at 2:39 PM.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> Thank you for joining us for B2B Marketing Spotlight. Today, we are fortunate to have with us Alex Gobbi, CMO of Secureworks, which is a global cyber security company. Welcome, Alex!

<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> Thank you for having me, Lee.

<strong>Lee Odden</strong>: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself and your role at Secureworks?

<img class="size-full wp-image-26804 alignright" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Alexandra-Gobbi-LI.jpg" alt="Alexandra Gobbi" width="250" height="338" />

<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> I've been in B2B tech marketing for over 20 years. I've been with <a href="https://www.secureworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secureworks</a> coming up on three years. My role is global CMO. I have end-to-end marketing responsibilities for the brand, the messaging, everything that's around corporate communications, product marketing, analysts relations, demand generation, field marketing, event marketing and marketing operations.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> Wow. Yes, that really is end-to-end isn't it? You've been in the digital marketing world for 20 years or so and you've held previous senior marketing leadership positions at companies like EarthLink and HP, plus I think you had some independent consulting experience. I'm curious, out of those experiences what has best prepared you for the role of CMO?

<strong>Alex Gobbi</strong>: I think every single role prepares you along the way. I spent about nine years with a management consulting company called A.T. Kearney and I will say that experience prepared me exceptionally well for the core skills of problem solving, presentation skills, and analytical skills that I've really used throughout my career.

As a consultant I had the good fortune of working across different industries and then working with different levels of leadership, so that's also been a great experience. I would say every single experience has really helped me in terms of what it takes to build a great team, how you manage and motivate teams, how important analyst and influencer relations are, and building out demand generation. I dipped my toe in Demand Generation at EarthLink and really got into running a Demand Gen engine at Secureworks.
<blockquote>
<h3>The CMO is not only responsible for leading the marketing team, but you also are an executive with a seat at the table. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
Last but not least, I would say my product marketing experience is mainly from my experience at EarthLink. But as you well know, the CMO is not only responsible for leading the marketing team, but you also are an executive with a seat at the table. I think these past few years have really enhanced my appreciation for that perspective of the CMO role, which is really having a point of view at the table and interacting really, really closely with other members of the executive team. Just continuing to have that voice of the customer and voice of the market perspective has been valuable.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> The CMO role really brings marketing to that executive level. I forget the statistic, but there's an increasing number of <a href="https://www.raconteur.net/hr/marketers-the-future-ceos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CEOs coming from marketing</a>.

<strong>Alex Gobbi</strong> I haven't seen that. That's great.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> There's a certain well-roundedness to a CMO as a CEO. Of course I may be biased being a marketer myself, but as someone who gets to work with a variety of different large B2B company executives, sometimes you see what their CEOs are like. Those that have come from marketing are wonderful to work with. Not that others aren't, but if you compare a CEO that's come from finance or some other operational discipline versus marketing, it is a different interaction, a different leadership style sometimes.
<blockquote>
<h3>We are all operating in a digital economy and I think that is something marketers really understand. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> I agree with you. I think that's a great statistic to hear. I hear that boards are trying to get more CMOs at the table as well and I think it's long overdue, really. Marketing in and of itself is a fantastic training ground. We are all operating in a digital economy and I think that is something marketers really understand.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> With your global end-to-end responsibilities, I'm kind of curious, has your ability to speak five different languages ever been put to use?

<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, I look for those opportunities. Except for a few years at EarthLink, I've always worked in global environments. It's been a great asset to be able to speak those languages just because of the trust that kind of gets built from the get-go, if you will, when you're native and you know the tongue of your French or your German or your Italian counterpart.
<blockquote>
<h3>The ability (for marketers) to engage with your counterparts, whether it's in HR or product marketing or in finance, in their language is really key to be able to establish trust. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
So it's certainly helped me a lot and I think it's given me an appreciation for language, which is kind of going to be the topic of my presentation at B2BSMX. Of course there are the languages of the world, but there are also business languages. Not understanding that we don't all speak the same language can be a huge barrier to trust and to being able to work together.

You spoke earlier about CEOs that come from a finance background versus from a marketing background, and if you've grown up in a certain function, there is a language, a business language, that's innate to that function that you're unconsciously biased towards. And so the ability to engage with your counterparts, whether it's in HR or product marketing or in finance, in their language is really key to be able to establish trust.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> That's a really good point. I'm kind of curious, what is the genesis of your presentation at B2BSMX? Is it a function of what you've experienced and your ability to advance and be successful or patterns of success and best practices?

<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> Absolutely. I mean, I think you hit on it with the fact that I grew up with five languages, so I probably have just an innate sensitivity to being able to communicate and articulate using the same vocabulary and the same words.

But, like you've mentioned, I've had both successes, and probably failures as well, where you realize that you're just not getting your point across or your interpreter, the person that you're speaking to, has just checked out or he's just not engaged because they really don't understand what you're talking about. So the idea has come from both my personal background and a topic that's just something that's authentic to me, as well as the experiences I've had over the years.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> It's interesting, when you look at something like digital transformation and how broad of an impact that can have on a company, it really is important to have empathy for those different constituents that are going to have to be part of that change, right? It's not just about the technology is it? It's about culture and other elements too.

<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> It is and I think at the heart of digital transformation is this notion of the ability to be agile and to be quick. Underpinning that is really how fast can you communicate and how easily those communications flow up and down the organization. Language is a part of that, right?

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> Absolutely. I'm curious, speaking of digital transformation, what are some ways that you see digital transformation happening in organizations in terms of how marketing is done?
<blockquote>
<h3>Marketing, has gone digital over the past 10 years at a speed that is unparalleled to any other function. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> Well, I think marketing, has gone digital over the past 10 years at a speed that is unparalleled to any other function. And not only have we gone digital in the ability for technology to make us smarter about our customers and our target audience but to be able to know more about them, target them better and to engage more effectively.  We've been able to do so in a way that's probably unsurpassed relative to the other functions.

Certainly HR has gone digital, finance has gone digital in terms of increasing productivity or increasing access to internal data, but marketing really bridges that gap between the internal data of the organization and the digital engagement of your customer.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> Let's switch gears just a little bit. This is something I've seen a lot of talk about over the last couple of years. How important do you think it is for senior executives to pay attention to their own personal brand, especially in areas like social media or their own thought leadership?
<blockquote>
<h3>A voice as an individual, be that a leader or a consumer, can sometimes be just as loud as the voice of the marketing department in promoting a brand. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> I think it's important to have an awareness of your own personal brand, and I think because of digital, a voice as an individual, be that a leader or a consumer, can sometimes be just as loud as the voice of the marketing department in promoting a brand.

I think having that awareness is really job one. I think job two is recognizing that you've got a market. You've got to engage authentically with influencers and with customers because their voices can be just as loud on digital. I also think that it shouldn't be a check box. I've seen executives that say, "Well I need to have a Twitter handle and I need to have a LinkedIn handle," and "Hey marketing, can you just manage that for me?".
<blockquote>
<h3>If you're going to have a digital voice as an executive, have an authentic digital voice. Have one that is true to who you are and not just replicating the social handle of the company. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
I think that is where it's just inauthentic, right? If you're going to have a digital voice as an executive, have an authentic digital voice. Have one that is true to who you are and not just replicating the social handle of the company.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> Excellent. I love that. Great to hear it. We have a pretty substantial audience that is in that mid-level part of their career and I'm kind of curious, what can you share for someone who really aspires to achieving a CMO level of success in their marketing career? What advice might you give them as an up-and-coming marketing leader?
<blockquote>
<h3>The more you can learn about how the P&amp;L of the company works and how, really, the company is not only driving revenues but also driving those profitably, the better. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> It's a great question. I would say a couple of things that I would consider. One is, gain an appreciation for the other business functions that are critical to the success of any company. The more you can learn about how the P&amp;L of the company works and how, really, the company is not only driving revenues but also driving those profitably, the better. So, engage with finance and really understand that. You don't have to become a whiz at it, but just understanding some of those basic things, I think, will get you a long way.

Similarly, walk in the shoes and understand your sellers. Understand your product management team. Those are going to be key counterparts with marketing. I think the more you understand the world that they live in, the more you can engage and bring the value of marketing in the context of their world. I would say that would be one piece of advice.

The other pieces of advice would be don't be too fixated on your next career move within marketing. What I have found is if you're open to opportunities, working with the right team, the right leadership, can really expose you to new areas and help you appreciate other areas of marketing that may not be the one that you are most familiar with.

If you're a digital marketer and there's an opportunity for you to work in analyst relations, work in the events team, or to work in field marketing, seize those opportunities. Every single one of those facets can bring value and, as a CMO, you need to understand the end-to-end and how all those functions play well together and the thread between all of those functions.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> What are some of the top resources that you rely on from a marketing perspective?
<blockquote>
<h3>Nothing beats a peer network. Building a great network of other marketers is fantastic, and it really needs to be an authentic network. @alexandra_gobbi</h3>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> You know, I think nothing beats a peer network. Building a great network of other marketers is fantastic, and it really needs to be an authentic network.

I have found over my career that people I've worked with or people I've had the opportunity to interact with and to get to know are the people that I can just pick up the phone or send a quick text to and say, hey, I'm struggling with this. Do you have any advice, or, who do you know that does this type of work, or what are some of the metrics that you use? For those types of questions, I think my network been great for me.

I would also say that I've really gained a huge appreciation for all of the organizations that make marketing successful, whether it's your PR agency, your digital agency, or your demand gen agency. I've had fantastic partners along the way that I've come to rely on, and that have really educated me in a lot of areas that have been key to my success or to our organization's success. So those will be some of the people that I would reach out to.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> What are some of your top digital marketing priorities for 2020? What are some high level areas that you feel like you're really going to focus on?

<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> We just implemented ABM technology last year and it's been phenomenal in terms of the impact that it's already had through initial pilots and now the rollout to the organization. I think continuing to hone our account-based marketing skills is going to be a key priority, and really thinking about how we apply our core demand gen engine paired with account based marketing to be successful. What does that look like in terms of ABM 2.0, if you will, in terms of website personalization and all of those things. That would be one of the key priorities that we have for next year.

I would say a second priority is continuing to simplify our portfolio. Secureworks has a very broad portfolio of end-to end-products and solutions in the security operations space. I think, from a marketing perspective, the more we can simplify and bundle offerings the easier we make it to position and digest end-to-end value propositions for our sellers as well as full marketing is always going to be another priority for us.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> That makes sense. My last question for you, Alex, is what are you most excited about for the upcoming B2B SMX conference in Boston?

<strong>Alex Gobbi:</strong> Well, as you know, when you and I first spoke of, you know, this is my first B2B Sales and Marketing Exchange. So for me, it's really very exciting to attend and get to know the perspective of some of my peers as well as some of the other presenters. I love that it is purely B2B focused and I actually love that it is marketing and sales focused. So I think just in general, the whole theme and the concept for the conference is something that I'm excited about, and building new connections.

<strong>Lee Odden:</strong> Fantastic. Thank you for your time, Alex!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-26808 aligncenter" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/building-editorial-calendar.png" alt="Building an Editorial Calendar" width="600" height="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I can’t believe I got fired from the calendar factory. All I did was take a day off!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Opening today’s post up with a bit of levity felt fitting, because calendars can cause much anxiety. They bring to mind deadlines, meticulous organization, and time crunches, which are often oppressive realities for marketers with a million things on their plates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But the truth is that you’re likely to encounter much more dread if you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;don’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;house your content planning within a documented and strategic editorial calendar for blogging. Building out a set schedule (with a bit of flexibility) ultimately makes your life easier because it provides a guiding light, and ensures your content strategy remains cohesive and oriented around your objectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In other words, editorial calendars are no joke. Here’s how you can construct one that seriously drives your company’s blog (or any other content initiative) forward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Fortify Your Editorial Calendar in Five Steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Whether you’ve already got a content calendar, which you hope to refine and improve, or you’re starting from scratch, these five steps will put you on track.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Step 1: Crystallize Your Objectives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The biggest issue with many content plans is that they’re aimless and wayward. When you’re figuring things out on the fly, it can be difficult to tie everything back to the same goals and desired outcomes. So the first step is to zoom out and nail down what you’re trying to achieve with the content in question. For instance, if your blog is designed to generate leads with specific audiences, are you tethering each piece on your calendar back to this outcome in some way? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Placing objectives front-and-center is a key benefit of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/b2b-content-marketing-strategy-checklist/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;documenting your content strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and making them the underpinning of your planning will help ensure everything you publish has a purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-home-alone-christmas-movies-xUySTOigOUHucl3rfW"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Step 2: Chart Your Pillars and Timely Focuses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;With objectives clearly defined, you can formulate content pillars that will serve as the cornerstones of your editorial calendar. Also known as topic clusters, these are the general categories that all of your content will nest under. Pillars are determined by the intersection of what you want to be known for, and where demand exists. They should be informed by SEO research around keywords and queries, hitting the sweet spot between search volume, expertise, and buying intent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Here on the TopRank Marketing Blog, our pillars are aligned with our agency’s core services — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/content-marketing/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;content marketing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/search-engine-optimization/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/influencer-marketing/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;influencer marketing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; — and so pretty much everything we create for the blog approaches these topics from various angles for people who are interested in learning about them and looking for insight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Don’t view content pillars as restricting; there are a wide range of ways you can address almost any topic, either directly or tangentially. Organizing your calendar around them will help ensure you stay focused, and relevant to your target audience. In addition to identifying a topical mix, you can start to define your content types — how-tos, thought leadership, influencer collaborations, conversion-driven pieces, etc. These can be aligned with various stages of the buying cycle, and mapped back to the key objectives established in Step 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At this point, it’s also smart to map out industry events or seasonal milestones that you’ll want to create content around. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="Don’t view content pillars as restricting; there are a wide range of ways you can address almost any topic, either directly or tangentially. @NickNelsonMN #ContentMarketing #ContentPlanning" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Step 3: Coordinate with Your Broader Strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This is a vital consideration that is all too frequently overlooked. Whatever channel you’re scheduling content for — be it a blog, email, social, etc. — think about ways you can coordinate with other departments or disciplines in the organization. For example, does your sales team experience higher volumes of inquiries at certain times of year? Or are they attending a trade show next month that you could support with content? Maybe one of your executives will be speaking at a conference, and you want to queue up some thought leadership around the subject of their talk in the days leading up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A strong editorial calendar should reflect the company holistically. In this sense, it can be helpful to make your calendar visible to everyone and not just the folks on your team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="A strong editorial calendar should reflect the company holistically. @NickNelsonMN #ContentMarketing #ContentPlanning " username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Step 4: Plot Your Cadence and Schedule Out Your Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;How often will you create content? And why? We all know it’s valuable to publish regularly, because this is how you build an invested and trusting audience, but “regularly” can mean different things under different circumstances. Is it daily? Three times a week? Multiple times per day? This decision shouldn’t driven by guesswork, but by data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Although it’s a little older now, HubSpot has a helpful post on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;determining how often companies should blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; based on variables like company size and B2B vs. B2C. But you’ll also want to dig into your own visitor behavior analytics and draw conclusions on what your audience wants. Test different cadences and compare the impacts. As a general rule, more publishing equals more traffic, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be worth your while to create new content each day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfred_lua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Alfred Lua&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; of Buffer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://buffer.com/resources/buffer-blog-one-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;writes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: “I would recommend experimenting and finding a suitable editorial cadence based on your content goals and the amount of time you have. There is no one right editorial cadence. HubSpot publishes several articles a day while Backlinko publishes less than once a month.” (As a side note, we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/best-answer-content-marketing-trust/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;highlighted Backlinko’s quality-over-quantity approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; here earlier this year.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Having made this decision, you can start filling out the calendar appropriately, using your content pillars and organizational directives as guides. Plan as far out as you’re comfortable (at least one month, but forecasting three or more months is even better). Make sure you’re building in enough topical variety to keep things fresh and diverse. Once you get your schedule documented, it becomes easy to spot gaps or overloads. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Step 5: Leave Room for Change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Note that you don’t want to completely fill out your editorial calendar. As we mentioned earlier, it’s important to leave some flexibility so you can nimbly address timely matters as they arise and account for the (expected) unexpected. Contently editor-in-chief &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JordanTeicher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Jordan Teicher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; proposes a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://contently.com/2019/03/13/content-calendar-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;75/25 rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, wherein one out of every four slots in your calendar is left blank. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In my years managing the site, I’m certain of one thing: s*** happens,” Teicher writes. “People miss deadlines. Sources don’t respond in time. The design team can’t find the right image. My day gets stuffed with meetings, which prevents me from editing a draft. A flexible content calendar is about more than just coming up with ideas for the current news cycle. It’s also about realistic expectations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Smart Practices for Getting the Most Out of Your Editorial Calendar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The five steps above will help you solidify your calendar. Here are a few additional tips to help make the process smoother and more effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hold group brainstorming sessions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Usually, the toughest thing about building out a content calendar is coming up with enough concepts to fill it in. I recommend setting up a time where a bunch of your creatives come together to load up the pipeline with ideas (run these ideas past your content pillars and SEO research to assess strategic viability). Make sure to incorporate voices from various departments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slice up and repurpose.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; It’s always valuable to get the most mileage possible out of your content. If you’ve got a big, meaty blog post planned on a certain subject, why not divvy it up into three parts and run it as a series? If you’re looking for a reliable performer next month, why not take your most successful piece from last month and flip it into an infographic, or conceive a follow-up post that expands on it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/11/repurposing-content-marketing-leftovers/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Repurposing is a great way to get the most out of your content leftovers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lean on the right tools. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For some content teams, a spreadsheet or even a Word doc can be sufficient for organizing your editorial calendar. In other cases, this initiative can be run through your project management software. But for high-volume teams with many elements to track and account for, it might be helpful to go with a dedicated content-centric solution. There are plenty of them out there, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://contently.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Contently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://divvyhq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;DivvyHQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kapost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Kapost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://coschedule.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;CoSchedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create comprehensive coverage. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What this looks like can vary in different scenarios. It might mean approaching your topical pillars with best-answer content that addresses every subtopic your customers are interested in learning about (especially those queries carrying any level of purchase intent). If you’re in a crowded niche, it might mean gobbling up every bit of white space your competitors are missing. If your content is oriented toward B2B buyers, it might mean creating content for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/buyers-versus-buying-committees/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;every role on distributed buying committees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and speaking to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/07/content-planning-long-sales-cycles/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;each stage of a lengthy purchase cycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Right on Schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If you feel apprehensive about building an editorial calendar from scratch, you’re not alone. It can feel intimidating to schedule out so far in advance, and to consistently manage and maintain this resource. But I assure you, once you get into the groove, your life will be much easier and your results will improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Following the steps and recommendations above will help you stay on target and derive maximum value from your efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t believe I got fired from the calendar factory. All I did was take a day off!</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening today’s post up with a bit of levity felt fitting, because calendars can cause much anxiety. They bring to mind deadlines, meticulous organization, and time crunches, which are often oppressive realities for marketers with a million things on their plates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the truth is that you’re likely to encounter much more dread if you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">house your content planning within a documented and strategic editorial calendar for blogging. Building out a set schedule (with a bit of flexibility) ultimately makes your life easier because it provides a guiding light, and ensures your content strategy remains cohesive and oriented around your objectives.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, editorial calendars are no joke. Here’s how you can construct one that seriously drives your company’s blog (or any other content initiative) forward. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortify Your Editorial Calendar in Five Steps</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’ve already got a content calendar, which you hope to refine and improve, or you’re starting from scratch, these five steps will put you on track.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Crystallize Your Objectives</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest issue with many content plans is that they’re aimless and wayward. When you’re figuring things out on the fly, it can be difficult to tie everything back to the same goals and desired outcomes. So the first step is to zoom out and nail down what you’re trying to achieve with the content in question. For instance, if your blog is designed to generate leads with specific audiences, are you tethering each piece on your calendar back to this outcome in some way? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing objectives front-and-center is a key benefit of </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/b2b-content-marketing-strategy-checklist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documenting your content strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and making them the underpinning of your planning will help ensure everything you publish has a purpose. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Chart Your Pillars and Timely Focuses</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With objectives clearly defined, you can formulate content pillars that will serve as the cornerstones of your editorial calendar. Also known as topic clusters, these are the general categories that all of your content will nest under. Pillars are determined by the intersection of what you want to be known for, and where demand exists. They should be informed by SEO research around keywords and queries, hitting the sweet spot between search volume, expertise, and buying intent.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here on the TopRank Marketing Blog, our pillars are aligned with our agency’s core services — </span><a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/content-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/search-engine-optimization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/influencer-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">influencer marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and so pretty much everything we create for the blog approaches these topics from various angles for people who are interested in learning about them and looking for insight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t view content pillars as restricting; there are a wide range of ways you can address almost any topic, either directly or tangentially. Organizing your calendar around them will help ensure you stay focused, and relevant to your target audience. In addition to identifying a topical mix, you can start to define your content types — how-tos, thought leadership, influencer collaborations, conversion-driven pieces, etc. These can be aligned with various stages of the buying cycle, and mapped back to the key objectives established in Step 1.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it’s also smart to map out industry events or seasonal milestones that you’ll want to create content around. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 3: Coordinate with Your Broader Strategy</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a vital consideration that is all too frequently overlooked. Whatever channel you’re scheduling content for — be it a blog, email, social, etc. — think about ways you can coordinate with other departments or disciplines in the organization. For example, does your sales team experience higher volumes of inquiries at certain times of year? Or are they attending a trade show next month that you could support with content? Maybe one of your executives will be speaking at a conference, and you want to queue up some thought leadership around the subject of their talk in the days leading up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong editorial calendar should reflect the company holistically. In this sense, it can be helpful to make your calendar visible to everyone and not just the folks on your team. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 4: Plot Your Cadence and Schedule Out Your Content</span></h3>

But you’ll also want to dig into your own visitor behavior analytics and draw conclusions on what your audience wants. Test different cadences and compare the impacts. As a general rule, more publishing equals more traffic, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll be worth your while to create new content each day. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://twitter.com/alfred_lua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfred Lua</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Buffer </span><a href="https://buffer.com/resources/buffer-blog-one-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “I would recommend experimenting and finding a suitable editorial cadence based on your content goals and the amount of time you have.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ew things in this world are as delicious as a corner piece of lasagna. For starters, the top layer of cheese is both gooey and crispy. The tomato sauce is sweet yet peppery. The meat? It’s flavorful and hearty. And don’t get me started on the ricotta and mozzarella layers—my favorite by far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/119i1S64KnIhyM" width="480" height="362" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Lasagna is the perfect dish. And its perfection is not just defined by quality ingredients, but how each ingredient is artfully layered together to bring satisfaction with each and every bite. That’s where the magic happens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cooking a delectable lasagna to perfection is not unlike crafting an integrated approach to content marketing. On their own, your tactics may whet your audience’s appetite, but don’t pack the tasty punch of working together to make a lasting impact or drive savory results. Paid, SEO, content, social, influencer, design—all need to work in tandem to ensure your marketing objectives are met.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What are the essential layers for a scrumptiously integrated content marketing lasagna? Here’s a little cooking demonstration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Layers of a Deliciously Integrated Content Marketing Lasagna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Layer No. 1: Structural SEO Noodles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Noodles are to lasagna as SEO is to content marketing. These are the support layers, helping bind the rest of tactical ingredients together while baking. They provide the structural integrity of the marketing dish—and add some much-loved, comforting carbohydrates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;From providing insights about the competitive landscape or revealing content or optimization opportunities based on your current search positioning, SEO tactics help provide context and actionable next steps for developing (and optimizing) your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/best-answer-strategy-b2b/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;best-answer content marketing strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. And without multiple layers of topical focus or the right contextual firmness, it all falls apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="Noodles are to lasagna as SEO is to content marketing. These are the support layers, helping bind the rest of tactical ingredients together while baking." username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Layer No. 2: Meaty and Savory Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Most of the nutritional value of lasagna is rooted in the meat—or vegetables if that’s your thing. (Yes, I choose to believe lasagna is very nutritious and essential for a healthy body.) When it comes to content marketing, the content you create is what brings value to your audience. It’s what gives them delectable insights, solutions, and answers to their burning questions as they make their journey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;However, to really succeed here, your content layer needs to be flavorful, well-seasoned, and fresh. It needs to be the best answer with a great user experience, impressive visuals, incredible storytelling, and valuable information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This means the flavor profile of your content needs to be multidimensional, including different content types (e.g. text, video, and/or audio, or interactive) and fit with your audience’s unique tastes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Layer No. 3: Saucy and Seasoned Influencers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;While well-seasoned meat and perfectly cooked pasta noodles can satisfy hunger in some cases, it does not yet make for a flavorful lasagna dish. This is where the tomato sauce comes in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/f9GU5uLpvtBtz3Z2lx" width="480" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/Friends-season-2-episode-10-the-one-with-russ-f9GU5uLpvtBtz3Z2lx"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic come together to make a delectable tomato sauce to mix with the meat and coat the noodles. But there’s one key ingredient content marketers can add to make an especially spicy sauce: Influencers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Influencers add authority, credibility, flavorful insight, and even more meat to your content. Their seasoned advice also helps bring new, untapped audiences to the dinner table. But the key here is to season with care. It’s important to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/how-select-b2b-influencers/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;select, qualify, and recruit the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;right &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;influencers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; depending on your goals, target audience, topic, and so on. Take their reach and follower size out of the equation—focus on the unique and relevant flavor they can bring to your content and audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="Identify the topics that are most important to your audience and how they align with the topics you want to be known for. Then identify the right types of relevant influencers. @azeckman" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Lay No. 4: Cheesy Brand Goodness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As I mentioned, the ricotta cheese mixture is my absolute favorite lasagna layer. This creamy goodness envelops the meat sauce, adding a subtle flavors and elevating the dish as a whole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Your brand voice and personality is this cheesy, creamy goodness. Your audience needs to get a taste of who you are and how you can help, without having their senses overpowered with product messaging and misplaced calls to action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;While under most circumstances I’d argue the more the merrier when it comes to cheese helpings, when it comes to crafting an integrated content marketing strategy that helps your brand shine, balance is the name of the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="Your audience needs to get a taste of who you are and how you can help, without having their senses overpowered with product messaging and misplaced calls to action. @annieleuman" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Layer No. 5: The Promotional Parmesan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You know when you’re eating at your favorite Italian restaurant and you’re asked if you’d like some fresh parmesan to top off your meal? Of course, you reply in the affirmative and wait until there’s a lovely dusting (or a solid coating if you’re like me) of freshly grated cheese for you to enjoy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;That final, top layer of cheese is key for any good lasagna or any integrated digital marketing strategy. But just because it’s the last layer added, doesn’t mean it’s an afterthought. Your promotional parm has been planned all along. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Organic social media. Email marketing. Paid social, search, or display ads. Third-party editorial. Influencer activation. Cross-site promotion. As you pull your freshly baked content marketing lasagna out of the oven, the tantalizing top layer is the first thing your audience will see. How will you attract your audience? How will you entice them to take a bite? How will you ensure they’re satisfied and asking for more?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="Content promotion can’t be effective if it’s an afterthought. Your best practice would be to make promotion part of content planning. @leeodden" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Cook Your Integrated Marketing Lasagna to Perfection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A well-crafted and delicious lasagna has expert layers, with each layer’s flavors and textures coming together to deliver perfection in every bite. A great content marketing strategy does, too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Leverage SEO tactics to provide foundational insights that can be built upon with meaty content. In addition, perfect your secret influencer sauce to coat your content and SEO noodles in flavor and insight. Finally, ensure your top layer of ooey gooey cheese is part of your cooking strategy from the beginning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In my experience, most marketers fancy themselves as lifelong learners, taking pride in innovating their work and skill set to maximize their impact. We keep tabs on emerging trends, tactics, and tools. We follow industry leaders for their insight. We consult our internal teams and external partners for advice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But there may be one specialty group we don’t look to for inspiration enough: The kids in our lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As a parent of two adorable monsters who are growing up way to fast, I’ve been reflecting a lot on how far they’ve come. Of course, I’ve realized that I’ve come far too, as both a parent and a marketer. And I’d wager that most of us have kids in our lives who have the potential to teach and remind us of some important things that can make us better humans and better at what we do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;So, what marketing lessons can the little ones in our lives pass on? Here are a few that have been illuminated for me recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;4 Marketing Lessons We Can Learn from Kids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;#1 - Foster permanent curiosity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Lately, on the 20-minute commute to daycare, we’ve been listening to “But Why?” It’s a fantastic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vpr.org/programs/why-podcast-curious-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;podcast by Vermont Public Radio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. It’s just incredible. Kids from all over North America send audio clips of themselves asking the most unexpected, puzzling, and just plain fun questions. This week we learned why we laugh, why boys and girls are different, and why sugar is bad for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Curiosity is one of the simplest and most powerful lessons we can learn from a child. As a marketer, this makes me ask: What can we do stay curious against a backdrop of back-to-back meetings, tight budgets, and the unending barrage of emails? There’s a lot of opportunity for curiosity to creep in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Professional Development: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Can you carve out a little time each week to drink a cup of coffee and surf your favorite industry publications for the latest news? Is there a certification or training that’s been on the backburner?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategic Innovation: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As you head into your quarterly or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/07/2020-marketing-strategy-planning/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;annual marketing strategy planning sessions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, how deep have you dug into why you’re making your recommendations? Or better yet, have you considered other possibilities? A way to innovate? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reflection and Growth: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We all experience our fair share of fire drills. We immediately spring into action, oftentimes without asking all the “why” questions. Furthermore, we may not take the time to look back to learn how we got there. What processes could be fine-tuned? What is the true cause of a marketing mishap? (Tip: I like to employ the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.groupmap.com/map-templates/urgent-important-matrix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Urgent Important Matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; attributed to President Eisenhower to help balance my day.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;#2 - Employ resilient trust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;When both of my babes were around 6 to 9 months old, they learned to jump into our laps, assisted by Mom or Dad’s hands securely around their waist. They were so proud of their amazing feats. And through repetition, they knew we’d always be there to catch them—even when they jumped unexpectedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Aided by their caretakers helping hands and guidance, kids learn new things and take risks, eventually without fear. Why? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because trust has been built&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In the marketing world, when trust is a focus, you can forge incredible bonds colleagues, clients or customers, prospects, and partners. And in a time when &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/02/trust-marketing-statistics/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;trust is dwindling among consumers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, it’s more critical than ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;#3 - Be coachable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My persistent (and often stubborn) children throw puzzle pieces. They shriek or scream, sometimes when they’re seemingly unprovoked. They make mistakes. But their curious, trusting nature makes them incredibly teachable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This magical trait is easy to lose once we hit the working world and get some experience under our belts. None of us probably think we’re perfect, but how well do you take feedback? If you want to get results for your company and your career, you need to be open to coaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For example, did your supervisor offer some constructive feedback?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rather than put up your defenses, open yourself up to the feedback. You can literally, open your posture (no crossed arms), face her or him directly, and show your listening. Even take notes if it helps!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Or did you get a string of bad customer reviews on social media? Acknowledge their concerns. Offer an opportunity to talk about it more in detail. Point them in the right direction to get help. This not only shows them that you want to create great experiences, but others can see your willingness to take feedback and work to make improvements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;#4 - Keep it simple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;My children never fail to remind me to simplify my life—and my marketing. Whether you’re a parent or caretaker, or you’re watching others raise their kids, we can all admit that parents over-think questions and scenarios all the time. What do I do when my kid asks me where babies come from? Why is that parent so concerned about a kid playing with a cardboard box? Am I a terrible parent for putting my kid in timeout five times today?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But the thing is: Kids often sees the world through the most basic lens. They don’t typically overthink things. They aren’t riddled with stress and anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This should be a reminder that we shouldn’t sweat the small stuff and that the simple answer is often the right answer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For example, you could spend 45 minutes responding to a curt email from a colleague or client, and then hours or days spinning as you wait for a response. Or you could ask the person in question to jump on the phone or huddle for a quick chat. This levels the playing field and limits the potential for misinterpreting signals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As another example, if you’re in the process of launching a major campaign, can you integrate various tactics to minimize and streamline the work? (Certainly, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/reduce-stress-hire-digital-marketing-agency/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;hiring a trusted agency partner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; could help with that. Wink.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Look to the Children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If you want to be a lifelong learner, sometimes you need to go back to basics. The children in our lives can teach us some incredible lessons about curiosity, trust, coachability, and simplicity that can improve our personal and professional lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What’s a marketing lesson that you’ve learned from a kid in your life? Tell us in the comments section below.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26781" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/CannesB2BMarketingC600w.jpg" alt="City of Cannes Aerial view Image" width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June the 2019 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity brought together some of the world’s savviest B2B marketers, brands, and other creative professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Nike, IKEA, and Visa to Tommy Hilfiger, Microsoft and Target, strong brands and the marketers behind them were involved at Cannes, and the trends they gathered to explore will play a part in shaping how B2B marketers focus their efforts in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a run-down of some of the top B2B marketing and other revelations from this year’s Cannes, and what they’ll mean for your business in 2020 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1 — Cannes B2B Marketing Brand Engagement Take-Aways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26782" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/BrandEngagement600w.jpg" alt="Brand Engagement Gear Cogs Image" width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One running theme at Cannes this year was centered around being mindful of your brand’s purpose, and how it will be especially important when it comes time to meet your audience’s needs and make the greatest impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a change-maker brand comes from &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/smart-question-research-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;honing in on consumer desires&lt;/a&gt;, so listen to the signals coming from the online platforms where your customers and potential clients spend the majority of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t entirely eschew machine learning when it comes to your data, but build brand trust by ensuring that appropriate and responsible humans have data oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look to feed off competitive momentum and focus conversations and cultural discussions using creativity, and keep it sincere when it comes to brand activism, while avoiding all hints of opportunism, many at Cannes urged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brand engagement, especially through influencer marketing, has been the focus of several recent articles we've published, including these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/07/intersection-abm-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Hitting Your Target: Why Account-Based Marketing and Influencers Are the Perfect Match&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/07/11-qualities-b2b-influencer-match/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;11 Qualities You Should be Looking for to Find Your B2B Influencer Match&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/influencer-marketing-trends-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;7 Top B2B Influencer Marketing Trends for 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2 — Cannes B2B Marketing Consumer Journey Take-Aways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26783" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/CustomerJourney600w.jpg" alt="Happy people and dog jumping together on the sunset beach Image" width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dig in and embrace the sometimes-messy digital world where your potential customers interact, by communicating with them and taking the time to learn about their lives through what they’re posting online, because cold and impersonal data can only get you so far in the customer journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These raw and real connections can unite and forge new relationships in ways that polished marketing campaigns sometimes just can’t, and some of &lt;a href="https://www.canneslions.com/enter/awards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the winners at Cannes&lt;/a&gt; showed examples of building these types of connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build strong brand value while also allowing customers to take the wheel, nurture the connections your brand makes, and don’t be afraid to &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/how-select-b2b-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;build strong creative partnerships&lt;/a&gt; in your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuing the participation of consumers while also standing by your brand’s values were among the trends explored during Cannes this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search taking place from smart speakers and other connected voice-assisted is &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/study-48-of-consumers-use-voice-assistants-for-general-web-search-319729" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;poised to boom in the coming years&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/promote-b2b-podcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;podcasting is expanding&lt;/a&gt; to offer new ways to integrate brand messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strive to build a seamless voice search approach that meshes with the values and messaging of your brand or that of your client, as sound is the newest frontier for B2B marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're written about smart search recently, including in these helpful articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3 — Cannes B2B Marketing Diversity Take-Aways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26784" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Diversity600w.jpg" alt="Colorful diverse finger prints image." width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannes made efforts to find and highlight the areas in marketing where diversity continues to be lacking, led by people over 50 and those who are differently-abled, and spent considerable time exploring how setting aside fear and risk can lead to huge economic and strategic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going beyond hiring, diversity should move towards being more of a core piece of a brand’s values, some of those gathered at Cannes noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding diversity &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/03/content-marketing-dashboard-prove-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;key performance indicators (KPIs)&lt;/a&gt; to existing performance metrics would go a long way towards making inclusiveness an important part of opportunity pipelines, and ultimately bottom lines, it was noted during Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 — Cannes B2B Marketing Long-Term Planning Take-Aways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25271" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/FollowingGuidelines600w.jpg" alt="Mountain hiker with map at guideposts." width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connections coming from &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/underutilized-b2b-content-promotion-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;unexpected places and new experiences&lt;/a&gt; are poised to change how B2B marketers expand beyond traditional sources, and an emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/07/firework-marketing-moments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the power of creativity to strengthen organizations&lt;/a&gt; was made at Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands and how they reflect culture at large will become more of a joint initiative at successful firms and in strong marketing efforts, especially in creative campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannes showed that creativity will likely thrive in the coming year, even more-so when it’s increasingly expressed as a team effort, done in what some gathered for the week called real-time branding, with all involved having a creative stake in new marketing initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a &lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/content-marketing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;relevant and flexible B2B marketing strategy&lt;/a&gt;, and building innovative creative methods whether working solo or with an agency, were also take-aways from Cannes this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've explored both long-term planning and the question of when is the right time to partner with an agency, in recent articles such as these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/09/boost-content-marketing-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;How to Boost Your Content Marketing Efforts By Planning Ahead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5 — Cannes B2B Marketing Storytelling Take-Aways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26785" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Storytelling600w.jpg" alt="Share Your Story image." width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cannes a more transformational flavor of storytelling was seen as coming down the pike, one that will help evolve the narrative with more levels of both client and customer experience, all combining to bring better communication to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapidly-expanding digital technologies and more data than ever present challenges, but also massive opportunities, especially when the two combine to help creative storytelling efforts that help drive B2B marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating compelling narratives and delivering them in new and relevant ways will play a factor in marketing in 2020 and beyond, and firms utilizing solely technology to overcome marketing barriers may be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to better &lt;strong&gt;recognize the people behind the data and the numbers&lt;/strong&gt; was also seen as a key trend at Cannes, along with greater incorporation of empathy and intuition in marketing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroaesthetics and an evolving method of storytelling that is &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/02/always-on-influencer-marketing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;always-on&lt;/a&gt; will expand on traditional forms of narratives that have been largely limited to a beginning, middle, and end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micro-storytelling efforts will also help brands shows that they are listening, and encourage consumers to create and share their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of our helpful looks at storytelling in marketing are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cannes the power of trust played a major role this year, and how to regain it using transparency, authenticity, and empathy, after being compromised over the past several years in the eyes of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A theme that resonated throughout the week was that nothing secures a relationship as powerfully as trust, which is the cornerstone of any long-term partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust in platforms and technology were also at the forefront on Cannes this year, and admonitions to shift to marketing strategies that are more real, open, transparent, and true were common themes for rebuilding broken trust.&lt;/p&gt;

In June the 2019 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity brought together some of the world’s savviest B2B marketers, brands, and other creative professionals.

From Nike, IKEA, and Visa to Tommy Hilfiger, Microsoft and Target, strong brands and the marketers behind them were involved at Cannes, and the trends they gathered to explore will play a part in shaping how B2B marketers focus their efforts in the months and years ahead.

Here’s a run-down of some of the top B2B marketing and other revelations from this year’s Cannes, and what they’ll mean for your business in 2020 and beyond.
<h2>1 — Cannes B2B Marketing Brand Engagement Take-Aways</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26782" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/BrandEngagement600w.jpg" alt="Brand Engagement Gear Cogs Image" width="600" height="360" />

One running theme at Cannes this year was centered around being mindful of your brand’s purpose, and how it will be especially important when it comes time to meet your audience’s needs and make the greatest impact.

Being a change-maker brand comes from <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/smart-question-research-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">honing in on consumer desires</a>, so listen to the signals coming from the online platforms where your customers and potential clients spend the majority of their time.

Don’t entirely eschew machine learning when it comes to your data, but build brand trust by ensuring that appropriate and responsible humans have data oversight.

Look to feed off competitive momentum and focus conversations and cultural discussions using creativity, and keep it sincere when it comes to brand activism, while avoiding all hints of opportunism, many at Cannes urged.

Brand engagement, especially through influencer marketing, has been the focus of several recent articles we've published, including these:

</ul>
<h2>2 — Cannes B2B Marketing Consumer Journey Take-Aways</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26783" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/CustomerJourney600w.jpg" alt="Happy people and dog jumping together on the sunset beach Image" width="600" height="360" />

Dig in and embrace the sometimes-messy digital world where your potential customers interact, by communicating with them and taking the time to learn about their lives through what they’re posting online, because cold and impersonal data can only get you so far in the customer journey.

These raw and real connections can unite and forge new relationships in ways that polished marketing campaigns sometimes just can’t, and some of <a href="https://www.canneslions.com/enter/awards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the winners at Cannes</a> showed examples of building these types of connections.

Build strong brand value while also allowing customers to take the wheel, nurture the connections your brand makes, and don’t be afraid to <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/how-select-b2b-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build strong creative partnerships</a> in your efforts.

Valuing the participation of consumers while also standing by your brand’s values were among the trends explored during Cannes this year.

Search taking place from smart speakers and other connected voice-assisted is <a href="https://searchengineland.com/study-48-of-consumers-use-voice-assistants-for-general-web-search-319729" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poised to boom in the coming years</a>, and <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/promote-b2b-podcast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">podcasting is expanding</a> to offer new ways to integrate brand messaging.

Strive to build a seamless voice search approach that meshes with the values and messaging of your brand or that of your client, as sound is the newest frontier for B2B marketers.

We're written about smart search recently, including in these helpful articles:

<h2>3 — Cannes B2B Marketing Diversity Take-Aways</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26784" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Diversity600w.jpg" alt="Colorful diverse finger prints image." width="600" height="360" />

Cannes made efforts to find and highlight the areas in marketing where diversity continues to be lacking, led by people over 50 and those who are differently-abled, and spent considerable time exploring how setting aside fear and risk can lead to huge economic and strategic opportunities.

Going beyond hiring, diversity should move towards being more of a core piece of a brand’s values, some of those gathered at Cannes noted.

Adding diversity <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/03/content-marketing-dashboard-prove-roi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a> to existing performance metrics would go a long way towards making inclusiveness an important part of opportunity pipelines, and ultimately bottom lines, it was noted during Cannes.
<h2>4 — Cannes B2B Marketing Long-Term Planning Take-Aways</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25271" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/FollowingGuidelines600w.jpg" alt="Mountain hiker with map at guideposts." width="600" height="360" />

Connections coming from <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/underutilized-b2b-content-promotion-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unexpected places and new experiences</a> are poised to change how B2B marketers expand beyond traditional sources, and an emphasis on <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/07/firework-marketing-moments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the power of creativity to strengthen organizations</a> was made at Cannes.

Brands and how they reflect culture at large will become more of a joint initiative at successful firms and in strong marketing efforts, especially in creative campaigns.

Cannes showed that creativity will likely thrive in the coming year, even more-so when it’s increasingly expressed as a team effort, done in what some gathered for the week called real-time branding, with all involved having a creative stake in new marketing initiatives.

Having a <a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/content-marketing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relevant and flexible B2B marketing strategy</a>, and building innovative creative methods whether working solo or with an agency, were also take-aways from Cannes this year.

We've explored both long-term planning and the question of when is the right time to partner with an agency, in recent articles such as these:

<h2>5 — Cannes B2B Marketing Storytelling Take-Aways</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26785" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Storytelling600w.jpg" alt="Share Your Story image." width="600" height="360" />

At Cannes a more transformational flavor of storytelling was seen as coming down the pike, one that will help evolve the narrative with more levels of both client and customer experience, all combining to bring better communication to consumers.

Rapidly-expanding digital technologies and more data than ever present challenges, but also massive opportunities, especially when the two combine to help creative storytelling efforts that help drive B2B marketing efforts.

Creating compelling narratives and delivering them in new and relevant ways will play a factor in marketing in 2020 and beyond, and firms utilizing solely technology to overcome marketing barriers may be left behind.

Learning to better <strong>recognize the people behind the data and the numbers</strong> was also seen as a key trend at Cannes, along with greater incorporation of empathy and intuition in marketing processes.

Neuroaesthetics and an evolving method of storytelling that is <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/02/always-on-influencer-marketing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">always-on</a> will expand on traditional forms of narratives that have been largely limited to a beginning, middle, and end.

Micro-storytelling efforts will also help brands shows that they are listening, and encourage consumers to create and share their own stories.

We’ve focused more than ever on <strong>trust in marketing</strong> over the past year at TopRank Marketing, with pieces such as these:

A theme that resonated throughout the week was that nothing secures a relationship as powerfully as trust, which is the cornerstone of any long-term partnership.

Trust in platforms and technology were also at the forefront on Cannes this year, and admonitions to shift to marketing strategies that are more real, open, transparent, and true were common themes for rebuilding broken trust.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-26779 aligncenter" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/trust-funnel.png" alt="Say Hello to the Trust Funnel" width="600" height="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The marketing funnel as we know it is gone. Or at least it needs to be, if we as marketers want to move toward a truly customer-centric operation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In this new installment of our Trust Factors series, we'll review the conventional models for customer acquisition and explain why they're going out of style. Then, we'll present an updated version, geared toward long-term sustainable growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Funnel Fallacy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We're all accustomed to funnels: marketing funnels, sales funnels, conversion funnels. These frameworks can be helpful in guiding our strategies, but there's an inherent disconnect at play: they tend to commoditize our customers, because these models are solely focused on the end result (revenue). Traditionally, the funnel is designed to usher prospects from awareness, to consideration, to purchase, and then the job is done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In today's buyer-controlled landscape, where retention and advocacy are at a premium, marketers need to align with every other customer-facing business unit to ensure trust is being built at each interaction — including (and especially) those after the purchase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="In today's buyer-controlled landscape, where retention and advocacy are at a premium, #marketers need to align with every other customer-facing business unit to ensure trust is being built at each interaction. @NickNelsonMN" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What is the Trust Funnel?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This theme has been covered in the past from a variety of different viewpoints (including a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Funnel-Leverage-Currency-Attention/dp/1630472972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;book by Brian G. Johnson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;), but we’ve got our own spin on it. By our definition, the trust funnel is a reconfiguration of the buying cycle, with a shift in orientation and objective. The focus here is not only generating sales, but also, generating trust (which leads to the same result). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At TopRank Marketing, we follow a modified version of the traditional marketing funnel, extending it beyond the purchase stage and accounting for the full customer lifecycle:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Attract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Convert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Advocacy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-26778" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/TRM_Trust-Funnel.jpg" alt="The Trust Funnel for B2B Marketing" width="600" height="495" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The trust funnel is essentially aimed at optimizing each of the first three stages to support the last two by inspiring loyalty and cultivating long-term relationships throughout. Why is this important? Because successfully mastering this process is the key to running an efficient and sustainable business. Consider that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by 25%-95%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Meanwhile, studies show that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://zuberance.com/zuberrants/category/what-is-a-customer-advocacy-program-and-why-you-need-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;customer-referred leads are far more likely to convert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and deliver considerably higher lifetime value on average.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In short, an effective customer retention and advocacy model helps your marketing become more self-sufficient. Trust unlocks this ideal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Optimizing for Each Stage of the Trust Funnel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Adopting the trust funnel methodology is all about a shift in mindset. The stages are not fundamentally different than those in the aforementioned marketing funnel, at a high level, but you’ll be better positioned to serve your customers when thinking about them in these terms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;1. Attract: Foundational Credibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Awareness” is a broad and ambiguous concept. It’s not enough to simply make people aware of our brands — we need to instill an immediate sense of credibility, so that trust is being established in the very first interactions. How can we accomplish this? Focus on three vital touchpoints:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Website. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Does it convey authority of expertise in your vertical? Is it easily navigable, with quick access to resources that a curious buyer might want? Are there seamless methods to get in touch? If the site contains contact fields, do you clearly outline your commitment to privacy and care when handling a user’s personal data?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Social Media Accounts. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At any given time, your latest tweet or update might be the first time a new prospect experiences your brand. As such, it’s important to be thoughtful with each one. Make sure your voice is consistent, genuine, and directly aligned with your target audience. Are you approachable and conversant?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Search Visibility. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As we wrote here recently, your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/best-answer-content-marketing-trust/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;presence in search results is instrumental to your brand’s credibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Are you delivering best answer content that satisfies search intent for prioritized phrases? Consequently, are you outranking competitors for these terms? Do your page titles and meta descriptions reflect an inviting and knowledgeable demeanor? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;2. Engage: Authenticity and Conversations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once you’ve taken the appropriate steps to develop an air of credibility, it’s time to cement this perception as people begin to engage with your brand. Seize these opportunities to do so:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be Available and Responsive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Candace Lun Plotkin of McKinsey &amp;amp; Company published a post on LinkedIn recently discussing the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/b2b-customers-want-fast-reaction-times-how-can-sales-leaders-plotkin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;growing expectation of B2B customers for rapid response times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. In the age of an on-demand economy, people are conditioned for short waits and fast access to what they need. This is why an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/02/always-on-influencer-marketing/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;always-on marketing strategy is highly advisable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and why digital tools like chatbots and predictive technologies are gaining prominence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Employee Engagement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; As users start to immerse themselves more deeply into your brand and its content, they’ll likely start encountering your employees, either directly or through social media. When the people who work for a business embody its philosophies and values, and are actively engaged in the work, it’s a major affirmation of authenticity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Influencer Partnerships. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Working with the right influencers, who are familiar to and respected by your audience, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/b2b-influencer-marketing-trust-factor/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;also provides a major credibility assist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; as they compare solutions. Note that in order to achieve this purpose, your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/how-avoid-fauxthenticity-pitfalls/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;influencer partnerships need to feel natural and not forced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Also, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;influencers play a key role at every stage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; of the trust funnel, but their recognition and built-in authority are especially crucial in separating your solution from others at this pivotal stage of deliberation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;3. Convert: Transparency and Comfort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As a prospect moves closer to making a decision, the stakes are raised. By now a buyer (or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/buyers-versus-buying-committees/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;buying committee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;) has likely been engaging with your brand, and they are feeling the pressure that accompanies making a major business purchase decision. It is imperative to build comfort at this stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be Open and Honest. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The last thing you want to do at this point is make a buyer feel like there are hidden concerns or reasons for reservation. One key opportunity is to acknowledge and address negative reviews of your product/service. As our CEO &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leeodden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Lee Odden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; put it in his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/content-marketing-thought-leaders/2019/lee-odden-on-linkedins-place-in-the-bigger-marketing-picture"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Sophisticated Marketers interview with LinkedIn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: “Millennial and Gen Z audiences expect brands to be honest and forthcoming. While some companies view information that is not a glowing endorsement of the brand as a liability, others are embracing those challenges as an opportunity to be transparent about issues and how they’re being solved. That transparency builds trust and confidence in the brand, key differentiators for customers who become loyal advocates.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lean on Case Studies and Testimonials.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Of course, positive and reinforcing examples of happy customers will be your strongest assets at this stage, so you’ll want to have plenty on hand — ideally, covering a variety of different challenges and scenarios, so you can match them up to the prospect in question for maximum resonance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frictionless Purchase Process. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;How easy is it for someone to make a purchase from your company? Take whatever steps you can to make it painless and simple, so that a person going through it never stops and wonders, “What’s going on here?” Test relentlessly and gather feedback from existing customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;4. Retain: Follow-through and Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;One of the most prevalent missteps for brands and marketers is a failure to account for the post-sale customer experience. The attitude that once a sale is complete it’s time to move on is misguided. This is, in fact, perhaps your most critical moment to make a positive impact. Given that everyone is aware of the relative cost difference between selling to a repeat customer and acquiring a new one, it’s kind of crazy how few marketers prioritize this stage. Note that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Listen-to-the-Voice-of-the-Customer-53239.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;according to one study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, 68% of customer defections occur because customers perceive “an attitude of indifference.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assist with Implementation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Do you have at least one person on your staff who is solely dedicated to ensuring customers are able to implement and leverage your solution without issue? Can the customer easily get in touch with this person, and troubleshoot quickly? Although these activities don’t necessarily fall directly under the purview of marketing, there is a fair amount of overlap (social media, customer resources, integrations, etc.) and it’s an essential aspect of the customer experience so it’s important for marketers to have visibility and influence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create a Loyalty Loop.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; This convention is at the center of our friend &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrewDavisHere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Andrew Davis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;’s marketing philosophy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://divvyhq.com/2018/10/tips-from-andrew-davis-on-leveling-up-content-with-the-loyalty-loop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As he puts it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;: “You serve your audience and subscribers first,” rather than constantly emphasizing the importance of new eyeballs and new business. Basically, the Loyalty Loop is about taking advantage of that “moment of inspiration” right after someone commits to your brand, by delighting them and reinforcing the decision. The idea is that as a result, the next time they have a need, they won’t even consider your competition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offer Post-Purchase Content. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This is one &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/11/how-content-retain-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;smart retention tactic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; recommended by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarciaRJohnston" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Marcia Riefer Johnston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; in a piece for Content Marketing Institute. Post-purchase content can include things like care and maintenance instructions, set-up guides, and repair help. This type of content can line up functionally with either, or both, of the bullets above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;5. Advocacy: Relationship Maintenance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Customer advocates are incredibly valuable, but also exceedingly rare. These are the people who will autonomously recommend your brand to others, and sing your praises publicly without prompting. In some cases this will happen organically because they simply love your offering so dang much, but more often, you need to develop this deep brand affinity through ongoing engagement and relationship-building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay in Touch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Don’t just reach out because their renewal is coming up and you want them to buy from you again. Use a birthday, anniversary, or job change as a prompt to check in and say hello. Provide helpful content just for the sake of doing it. You should aspire to be an advocate for your customer if you want them to do the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offer Customer Newsletters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; This is a great way to stay in touch at scale. Email marketing is generally viewed as a lead generation tactic but it’s also an excellent channel for increasing loyalty. Make sure the content in your newsletter for existing customers is purposeful and value-oriented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promote Customer Accomplishments. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The primary issue with most case studies is that they’re so focused on the solution, rather than the customer who used it. You’ll build more affinity by highlighting the user’s accomplishment — how they smartly handled a problem and got the most out of your product or service. Heck, you can even promote achievements by your customers that don’t involve your solution. Get the good vibes rolling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Put Trust First, and the Results Will Follow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;When companies are focused on sales and revenues and bottom lines, it becomes apparent in the way they operate. This is why the “sales funnel” or "marketing funnel" concept is one I find myself referencing less and less these days. The true end-goals of any savvy modern marketing strategy are to inspire loyalty, affinity, and advocacy. The trust funnel is built to do just that. As a natural result, the sales, revenue, and bottom-line impact will follow — consistently, and over the long haul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Trust me on that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The marketing funnel as we know it is gone. Or at least it needs to be, if we as marketers want to move toward a truly customer-centric operation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this new installment of our Trust Factors series, we'll review the conventional models for customer acquisition and explain why they're going out of style. Then, we'll present an updated version, geared toward long-term sustainable growth.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Funnel Fallacy</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We're all accustomed to funnels: marketing funnels, sales funnels, conversion funnels. These frameworks can be helpful in guiding our strategies, but there's an inherent disconnect at play: they tend to commoditize our customers, because these models are solely focused on the end result (revenue). Traditionally, the funnel is designed to usher prospects from awareness, to consideration, to purchase, and then the job is done. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In today's buyer-controlled landscape, where retention and advocacy are at a premium, marketers need to align with every other customer-facing business unit to ensure trust is being built at each interaction — including (and especially) those after the purchase.</span>

[bctt tweet="In today's buyer-controlled landscape, where retention and advocacy are at a premium, #marketers need to align with every other customer-facing business unit to ensure trust is being built at each interaction. @NickNelsonMN" username="toprank"]
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Trust Funnel?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This theme has been covered in the past from a variety of different viewpoints (including a </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Funnel-Leverage-Currency-Attention/dp/1630472972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">book by Brian G. Johnson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but we’ve got our own spin on it. By our definition, the trust funnel is a reconfiguration of the buying cycle, with a shift in orientation and objective. The focus here is not only generating sales, but also, generating trust (which leads to the same result). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At TopRank Marketing, we follow a modified version of the traditional marketing funnel, extending it beyond the purchase stage and accounting for the full customer lifecycle:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attract</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convert</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retain</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocacy</span></li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-26778" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/TRM_Trust-Funnel.jpg" alt="The Trust Funnel for B2B Marketing" width="600" height="495" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The trust funnel is essentially aimed at optimizing each of the first three stages to support the last two by inspiring loyalty and cultivating long-term relationships throughout. Why is this important? Because successfully mastering this process is the key to running an efficient and sustainable business. Consider that </span><a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by 25%-95%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, studies show that </span><a href="https://zuberance.com/zuberrants/category/what-is-a-customer-advocacy-program-and-why-you-need-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer-referred leads are far more likely to convert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and deliver considerably higher lifetime value on average.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, an effective customer retention and advocacy model helps your marketing become more self-sufficient. Trust unlocks this ideal.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing for Each Stage of the Trust Funnel</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting the trust funnel methodology is all about a shift in mindset. The stages are not fundamentally different than those in the aforementioned marketing funnel, at a high level, but you’ll be better positioned to serve your customers when thinking about them in these terms:</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Attract: Foundational Credibility</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awareness” is a broad and ambiguous concept. It’s not enough to simply make people aware of our brands — we need to instill an immediate sense of credibility, so that trust is being established in the very first interactions. How can we accomplish this? Focus on three vital touchpoints:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Your Website. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it convey authority of expertise in your vertical? Is it easily navigable, with quick access to resources that a curious buyer might want? Are there seamless methods to get in touch? If the site contains contact fields, do you clearly outline your commitment to privacy and care when handling a user’s personal data?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Your Social Media Accounts. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any given time, your latest tweet or update might be the first time a new prospect experiences your brand. As such, it’s important to be thoughtful with each one. Make sure your voice is consistent, genuine, and directly aligned with your target audience. Are you approachable and conversant?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Your Search Visibility. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we wrote here recently, your </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/best-answer-content-marketing-trust/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presence in search results is instrumental to your brand’s credibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Are you delivering best answer content that satisfies search intent for prioritized phrases? Consequently, are you outranking competitors for these terms? Do your page titles and meta descriptions reflect an inviting and knowledgeable demeanor? </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Engage: Authenticity and Conversations</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve taken the appropriate steps to develop an air of credibility, it’s time to cement this perception as people begin to engage with your brand. Seize these opportunities to do so:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Be Available and Responsive.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Candace Lun Plotkin of McKinsey &amp; Company published a post on LinkedIn recently discussing the </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/b2b-customers-want-fast-reaction-times-how-can-sales-leaders-plotkin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing expectation of B2B customers for rapid response times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the age of an on-demand economy, people are conditioned for short waits and fast access to what they need. This is why an </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/02/always-on-influencer-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">always-on marketing strategy is highly advisable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and why digital tools like chatbots and predictive technologies are gaining prominence.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Employee Engagement.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As users start to immerse themselves more deeply into your brand and its content, they’ll likely start encountering your employees, either directly or through social media. When the people who work for a business embody its philosophies and values, and are actively engaged in the work, it’s a major affirmation of authenticity. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Influencer Partnerships. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with the right influencers, who are familiar to and respected by your audience, </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/b2b-influencer-marketing-trust-factor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also provides a major credibility assist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they compare solutions. Note that in order to achieve this purpose, your </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/how-avoid-fauxthenticity-pitfalls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">influencer partnerships need to feel natural and not forced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, </span><b>influencers play a key role at every stage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the trust funnel, but their recognition and built-in authority are especially crucial in separating your solution from others at this pivotal stage of deliberation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Convert: Transparency and Comfort</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a prospect moves closer to making a decision, the stakes are raised. By now a buyer (or </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/buyers-versus-buying-committees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buying committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) has likely been engaging with your brand, and they are feeling the pressure that accompanies making a major business purchase decision. It is imperative to build comfort at this stage. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Be Open and Honest. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing you want to do at this point is make a buyer feel like there are hidden concerns or reasons for reservation. One key opportunity is to acknowledge and address negative reviews of your product/service. As our CEO </span><a href="https://twitter.com/leeodden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Odden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put it in his </span><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/content-marketing-thought-leaders/2019/lee-odden-on-linkedins-place-in-the-bigger-marketing-picture"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophisticated Marketers interview with LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Millennial and Gen Z audiences expect brands to be honest and forthcoming. While some companies view information that is not a glowing endorsement of the brand as a liability, others are embracing those challenges as an opportunity to be transparent about issues and how they’re being solved. That transparency builds trust and confidence in the brand, key differentiators for customers who become loyal advocates.”</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lean on Case Studies and Testimonials.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Of course, positive and reinforcing examples of happy customers will be your strongest assets at this stage, so you’ll want to have plenty on hand — ideally, covering a variety of different challenges and scenarios, so you can match them up to the prospect in question for maximum resonance.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Frictionless Purchase Process. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">How easy is it for someone to make a purchase from your company? Take whatever steps you can to make it painless and simple, so that a person going through it never stops and wonders, “What’s going on here?” Test relentlessly and gather feedback from existing customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Retain: Follow-through and Service</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most prevalent missteps for brands and marketers is a failure to account for the post-sale customer experience. The attitude that once a sale is complete it’s time to move on is misguided. This is, in fact, perhaps your most critical moment to make a positive impact. Given that everyone is aware of the relative cost difference between selling to a repeat customer and acquiring a new one, it’s kind of crazy how few marketers prioritize this stage. Note that </span><a href="https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Listen-to-the-Voice-of-the-Customer-53239.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 68% of customer defections occur because customers perceive “an attitude of indifference.”</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Assist with Implementation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do you have at least one person on your staff who is solely dedicated to ensuring customers are able to implement and leverage your solution without issue? Can the customer easily get in touch with this person, and troubleshoot quickly? Although these activities don’t necessarily fall directly under the purview of marketing, there is a fair amount of overlap (social media, customer resources, integrations, etc.) and it’s an essential aspect of the customer experience so it’s important for marketers to have visibility and influence. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Create a Loyalty Loop.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This convention is at the center of our friend </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DrewDavisHere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Davis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s marketing philosophy. </span><a href="https://divvyhq.com/2018/10/tips-from-andrew-davis-on-leveling-up-content-with-the-loyalty-loop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he puts it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “You serve your audience and subscribers first,” rather than constantly emphasizing the importance of new eyeballs and new business. Basically, the Loyalty Loop is about taking advantage of that “moment of inspiration” right after someone commits to your brand, by delighting them and reinforcing the decision. The idea is that as a result, the next time they have a need, they won’t even consider your competition. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Offer Post-Purchase Content. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2017/11/how-content-retain-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart retention tactic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommended by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarciaRJohnston" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcia Riefer Johnston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a piece for Content Marketing Institute. Post-purchase content can include things like care and maintenance instructions, set-up guides, and repair help. This type of content can line up functionally with either, or both, of the bullets above.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Advocacy: Relationship Maintenance</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer advocates are incredibly valuable, but also exceedingly rare. These are the people who will autonomously recommend your brand to others, and sing your praises publicly without prompting. In some cases this will happen organically because they simply love your offering so dang much, but more often, you need to develop this deep brand affinity through ongoing engagement and relationship-building.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Stay in Touch.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Don’t just reach out because their renewal is coming up and you want them to buy from you again. Use a birthday, anniversary, or job change as a prompt to check in and say hello. Provide helpful content just for the sake of doing it. You should aspire to be an advocate for your customer if you want them to do the same.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Offer Customer Newsletters.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a great way to stay in touch at scale. Email marketing is generally viewed as a lead generation tactic but it’s also an excellent channel for increasing loyalty. Make sure the content in your newsletter for existing customers is purposeful and value-oriented.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Promote Customer Accomplishments. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary issue with most case studies is that they’re so focused on the solution, rather than the customer who used it. You’ll build more affinity by highlighting the user’s accomplishment — how they smartly handled a problem and got the most out of your product or service. Heck, you can even promote achievements by your customers that don’t involve your solution. Get the good vibes rolling.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put Trust First, and the Results Will Follow</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When companies are focused on sales and revenues and bottom lines, it becomes apparent in the way they operate. This is why the “sales funnel” or "marketing funnel" concept is one I find myself referencing less and less these days. The true end-goals of any savvy modern marketing strategy are to inspire loyalty, affinity, and advocacy. The trust funnel is built to do just that. As a natural result, the sales, revenue, and bottom-line impact will follow — consistently, and over the long haul.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust me on that.</span>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-26772 aligncenter" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/data-visualization.png" alt="Data Visualization for Marketing Presentations" width="600" height="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We’ve all been there. We’re five minutes into (what we thought would be) a riveting, data-driven presentation, yet a quick scan of the room reveals the audience is staring blankly at our data tables as we drone on. Or worse, someone asks a pointed question about what they do or don’t see and the discussion goes completely of course. Yikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Perhaps the best advice I ever received in this regard was so simple yet incredibly smart: “Try it as a line graph.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I had presented a data-backed presentation and robust recommended next steps, but whether it was boredom or data suspicion that crept in, I failed to make my case. After the weeks I spent looking at a spreadsheet, I took that visionary advice. When the day came to remake my case, that line graph immediately won my critics over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;When done thoughtfully, data visualizations have the power to change perspectives, far more quickly than a spreadsheet or bullet points on a slide. Data visualization allows us to take complex or even simple data sets, and present them in a way that allows us to see context, make comparisons, and enable decision-making. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The good news? Giving your data a visual identity is easier than you think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The Case for Data Visualization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This is going to sound cliché, but we marketers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;really&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; do have &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/11/optimize-with-data/"&gt;more data at our fingertips than ever before&lt;/a&gt;. And visualization is key in order for us to really leverage that data to tell a story and win over our bosses, colleagues, and customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Here’s a simple example. First, the spreadsheet version:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What can you take away from this example in just 5 seconds? 10 seconds? 30 seconds? July 2018 and December 2017 seemed to be big months. There was definitely some growth in the last two years. But how much? Is it consistent? How are we trending?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Now, let’s look at this data as a line graph:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-26767" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-Spreadsheet.png" alt="Data in a Spreadsheet" width="650" height="91" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Whoa! 2018 outperformed 2017 by quite a bit overall. However, 2017 traffic was on the up and up, and that momentum slowed in 2018. With the exception of a mid-year spike, 2018 traffic was flat, and dipped below year-over-year totals by the end of the year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26768" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-in-a-Line-Graph.png" alt="Data in a Line Graph" width="506" height="322" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The beauty here? As we prepare to deliver the data to our audience, we can draw some pretty important conclusions at a glance, helping us quickly arrive at what we need to find out next: What caused that big spike in July 2018? Is it an outlier or did we have an effective campaign running? What did the tactical mix look like throughout 2017? What were the top pages contributing to steady growth? Did we make major changes at the beginning of 2018?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This not only helps us dig deeper into our data to understand trends and opportunities, but also prepare us to craft a narrative and answer the questions our bosses, colleagues, or clients will undoubtedly have about performance. After all, flashing a spreadsheet and then telling someone traffic is up year-over-year overall but flat month-over-month for the current year is not going to deliver much wow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;How to Get the Storytelling Started with Data Visualization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Creating a narrative, choosing your data set, perfecting your visualization, and adding context are essential for being able to persuade any sort of action or reaction with data. But whether you are using a simple Excel graph or a custom data visualization tool, here are some great tips to get started. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tip #1 - Start with your story and frame it for your audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Let’s say you’re presenting the results of your most recent marketing campaign to your internal stakeholders. It can be tempting to throw up any data point you can get your hands on, trying to see what sticks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Don’t do that. Your boss probably doesn’t care about how many shares you got on that one blog post or how many seconds someone spent on a video. They care about new prospects, re-engaged prospects, or advocacy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay laser focused on your objective:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; What are you trying to achieve with this presentation? A bigger budget? A promotion? A shift in tactics internally? Every data visualization included should tell that story. Too many data points can muddy the narrative and reduce your impact. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use your audience’s lens:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Focus on the data you know is most important to your audience. Think of previous presentations you’ve done with them. Was there a particular data visualization they loved or one they pushed back on? Edit accordingly. If it’s your first time presenting to this audience, then use what you know based on job titles or culture in your office. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;One mistake it can be easy to make as marketers, is slipping into marketing lingo (e.g. sessions, shares, click-through-rate, bounce-rate). One simple shift if you’re presenting outside of your team, is shift your language to focus on meaningful business metrics. For example:  Instead of saying visitor, say potential prospect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tip #2 - Design for comprehension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data visualization is so awesome because it’s able to allow humans to quickly make comparisons and decisions quickly, even with a complex data set. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;So create charts with comprehension in mind. If your audience is staring at a graph trying to figure out what it means, they’re probably not listening to your supporting narrative. So make it easy for them to understand. Here are a few things to keep in mind: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Label Everything:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; This seems straight forward, but nothing is worse than when someone pauses you mid sentence to ask you to clarify your data set. So, label your chart, axes, legend, and so on. Also include a note on time frame and data source. Make sure all labels are visible and not obstructed by other text. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chart Type:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Choose the chart type that most efficiently illustrates your point:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Bar charts are best for comparing discrete values. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Line charts are intended for a continuous data set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Pie charts show the element something else is made up of, and are not ideal for comparing values.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Stacked bar charts are best to compare different items and show the composition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For example, while the pie chart allows us to see a breakdown of traffic sources, the placement of legend, the close color families, and a similar proportion of the individual pieces make it difficult for a true comparison. With the bar chart, however, you can easily see how the traffic sources stack up next to one another. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-26769" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-Pie-Chart.png" alt="" width="500" height="296" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-26770" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-in-Bar-Graph.png" alt="Data in Bar Graph" width="500" height="279" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Color: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Incorporating color to help tell your story can be very powerful, but can also lend confusion. A few practical things to consider: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Don’t choose colors that are low contrast. Consider the fact that you may be presenting on a different monitor and the audience will be further away from the screen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Use the same color to represent data from the same grouping or data set (e.g. all points from 2018 are in green and 2019 in yellow.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Be careful about using colors that have significant meaning on their own (e.g. bright red is always going to set off an alarm bell, whereas green tends to indicate something is good.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Use accent colors to highlight really key data points. This can draw your audience’s eye immediately and increase comprehension. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A couple final thoughts here: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add call-outs to your slides&lt;/strong&gt; so you can help your audience understand a data set really quickly (e.g. Sales reached an all time high in June 2019).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your data ordering intuitive&lt;/strong&gt; such as ordering by value, time period, or alphabetically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tip #3 - Create for context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We should always anticipate, any presentation we create, can and will be passed along for others to consume, without the benefit of our verbal narrative. So, it’s important that your data visualizations have enough context so the impact can be understood with or without verbal support. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What do we mean by context? Here are a few things to keep in mind:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is this good or bad? What would you expect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; This is definitely a frequently asked question from marketers as we are evaluating campaign or channel performance. One of the most important contextual markers you can add to a performance slide is a benchmark from previous data or third-party industry data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data visualization can help us understand the current situation, but they can also help us answer the “why” behind a data set. Context in this situation can reveal hidden insights, which can really change the minds of our audience. For example, let’s say you are charting MQLs over time, now plot that against another variables which may drive fluctuations in MQLs, like website traffic, paid investment or frequency of events. This might help you determine whether overall web traffic is irrelevant, but paid investments are critical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should we do next?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Now that we understand the context for our data and what is driving it, the next question is what should we do next? Always include next steps related to your data visualization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26771" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Side-by-Side-Bar-Graph.png" alt="Side by Side Bar Graph" width="481" height="289" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Finally, looking at the same data as in our previous visualizations. This example dives into July 2018, with the added context of 2017. In this graph, we can easily see a spike in social caused our July 2018 increase. Now, we can add a call out to shout out to testing a paid social campaign or a contest that was running at that time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tip #4: Be careful not to mislead your audience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data can be really powerful, if used wisely. But if we don’t understand or interpret it properly, it can also drive bad decision making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;So as a presenter, definitely do these things to keep your data representation free of misleading information:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start your key at zero (and keep it consistent):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; It can be tempting to make that 3% increase look like 50%, but don’t change your scale unless it’s really pertinent to the data set, and then call it out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understand your data:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; If you (or your team) is pulling data from a tool like Google Analytics or Hubspot, be sure you understand the nuance or context of your data points (e.g. what’s included in that site conversion rate, how you’re categorizing a new user, what is the criteria for SQL versus MQL.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Include context: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Be careful not to omit the context or drivers of the data set you’re aware of, even if they don't necessarily fit your narrative. For example, if you had a great Q3 for leads, but the first half of the year was down, don’t omit that context, just to make Q3 appear better. That context will probably change your tactical mix, investment levels, and next steps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Show Don’t Tell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To be really effective marketers, we must review and analyze data in order to make our own decisions about a tweak in tactics or a strategy overhaul. Our ability to illustrate to our colleagues, bosses, and customers how data insights inform our decisions ultimately impacts our ability to move forward with our plans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;So practice! Find that colleague who can review your latest graph and see what their first takeaway is. Do your presentation with a smaller group before you bring to your boss. See what they respond well to or question, and edit accordingly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data is power. Data visualization is powerful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all been there. We’re five minutes into (what we thought would be) a riveting, data-driven presentation, yet a quick scan of the room reveals the audience is staring blankly at our data tables as we drone on. Or worse, someone asks a pointed question about what they do or don’t see and the discussion goes completely of course. Yikes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the best advice I ever received in this regard was so simple yet incredibly smart: “Try it as a line graph.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had presented a data-backed presentation and robust recommended next steps, but whether it was boredom or data suspicion that crept in, I failed to make my case. After the weeks I spent looking at a spreadsheet, I took that visionary advice. When the day came to remake my case, that line graph immediately won my critics over.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When done thoughtfully, data visualizations have the power to change perspectives, far more quickly than a spreadsheet or bullet points on a slide. Data visualization allows us to take complex or even simple data sets, and present them in a way that allows us to see context, make comparisons, and enable decision-making. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news? Giving your data a visual identity is easier than you think.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Case for Data Visualization</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to sound cliché, but we marketers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do have <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/11/optimize-with-data/">more data at our fingertips than ever before</a>. And visualization is key in order for us to really leverage that data to tell a story and win over our bosses, colleagues, and customers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a simple example. First, the spreadsheet version:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What can you take away from this example in just 5 seconds? 10 seconds? 30 seconds? July 2018 and December 2017 seemed to be big months. There was definitely some growth in the last two years. But how much? Is it consistent? How are we trending?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s look at this data as a line graph:</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-26767" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-Spreadsheet.png" alt="Data in a Spreadsheet" width="650" height="91" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa! 2018 outperformed 2017 by quite a bit overall. However, 2017 traffic was on the up and up, and that momentum slowed in 2018. With the exception of a mid-year spike, 2018 traffic was flat, and dipped below year-over-year totals by the end of the year.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26768" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Data-in-a-Line-Graph.png" alt="Data in a Line Graph" width="506" height="322" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty here? As we prepare to deliver the data to our audience, we can draw some pretty important conclusions at a glance, helping us quickly arrive at what we need to find out next: What caused that big spike in July 2018? Is it an outlier or did we have an effective campaign running? What did the tactical mix look like throughout 2017? What were the top pages contributing to steady growth? Did we make major changes at the beginning of 2018?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This not only helps us dig deeper into our data to understand trends and opportunities, but also prepare us to craft a narrative and answer the questions our bosses, colleagues, or clients will undoubtedly have about performance. After all, flashing a spreadsheet and then telling someone traffic is up year-over-year overall but flat month-over-month for the current year is not going to deliver much wow.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Get the Storytelling Started with Data Visualization</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a narrative, choosing your data set, perfecting your visualization, and adding context are essential for being able to persuade any sort of action or reaction with data.

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Why? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data visualization can help us understand the current situation, but they can also help us answer the “why” behind a data set. Context in this situation can reveal hidden insights, which can really change the minds of our audience. For example, let’s say you are charting MQLs over time, now plot that against another variables which may drive fluctuations in MQLs, like website traffic, paid investment or frequency of events. This might help you determine whether overall web traffic is irrelevant, but paid investments are critical.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>What should we do next?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now that we understand the context for our data and what is driving it, the next question is what should we do next? Always include next steps related to your data visualization. </span></li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26771" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Side-by-Side-Bar-Graph.png" alt="Side by Side Bar Graph" width="481" height="289" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, looking at the same data as in our previous visualizations. This example dives into July 2018, with the added context of 2017. In this graph, we can easily see a spike in social caused our July 2018 increase. Now, we can add a call out to shout out to testing a paid social campaign or a contest that was running at that time. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip #4: Be careful not to mislead your audience.</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Data can be really powerful, if used wisely. But if we don’t understand or interpret it properly, it can also drive bad decision making.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So as a presenter, definitely do these things to keep your data representation free of misleading information:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start your key at zero (and keep it consistent):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It can be tempting to make that 3% increase look like 50%, but don’t change your scale unless it’s really pertinent to the data set, and then call it out. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Understand your data:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you (or your team) is pulling data from a tool like Google Analytics or Hubspot, be sure you understand the nuance or context of your data points (e.g. what’s included in that site conversion rate, how you’re categorizing a new user, what is the criteria for SQL versus MQL.)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Include context: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be careful not to omit the context or drivers of the data set you’re aware of, even if they don't necessarily fit your narrative. For example, if you had a great Q3 for leads, but the first half of the year was down, don’t omit that context, just to make Q3 appear better. That context will probably change your tactical mix, investment levels, and next steps. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show Don’t Tell</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To be really effective marketers, we must review and analyze data in order to make our own decisions about a tweak in tactics or a strategy overhaul. Our ability to illustrate to our colleagues, bosses, and customers how data insights inform our decisions ultimately impacts our ability to move forward with our plans. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So practice! Find that colleague who can review your latest graph and see what their first takeaway is. Do your presentation with a smaller group before you bring to your boss. See what they respond well to or question, and edit accordingly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is power. Data visualization is powerful.</span>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-26756 size-full" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-marketing-budget-planning.png" alt="" width="600" height="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The high-pressure marketing budget and strategy planning season seems to kick-off earlier each year. It’s as if your boss is asking you to magically construct the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;perfect &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;strategic and tactical mix at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; budget for 2020, without having enough of 2019 under your belt to predict the best approach. After all, you don’t know what the future holds, right? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As they say, hindsight is 20/20. So, why not leverage that to get some 20/20 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;foresight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Like you, we at TopRank Marketing don’t have any magical crystal balls or employees with psychic powers. We don’t use witchcraft to brew mystical marketing love potions. And we certainly don’t engage in any sorcery with enchanted mirrors, but we’ve honed our craft over nearly 20 years and we do find plenty of value in reflecting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Just a mystic or a wizard or an enchantress gathers their crystals, herbs, or sacred artifacts, you too have transcendent tools available to you. Read on to learn how you can cast your spell, summon your marketing spirit, or connect with marketing’s natural elements to create a strategic 2020 marketing plan—without relying on the supernatural.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Research: The Magic Ingredient for Concocting Any Marketing Strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As a marketer you don’t know what you don’t know. And, that’s okay. Clairvoyance is not part of the job description. Begin your brew with some thoughtful research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep up with the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/topic/whats-trending-in-marketing-top-content-of-the-week"&gt;&lt;b&gt;latest trends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Is there a new tactic or strategy you should be testing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/case-studies/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;case studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; from other B2B businesses. What’s working for them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re-research your audience. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Are your assumptions correct? What has changed since last year? What hasn’t? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Learn like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/modern-polymath-81f882ce52db"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;polymath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Bill Gates and the likes, by dedicating &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/the-founders-of-the-world-s-five-largest-companies-all-follow-the-5-hour-rule/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;5+ hours per week to learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Polymaths lead in their field by becoming competent in at least three diverse domains and integrating learnings into their current skill set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/dwG4LOsEDVOU0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/halloween-vintage-classic-dwG4LOsEDVOU0"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Now that you’re tuned up, use your knowledge to spark new ideas, strengthen your plan recommendations, and back up your recommendations with solid rationales.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Data: Unlocking Insight to Season Your Potion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Every wizard, witch, psychic, or gifted mystic has had to spend a great deal of time to unlock the power inside themselves, you too must devote time to understand one of your most powerful tools: data. Anyone can come up with a striking idea, but it takes a special marketer to use data and unlock the insights within. Try this approach to uncover what you need to know to inform your marketing plan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Gather the Data and Dive In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Leverage your tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to pull data from all of your tactics in the past year, including campaigns and ongoing programs.  You can also gather audience data and benchmarks from the research you’ve been doing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Don’t be afraid to spend a little time diving down rabbit-holes. At this annual reflection point, what better time t&lt;/span&gt;o dig into an unnoticed trend or insight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="Don’t be afraid to spend a little time diving down rabbit-holes. At this annual reflection point, what better time to dig into an unnoticed trend or insight? - @ElizabethW1057 on 2020 #MarketingStrategy" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Confirm Your Benchmarks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Look across your data to establish benchmarks fit to your brand that will be valuable in informing your decisions. Again, feel free to check out industry benchmarks, but remember your brand is a unique situation. For instance, are you a startup looking to create a demand for a new niche? Or are you an established enterprise looking to increase market share?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Unlock the Insights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Now it’s time to turn that data into something you can use. Look for trends, outliers, big successes and big failures. Each one can teach you something and guide your 2020 plan to be more strategic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Here’s a simple example of how you can go from data, to benchmark, to insight, to 2020 tactics:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In your latest campaign, you saw 2,652 sessions to your asset 90-days post-launch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Across your last 4 campaigns, you’ve averaged 2,002 sessions to your asset 90-days post-launch. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Nice! Your latest campaign drove 32% higher sessions. But why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You used email as an additional promotional tactic this time. And, email accounted for 27% of your total sessions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Let’s use email in all of our campaigns that target this audience, and explore a more robust, ongoing email program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;75% of your influencers amplified your asset, driving 22% of the total campaign traffic. But, did they have enough reach, with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; people, to make it worth it? Were there other benefits of including influencers? To understand the impact of your influencer work better, add researching new measurement techniques to your “to do” list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o72F4sCyzMghjapk4" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/outlander-season-2-starz-3o72F4sCyzMghjapk4"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Yes, there are many more metrics, variables, and considerations than simply number of visitors or a single promotional tactic, but you can leverage this approach to unlock some actionable insights from your data. Harness the positive vibes you uncover to inform your marketing plan, and bring your findings to the table to back up your recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Partners: Adding Natural Elements to Bind the Brew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Now, it’s time to combine elements for a comprehensive strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Stay Grounded: The Earth Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To enable your success, you must stay grounded. It can be easy to go heads down in planning after one quick conversation, but avoid the temptation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There is nothing worse than presenting a complete marketing plan to a room full of confused faces because you missed the core objective or are suggesting using a new tactic that just failed in another business unit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Chat with your budget stakeholders early and often about:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Are we aligned on the objective of my work in relation to the company’s business goals?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What are you looking for me to achieve in 2020?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Do you have any marketing strategies or tactics in mind that I should be considering? Or avoiding?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What does my 2020 budget look like?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Are you expecting any cuts? (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/07/prioritize-digital-marketing-after-budget-cuts/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Budget prioritization tips here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What have senior leadership or other BUs been talking about that I should be aware of?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="When you go into 2020 planning mode, stay grounded by circling the wagons with stakeholders early and often. @ElizabethW1057 #MarketingStrategy" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Seek Collaboration: The Water Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The water element governs relationships, and it changes shape based on whatever vessel contains it. Use the people around you to gather and mold your ideas this planning season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The information you gather from your internal teams can be an unmatched input for keyword research. It can also guide your influencer research, inform your tactical mix, or simply spark new ideas or ways of looking at problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your customer service team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; can tell you all the questions customers are asking about your product or service — what drives customers nuts and what they rave about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your sales team &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;will know every detail about what makes a customer want to buy versus what stands in the way of a sale. They also probably have competitive insights on the marketplace and know who influences their prospects. Just ask them!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your product team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; probably briefs with you ever so often, but have you talked to them lately? There might be a feature or benefit that you’ve yet to focus on, or not highlighted enough. With the insights you’ve gotten from customer service and sales, you’ll know just what to do with the product info.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Though often difficult to get in front of, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;your senior leadership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; will have invaluable insights into the company’s direction. Keep up on any content they’re publishing or sharing on social. And, when you get the opportunity to connect, be prepared with thoughtful questions and discussion points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Get Transformative: Fire Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Transformation, passion, and action are the domain of the fire element. Your marketing agency should embody this completely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Every &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2017/11/out-of-this-world-agency-partnership/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;fruitful client-agency partnership&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is rooted in a collaborative passion and drive for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;success. So, who better to ask for help on your 2020 marketing plan?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Your agency should have its finger on the pulse of the latest marketing strategies, tactics, and measurement techniques. And, it should be a consultative partner, giving you what you need to make the case for your 2020 budget. Tap your agency for anything from an informal brainstorm to proposing new ideas and tactics, and from campaign extension ideas to full collaboration on your entire plan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Seek Reflection: Wind Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The final element is wind or air. Air is sometimes a harsh element. It cuts away the nonsense and gets us right down to the facts. This is where your plan comes together and you begin to shine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Collect everything you’ve researched, studied and gathered, and reflect. Wipe away your emotions and what you feel like you should do. Give new ideas space to grow and be molded by your data and what you learned communing with your teams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Unleash Your Mystical Marketing Strategy Planning Abilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You started making your magic marketing potion with research, filled it to the top with data and sprinkled in all of the world’s natural elements. Now, the power is in your hands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You’re ready to concoct your 2020 marketing plan. Don’t hesitate to check back in with your team while you brew. Gather their feedback and refine, because collaboration is how the magic happens. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Would an agency partner be helpful for your 2020 planning? We’d love to help. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/contact/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get in touch today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The high-pressure marketing budget and strategy planning season seems to kick-off earlier each year. It’s as if your boss is asking you to magically construct the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfect </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic and tactical mix at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> budget for 2020, without having enough of 2019 under your belt to predict the best approach. After all, you don’t know what the future holds, right? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As they say, hindsight is 20/20. So, why not leverage that to get some 20/20 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">foresight</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like you, we at TopRank Marketing don’t have any magical crystal balls or employees with psychic powers. We don’t use witchcraft to brew mystical marketing love potions. And we certainly don’t engage in any sorcery with enchanted mirrors, but we’ve honed our craft over nearly 20 years and we do find plenty of value in reflecting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a mystic or a wizard or an enchantress gathers their crystals, herbs, or sacred artifacts, you too have transcendent tools available to you. Read on to learn how you can cast your spell, summon your marketing spirit, or connect with marketing’s natural elements to create a strategic 2020 marketing plan—without relying on the supernatural.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research: The Magic Ingredient for Concocting Any Marketing Strategy</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a marketer you don’t know what you don’t know. And, that’s okay. Clairvoyance is not part of the job description. Begin your brew with some thoughtful research.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Keep up with the </b><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/topic/whats-trending-in-marketing-top-content-of-the-week"><b>latest trends</b></a><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is there a new tactic or strategy you should be testing?</span></li>
 	<li><b>Read </b><a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/case-studies/"><b>case studies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from other B2B businesses. What’s working for them?</span></li>
 	<li><b>Re-research your audience. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are your assumptions correct? What has changed since last year? What hasn’t? </span></li>
 	<li><b>Bonus. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn like </span><a href="https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/modern-polymath-81f882ce52db"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polymath</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bill Gates and the likes, by dedicating </span><a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/the-founders-of-the-world-s-five-largest-companies-all-follow-the-5-hour-rule/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5+ hours per week to learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Polymaths lead in their field by becoming competent in at least three diverse domains and integrating learnings into their current skill set.</span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’re tuned up, use your knowledge to spark new ideas, strengthen your plan recommendations, and back up your recommendations with solid rationales.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data: Unlocking Insight to Season Your Potion</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every wizard, witch, psychic, or gifted mystic has had to spend a great deal of time to unlock the power inside themselves, you too must devote time to understand one of your most powerful tools: data. Anyone can come up with a striking idea, but it takes a special marketer to use data and unlock the insights within. Try this approach to uncover what you need to know to inform your marketing plan:</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather the Data and Dive In</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage your tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console to pull data from all of your tactics in the past year, including campaigns and ongoing programs.  You can also gather audience data and benchmarks from the research you’ve been doing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid to spend a little time diving down rabbit-holes. At this annual reflection point, what better time t</span>o dig into an unnoticed trend or insight?

[bctt tweet="Don’t be afraid to spend a little time diving down rabbit-holes. At this annual reflection point, what better time to dig into an unnoticed trend or insight? - @ElizabethW1057 on 2020 #MarketingStrategy" username="toprank"]
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confirm Your Benchmarks</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Look across your data to establish benchmarks fit to your brand that will be valuable in informing your decisions. Again, feel free to check out industry benchmarks, but remember your brand is a unique situation. For instance, are you a startup looking to create a demand for a new niche? Or are you an established enterprise looking to increase market share?</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlock the Insights</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s time to turn that data into something you can use. Look for trends, outliers, big successes and big failures. Each one can teach you something and guide your 2020 plan to be more strategic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a simple example of how you can go from data, to benchmark, to insight, to 2020 tactics:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In your latest campaign, you saw 2,652 sessions to your asset 90-days post-launch.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across your last 4 campaigns, you’ve averaged 2,002 sessions to your asset 90-days post-launch. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nice! Your latest campaign drove 32% higher sessions. But why?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You used email as an additional promotional tactic this time. And, email accounted for 27% of your total sessions.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s use email in all of our campaigns that target this audience, and explore a more robust, ongoing email program.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Bonus: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of your influencers amplified your asset, driving 22% of the total campaign traffic. But, did they have enough reach, with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people, to make it worth it? Were there other benefits of including influencers? To understand the impact of your influencer work better, add researching new measurement techniques to your “to do” list.</span></li>
</ol>
<iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o72F4sCyzMghjapk4" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/outlander-season-2-starz-3o72F4sCyzMghjapk4">via GIPHY</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there are many more metrics, variables, and considerations than simply number of visitors or a single promotional tactic, but you can leverage this approach to unlock some actionable insights from your data. Harness the positive vibes you uncover to inform your marketing plan, and bring your findings to the table to back up your recommendations.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners: Adding Natural Elements to Bind the Brew</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it’s time to combine elements for a comprehensive strategy.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay Grounded: The Earth Element</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To enable your success, you must stay grounded. It can be easy to go heads down in planning after one quick conversation, but avoid the temptation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing worse than presenting a complete marketing plan to a room full of confused faces because you missed the core objective or are suggesting using a new tactic that just failed in another business unit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat with your budget stakeholders early and often about:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we aligned on the objective of my work in relation to the company’s business goals?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you looking for me to achieve in 2020?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have any marketing strategies or tactics in mind that I should be considering? Or avoiding?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does my 2020 budget look like?</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you expecting any cuts? (</span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/07/prioritize-digital-marketing-after-budget-cuts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget prioritization tips here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What have senior leadership or other BUs been talking about that I should be aware of?</span></li>
</ul>
[bctt tweet="When you go into 2020 planning mode, stay grounded by circling the wagons with stakeholders early and often. @ElizabethW1057 #MarketingStrategy" username="toprank"]
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seek Collaboration: The Water Element</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The water element governs relationships, and it changes shape based on whatever vessel contains it. Use the people around you to gather and mold your ideas this planning season. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The information you gather from your internal teams can be an unmatched input for keyword research. It can also guide your influencer research, inform your tactical mix, or simply spark new ideas or ways of looking at problems.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Your customer service team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can tell you all the questions customers are asking about your product or service — what drives customers nuts and what they rave about.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Your sales team </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">will know every detail about what makes a customer want to buy versus what stands in the way of a sale. They also probably have competitive insights on the marketplace and know who influences their prospects. Just ask them!</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Your product team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> probably briefs with you ever so often, but have you talked to them lately? There might be a feature or benefit that you’ve yet to focus on, or not highlighted enough. With the insights you’ve gotten from customer service and sales, you’ll know just what to do with the product info.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though often difficult to get in front of, </span><b>your senior leadership</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will have invaluable insights into the company’s direction. Keep up on any content they’re publishing or sharing on social. And, when you get the opportunity to connect, be prepared with thoughtful questions and discussion points.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Transformative: Fire Element</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Transformation, passion, and action are the domain of the fire element. Your marketing agency should embody this completely. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2017/11/out-of-this-world-agency-partnership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fruitful client-agency partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is rooted in a collaborative passion and drive for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">success. So, who better to ask for help on your 2020 marketing plan?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your agency should have its finger on the pulse of the latest marketing strategies, tactics, and measurement techniques. And, it should be a consultative partner, giving you what you need to make the case for your 2020 budget. Tap your agency for anything from an informal brainstorm to proposing new ideas and tactics, and from campaign extension ideas to full collaboration on your entire plan. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seek Reflection: Wind Element</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The final element is wind or air. Air is sometimes a harsh element. It cuts away the nonsense and gets us right down to the facts. This is where your plan comes together and you begin to shine. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect everything you’ve researched, studied and gathered, and reflect. Wipe away your emotions and what you feel like you should do. Give new ideas space to grow and be molded by your data and what you learned communing with your teams. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unleash Your Mystical Marketing Strategy Planning Abilities</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You started making your magic marketing potion with research, filled it to the top with data and sprinkled in all of the world’s natural elements. Now, the power is in your hands. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re ready to concoct your 2020 marketing plan. Don’t hesitate to check back in with your team while you brew. Gather their feedback and refine, because collaboration is how the magic happens. </span>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26745" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019TopRankMarketingMarathonMarketing600w.jpg" alt="Collage of six images of marathon runners." width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing a marathon and running a successful marketing campaign have a surprising number of similarities — in fact, here are &lt;strong&gt;26.2 things they share in common&lt;/strong&gt;, and the lessons they can teach us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running marathons since 1998 and working in digital communications and marketing since 1984 — two pursuits I’m passionate about that may initially seem quite dissimilar, but which really do have much in common when you begin to look closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of Pre-Race Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marathon isn’t a race you want to run with no training or on a whim — and even if you did, the notoriously unforgiving distance has a way of giving runners back just what they put into it. Skimping on training usually spells disaster when it comes to marathon running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, successful marketing is usually the result of putting in the necessary planning the way runners pack in the marathon training miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin our 26.2 mile marketing marathon with our first steps and lesson number one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 1’s Lesson: Have a Great Training Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonA600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners along canal image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26747" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time-tested training plan is a vital part of preparing for a marathon — whether it’s one of the popular multi-week plans from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/higdonmarathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Hal Higdon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Pfitzinger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Pete Pfitzinger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Jack_Daniels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;J. Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, or a custom variation you’ve tailored to your own style of running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly in marketing, &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/09/boost-content-marketing-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;a proper and well thought-out plan&lt;/a&gt; is important when it comes to tackling any new campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good training plan in both running and marketing will help you get the most of our your race or campaign, starting out by &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/04/social-media-marketing-benchmarks-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;setting benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; and goals to hit along the way as you build up to the big race or campaign launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In marathon running it’s often said there’s no substitute for getting in the miles, and with marketing too there’s no magical elixir or great secret about what needs to go into a top-caliber campaign, so it’s a matter of finding what works and making a concerted effort at every step of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A marathon training plan will usually cover the period of between eight and 16 weeks before your target race, and by analyzing how you handle the daily prescribed workouts, you’ll be able to gauge how prepared you are when race day comes around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“If the marathon if a part-time interest, you will only get part-time results.” — Bill Rodgers @BillRodgersRACE " username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In marketing, how detailed and dedicated you are in following the planning process will have a direct effect on what happens on the day of the big campaign launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The runners and coaches who’ve devised top marathon training plans are similar to the marketing industry pioneers, &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/03/social-media-influencers-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;experts and influencers&lt;/a&gt; who we can look to for guidance when mapping out a big new B2B marketing initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both marathon training and marketing planning benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/b2b-influencer-relationship-characteristics/"&gt;relationship building&lt;/a&gt;, as runners will want to forge relationships with other runners using the same training plan, or sometimes even the author of the plan themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, marketers will want to interact and learn from as many of the experts as possible who have devoted their careers to the powerful marketing methods that go into creating a successful pre-launch campaign plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“If you want your content to be great, ask influencers to participate.” — Lee Odden @LeeOdden" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience and credibility of the people you learn from and follow during both marathon training and marketing planning has a direct impact on how your training and campaigns will perform, so it’s important for runners to build relationships with people who have had marathon success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For B2B marketers, it’s ideal to work with and learn from those who have planned and executed &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/03/most-woke-b2b-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;highly-successful and award-winning campaigns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You’ve passed one of the biggest obstacles of running a marathon or creating a great marketing effort — getting started with those first steps. Let’s move on to another lesson as we reach mile two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 2’s Lesson: Know Your Running &amp;amp; Marketing Training Paces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon training plans spell out the workouts that will best help prepare you for race day, with some days set aside for long runs, some for mid-speed tempo workouts, and others for faster interval repetition sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful marketing plans also focus on specific aspects of bringing a campaign to the starting line, with preparations including the long-run equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/ingredients-content-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;creating strong content or digital assets&lt;/a&gt;, a tempo-like initiative of &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/how-select-b2b-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;finding and working with the right industry experts&lt;/a&gt;, and an interval-like burst of effort to plan for both organic and paid promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="It’s easy to get excited about a big name or an influencer with a large following, but neither of those will necessarily translate to your ultimate goal of delivering results to your organization. @martinjonesaz" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done! You’re already approaching mile three and a new running and marketing lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 3’s Lesson: Warm Up Before Running or Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonB600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26748" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially at the top level of marathon running, a carefully planned pre-race warm-up is an important part of training, and chronologically the last piece of the puzzle before the starting gun goes off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elite marathoners work hard to keep their body at an optimal temperature up to the last possible moment, and during the 15 minutes before race time you’ll find them running their warm-up routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For top marketing performance, before a campaign begins it’s not the physical warm-up routine that will help during an imminent launch, but the psychological boost that comes from having reviewed all of the planning you and your team have done, and ensuring that you’re in the most positive state of mind when launch time arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Right Race Equipment &amp;amp; Marketing Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers and runners both need equipment to have the best performance possible, so let’s take a look at some of the lessons we can learn from our running and marketing equipment, as we move along to mile four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 4’s Lesson: The Shoe Hits the Pavement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 99.9 percent of marathon runners — unless you’re &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijk72IL6BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Abebe Bikila&lt;/a&gt; who won gold sans shoes at the 1960 Olympics — wearing the right shoes will be an important part of your training and racing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time to learn which shoe works best for your feet is during training, keeping in mind that you should never allow yourself to make the rookie mistake of wearing brand new shoes on race day, even if they’re the same model you’ve used in your marathon build-up. Slight construction variations in shoes, along with wear patterns specific to your foot strike, mean that you should always race in a shoe you’ve trained in for at least a week or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing tactics you’ll use in your campaigns represent similar important choices, and you won’t want to be trying unplanned and untested methods once your big campaign has launched — the time to test them is during your pre-launch planning phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test your marketing tools and services on example campaigns, and use your team to uncover any shortcomings in the lead-up to launch, rather than in the days after your effort has gone live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s that ahead — can it be the five mile marker already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 5’s Lesson: Wear Comfortable Shorts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonC600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners on bridge image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26749" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the perfect running shorts for your marathon is another seemingly insignificant equipment choice that can have a surprising impact on the outcome of your race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorts that have too many seams or other uncomfortable construction methods are likely to make you more and more uncomfortable as the miles go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with shoes, the time to try out different shorts is in the weeks and months before your race, so resist the temptation to race in those flashy new shorts you just got at the marathon expo the day before the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers too need to find the methods that work best for them over the long haul of a modern digital marketing campaign — one that is likely to last substantially longer than even an ultra-marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to find and use the marketing solutions that augment and work alongside your strengths, and hold off on those that just aren’t in-line with the way you and your team work, or your desired campaign goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 6’s Lesson: Use Tried &amp;amp; True Socks &amp;amp; Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that something like the choice of which socks to wear — or whether to wear any at all — during a marathon is insignificant, however&lt;strong&gt; in distance running as well as in marketing, even the smallest details can over time and miles add up to being either great assets, or debilitating troubles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race in socks you know well from training, with the right amount of padding, wicking abilities, and other performance features for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly with marketing, don’t neglect the small details with campaign components such as proof-reading, testing, private trial runs to gather feedback, and other aspects of &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/content-marketing-project-management-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;strong project management&lt;/a&gt; that your competitors may be skipping over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 7’s Lesson: Wear a Race-Worthy Singlet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shirt or singlet you race your marathon in should be comfortable, with a minimal number of potentially abrasion-causing seams, made from modern wicking materials, and since it’s such a visible part of your race-day gear, you may want to choose one that speaks to your own personal fashion style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elite marathoners are usually required to wear the singlet featuring their sponsors’ logos, but at all other levels you’ll have great freedom to choose in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some runners use an easy trick to give themselves a small but powerful edge during the marathon: simply use a permanent marker to &lt;strong&gt;write your name on the front of your singlet&lt;/strong&gt;. I did this one year running Grandma’s Marathon in my hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, and I got more encouragement from supporters lined up to watch the race than I’d had in all my previous marathons combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In marketing, how you package your campaign is similar to the choice of which singlet to wear. Certain B2B campaigns will require you to use very specific sponsorship images and messaging, while other campaigns will allow you to have nearly free reign over how your efforts will look when entering the digital world, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/social-media-video-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;social media video and messaging&lt;/a&gt;, paid search advertising, or the new audio branding possible with &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/promote-b2b-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;podcast marketing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 8’s Lesson: Utilize Timing Chip &amp;amp; Marketing Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started running marathons in 1998, the ones I ran hadn’t yet adopted timing chip technology, where a small plastic clip containing an RFID chip is attached to a shoe, but not long after that nearly every marathon was using them, making it easy to record official times at checkpoints along the marathon course, and also helping family and friends wanting to track a racer’s progress during the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many marketing campaigns, making it easy for customers and fans to share your digital asset and messages is also important — whether it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.contentmarketingworld.com/greatest-show/index.html?utm_source=CTT&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CMWorld2019Interactive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;full-blown interactive big top experience like the one we recently launched for Content Marketing World&lt;/a&gt; — or a more traditional blog article or infographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well done, marketers — the nine-mile marker is already in sight ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 9’s Lesson: Energize Along the Way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueling before, during, and after a marathon is an important piece of the racing puzzle, and also one you’ll want to work out and master before race day comes around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart marathoners know which variety of energy gel or bars will be available at the aid stations along the course, and will either learn to run fueled by them during training, bring along their own favorite racing energy food sources, or have family and friends positioned on the course to have them ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A savvy marketing effort will also benefit from having pre-planned boosts of digital energy to invigorate and re-fuel a campaign as it progresses, which can come in the form of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily or weekly social media promotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/content-gold-mines-conferences/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Special events&lt;/a&gt; rolled out to coincide with your campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contests and &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/07/power-social-media-polls/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;polls&lt;/a&gt; that are scheduled throughout your efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be mile ten already? Why yes, there it is now, along with another marketing lesson from marathon running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 10’s Lesson: Get a Phone or Watch Advantage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonD600w.jpg" alt="Runners touching colorful shoes together image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26750" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran my first marathon using a GPS training device in 2003, when I set my then state-of-the-art Garmin Forerunner 201 to help keep me on pace for my goal time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its tiny low-resolution black-and-white screen showed a rudimentary stick figure and noted whether you were ahead or behind goal pace. That day I saw only one other person wearing a GPS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today however, it’s hard to find a marathoner who isn’t using one — whether it’s a sport-specific watch or pod, or a cellphone in an armband using a dedicated running app such as iSmoothRun, my personal favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, successful digital marketers are always adopting new technologies to improve their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“The most successful digital marketers are always adopting new technologies to improve their efforts.” — Lane R. Ellis @lanerellis" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tools are built to help keep your campaign efforts on pace to reach your goals, just as in marathon running, while others are focused on planning or post-campaign data mining and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right marketing tools in an ever-expanding sea of choices can be daunting, however we’ve done plenty of research and in the following articles dig in to some of the most powerful utilities available for B2B marketers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 11’s Lesson: Don’t Forget Your Hat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good hat is another piece of marathon running equipment you’ll likely want to have on race day, if not to keep out the sun, at least to soak up the sweat a race-effort marathon will produce on all but the chilliest days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another seemingly minor decision, hats have been known to play a factor in the outcome of a marathon. During the 2016 U.S. Olympic Marathon trials, famed runner and now top coach Alberto Salazar went to a level of preparation not previously seen, when on an exceedingly hot race day he provided his runner Galen Rupp with new dry icy cool hats at various points along the course. Rupp went on to win the race, and ultimately earned a medal at that year’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“In today’s fiercely-competitive marketing world, a fanatical attention to the minute details can be all that separates a Cannes award-winning campaign from one relegated to the digital dustbin of marketing history.” @lanerellis" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 12’s Lesson: Marketing So Bright You’ll Need Sunglasses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunglasses can of course help runners block out sun, but they can also help inspire and provide motivation, through the use of the many varieties of colorful lenses available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years I reserved a special pair of sunglasses with yellow-tinted lenses for marathon day, and knew that when I was seeing the world through them that it was time to focus all my hard training on the immediate task ahead: hitting my mile splits, one at a time, through to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In marketing, we may not have special sunglasses, but when campaign roll-out day comes, we can utilize a wide variety of special means of encouragement to help us focus on our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some this may be waking earlier than normal, doing extra exercise, eating in an especially healthy manner, or simply using music that energizes and encourages you to do your best work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 13’s Lesson: Your Unique Identification Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each marathon’s pre-race package you’ll find a number bib to pin to your singlet — a unique identifying number for race officials and spectators alike to track and chart your progress during the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a number bib a racer would be what’s known as a race bandit -- someone who’s jumped in the race without paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing campaigns also have their own unique names and numbers, whether it’s an internal company code name, an official campaign effort name, or one of the identification numbers used by the various tools we use to track campaign performance against goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re the top-seeded racer wearing the #1 from winning the previous year or #22839, it’s your job in both running and marketing to &lt;strong&gt;make the most of what you have from the position you’re starting in&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing efforts can cause formerly small clients to achieve skyrocketing success when done very well, and for marathon runners one of the great unifying aspects is that everyone starts running at the same time and, theoretically, even someone at the back of the pack could win. There have even been cases where elite marathoners have shown up late to a race and gone on to catch up to the leaders after passing thousands of runners, something also sometimes possible in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Your Mark — Get Set — Go!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/4Tm3M5V6LoK9aKAOLK" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/LondonMarathon-london-marathon-4Tm3M5V6LoK9aKAOLK"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your training, planning, and equipment lined up and in order, let’s move on to strategy for actually hitting the starting line in both marathon running and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 14’s Lesson: Starting Line’s Launch Day!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it! The months and seemingly endless miles of training are complete. Every pre-race ritual has been attended to, and you’re completely prepared to run the best marathon you can for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the starting line is a place to focus on the difficult task ahead, don’t forget to at least give some acknowledgement to all the effort you’ve made to reach this point, and to think of all those who have helped you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy and excitement at the starting line of a marathon, whether large or small, is one of the most amazing experiences in all of running, and smart runners won’t block it out entirely, but learn to feed on and draw energy from these magic moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch day for marketers is similar, as a time to focus intently on the efforts ahead, to recall the expert planning you’ve done to give your campaign the best chance of digital success, and to think of and thank the people who have helped you reach launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 15’s Lesson: Keep To Your Plan &amp;amp; Don’t Zoom Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going out too fast is one of the most common mistakes new marathon runners make on race day, as the pre-race excitement and pent-up emotions all let loose when the starting gun goes off, and hundreds of runners all around you dart speedily onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that most runners will start too fast, smart runners hold back and work hard to stick to their predetermined mile-by-mile pacing plan, whether it’s through using the virtual training partner on your phone or smart watch, sticking to a pacing group, or simply by starting out running at a pace that feels too slow compared to those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“Motivation remains key to the marathon: the motivation to begin; the motivation to continue; the motivation never to quit.” Hal Higdon @higdonmarathon " username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most marathons have runners line up in sections corresponding to their goal finishing time, with elite runners on the actual starting line, and others positioned at spots set aside for those expecting to finish in three, four, five or more hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B2B marketers can also learn pacing lessons from marathon runners, as during campaign launches it’s important to not unleash more than you have allotted for launch day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 16’s Lesson: Hydrate &amp;amp; Nurture Your Body &amp;amp; Campaign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the marathon progresses, smart runners will know exactly where every water and sports drink aid station is, from studying official pre-race information, and they’ll follow the plan they’ve carefully laid out and used on long runs in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to best hydrate your body with water and sports drinks, and how to keep it cool using the sponges and shower misters on hand at many marathons, are also areas savvy runners will have learned and perfected in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As marketers we need to hydrate our campaigns too, by doing everything possible to keep our careful plans on track, with the skill to make quick adjustments on-the-fly as needed. Keeping up on the latest industry trends can help keep your marketing skills nimble, and here are three recent article we've published to help in that regard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 17’s Lesson: Utilize Aid Stations &amp;amp; Social Platforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonE600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners racing image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26751" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than just tables to grab water from, marathon aid stations represent the important passage of miles along the course — just like the official mile markers — often festooned with colorful and fun markings such as balloons or even particular themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many marathons have aid stations that are run by various non-profit or corporate organizations, each with their own unique style and flair, sometimes including radio stations with live bands. There are also usually many unofficial aid stations along big marathon courses, with supporters offering runners everything from strawberries and candy to beer and tequila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In marketing, the social media platforms your campaign will nearly always use also each have their own unique rules, features, and strengths, and it’s up to you as a smart marketer to know how to get the most from each one in the grand scheme of your marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re explored some of the best ways to achieve success using the top social platforms in the following recent articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 18’s Lesson: Get a Boost From Your Fellow Racers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the most focused marathon runner will see and interact with fellow racers during the hours spent running, and these runners can provide valuable inspiration during the race if you leave yourself open to the connecting moments each race brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember running a marathon where a runner dressed in a full official U.S. Postal Service mail carrier outfit passed me mid-race, complete with a letter bag and black leather shoes. He drew cheers from the crowds and fellow runners alike, and ended up setting a fastest-known-time record for a marathon run in a full postal outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other years there have been people running marathons carrying full-size flags, and there always seen to be runners who race in costumes, such as Elvis impersonators or dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“Everything you ever wanted to know about yourself you can learn in 26.2 miles.” — Lori Culnane " username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difficult aspect of marathon running to prepare for includes the inevitable runners you’ll encounter who are having a much worse day than you hopefully are — balled up in agony on the side of the road as severe cramps make them cry and moan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these runners is a humbling experience, as each one was previously out there faster than you until the wheels fell off or they became sick or injured. Taking lessons from them can help you appreciate that fact that you are still moving ahead, even if you may not be precisely on your goal pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’ll even pass one or two elite runners who have for whatever reason been slowed to a walk or jog, and this too can serve to help you &lt;strong&gt;reflect on the small victories you’ve had&lt;/strong&gt; within the marathon itself — a lesson that also applies to marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some marathon runners thrive on camaraderie during training and while racing, while others prefer to train and run alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As marketers, we can &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/online-offline-b2b-influencer-marketing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;universally benefit from relationship building&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s through using &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/linkedin-b2b-experts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;industry experts&lt;/a&gt; in a campaign, or the interaction with new clients brought about by smart and well-planned marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 19’s Lesson: Renew with Your Cheering Section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/26hit0GF1ZmM0WmD6" width="480" height="357" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/snl-saturday-night-live-1990s-26hit0GF1ZmM0WmD6"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having your own family and friends along the marathon course or at the finish will undoubtedly provide helpful cheering and encouragement during the race, so if you’re lucky enough to have them, take the time to thank them for coming out and supporting you on race day — if not during the race itself, once you’ve finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This holds true for marketers too of course, as the influencers, fans, clients, mentors and associates who’ve helped you and your campaign to succeed should also all be thanked, either in public, in private, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 20’s Lesson: Prepare For &amp;amp; Overcome Rough Patches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In running, hitting a rough patch is often called &lt;i&gt;bonking&lt;/i&gt;, and in marathoning this can often happen around mile 20, especially with new marathon runners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“No marathon gets easier later. The half way point only marks the end of the beginning.” — Joe Henderson" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to have alternate plans and time goals in place, and the flexibility to adjust your desired outcome depending on how badly you may be bonking, or worse yet, dealing with an in-race injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On race day, smart runners will also adjust their pacing and finish goals when Mother Nature throws difficult weather conditions into the mix. A rainy, especially hot and humid, or particularly cold day will see experienced marathoners adjusting their goals to meet the conditions at hand — a task experienced B2B marketers will also perform when unexpected elements out of their control strike a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a &lt;i&gt;plan b &lt;/i&gt;or&lt;i&gt; plan c&lt;/i&gt; are parts of planning that will help should the need ever arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 21’s Lesson: Precisely Monitor Time &amp;amp; Campaign Splits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonF600w.jpg" alt="Runners image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26752" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout your race, and especially as you near the final 10K of a marathon, keeping track of the time splits you reach for each mile — which will show how far ahead or behind your time goal you are running — is an important task, and one that gets progressively difficult as your energy levels fall during the later stages of a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before smart devices and phones, I used a pen to write my goal time splits on my palms. Later, running companies began offering wristbands with goal mile splits for various finish times from around a 2:45 marathon up to 5:30 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it’s easier than ever to track your mile splits during a marathon, so there’s little excuse for not knowing whether you need to try picking up the pace, or dialing it down a notch in order not to burn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As smart marketers we also note and celebrate important milestones during campaigns, and use tools to measure progress throughout the life-cycle of our marketing efforts, whether it’s audience engagement, reach, or other performance benchmarks. Here are several recent articles we've put together to help you with these important marketing tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 22’s Lesson: Work with Groups and Influencers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many larger marathons offer pacing groups to help runners reach specific time goals. The folks behind the CLIF bar helped pioneer marathon pacing groups, and for several marathons I ran alongside one of their excellent pacers — runners usually carrying a sign showing the pace group’s goal time, and sometimes also flags or balloons. Although their particular team is no longer in operation, others have taken up the slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s reassuring to be able to stick with your pacing group as planned, and equally frustrating to watch them fade into the distance ahead of you if you’re having a bad day on the marathon course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As marketers we use &lt;strong&gt;influencers, industry experts, clients, customers, and sometimes fans&lt;/strong&gt; to help us keep important campaigns on pace for hitting performance goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 23’s Lesson: Marathon Mind-Tricks &amp;amp; Marketing Mantras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/WKpDdC94PKtJC" width="480" height="347" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-sci-fi-star-wars-WKpDdC94PKtJC"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the many hours spent running while training for a marathon, some runners develop subtle psychological practices to help them get through difficult patches. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking of (or actually listening to, if you’re in a marathon that allows headphones…) an inspiring song&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeating a personally-inspirational mantra, saying, or phrase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making note of an upcoming tree or signpost and focusing only on making it that far, and then repeating the process again and again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers too can benefit from focusing, keeping a positive attitude, and mindfully working to build up and keep the energy needed when launching and running a modern digital marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“If you feel bad at 10 miles, you're in trouble. If you feel bad at 20 miles, you're normal. If you don't feel bad at 26 miles, you're abnormal.” @deek207 " username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 24’s Lesson: Track Those Marathon &amp;amp; Marketing KPIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every marathon and marketing campaign will have certain very important key performance indicators (KPIs). For the marathon, these usually come at the 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and 20-mile marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making your time split goals at these mileposts can be especially important in a runner’s mental efforts to stay on-track with reaching an overall race time finishing goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly in marketing, &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/actionable-content-marketing-dashboard/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;hitting important KPI levels&lt;/a&gt; at various predetermined points along the campaign journey is especially important when it comes to reaching our overall goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finish Line Fulfillment — Not the End But A New Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve come a long way now, and the end is nearing, so let’s take a look at how to get the very last drop of performance from your marathon and marketing efforts, and savor the hard-earned moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you believe that mile 25 is just up ahead now?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 25’s Lesson: Finish Line Celebrations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/d2zUIKkRfLelQBE1zx" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/LondonMarathon-london-marathon-d2zUIKkRfLelQBE1zx"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing like the first glimpse of the finish line in a marathon, as it seems to induce your body’s final, hidden stores of energy to release — a boost that only seems to come out when the body knows its work will soon thankfully be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a runner is ever going to feel a euphoric sense of elation, it’s most likely going to come while approaching the finish line of a marathon, knowing that nothing is going to stop you from crossing that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“If you want to run, run a mile. If you want to experience a different life, run a marathon.” — Emil Zatopek " username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great time to savor the moment and celebrate the weeks or months of hard training and planning, and the same can be said for the end of a successful marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mile 26’s Lesson: Take Time To Recover &amp;amp; Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the many strong emotions of the finish line, whether they’re for celebrating a goal that’s been met, or disappointment in falling short despite your best efforts, the time will come when you can learn a great deal by examining in detail how your race went — what worked well and what failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some runners like to write down their memories from a marathon as soon as possible after the race finishes, and marketers too can benefit from taking a look back once the campaign ends at what worked and what didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having this first-hand analysis of our performance can be invaluable when the time comes to launch the next similar marketing initiative, or to run another marathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mile 26.2’s Lesson: Go The Final Distance &amp;amp; Win Awards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hard work and fanatical training, a successful marathon may involve setting a new personal record, winning an age-group award, or at the highest level even winning an overall race medal outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In marketing, a great campaign can continue on long after it’s officially concluded, by providing a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/05/how-to-make-repurposed-content-cobbler/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;opportunities for derivative works through re-purposing&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/5-innovative-b2b-examples/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;entering and winning various industry awards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running marathons can help elevate our lives, enhance fitness, and bring newfound depth to each day, and great marketing can do the same as we &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/content-marketing-fitness/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;boost our marketing fitness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Racing a marathon and running a successful marketing campaign have a surprising number of similarities — in fact, here are <strong>26.2 things they share in common</strong>, and the lessons they can teach us.

I’ve been running marathons since 1998 and working in digital communications and marketing since 1984 — two pursuits I’m passionate about that may initially seem quite dissimilar, but which really do have much in common when you begin to look closely.
<h2>The Importance of Pre-Race Planning</h2>
The marathon isn’t a race you want to run with no training or on a whim — and even if you did, the notoriously unforgiving distance has a way of giving runners back just what they put into it. Skimping on training usually spells disaster when it comes to marathon running.

Similarly, successful marketing is usually the result of putting in the necessary planning the way runners pack in the marathon training miles.

Let’s begin our 26.2 mile marketing marathon with our first steps and lesson number one.
<h2>Mile 1’s Lesson: Have a Great Training Plan</h2>

<img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonA600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners along canal image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26747" />

A time-tested training plan is a vital part of preparing for a marathon — whether it’s one of the popular multi-week plans from <a href="https://twitter.com/higdonmarathon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hal Higdon</a>, <a href="https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Pfitzinger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Pfitzinger</a>, <a href="https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Jack_Daniels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J. Daniels</a>, or a custom variation you’ve tailored to your own style of running.

Similarly in marketing, <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/09/boost-content-marketing-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a proper and well thought-out plan</a> is important when it comes to tackling any new campaign.

A good training plan in both running and marketing will help you get the most of our your race or campaign, starting out by <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/04/social-media-marketing-benchmarks-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">setting benchmarks</a> and goals to hit along the way as you build up to the big race or campaign launch.

In marathon running it’s often said there’s no substitute for getting in the miles, and with marketing too there’s no magical elixir or great secret about what needs to go into a top-caliber campaign, so it’s a matter of finding what works and making a concerted effort at every step of the journey.

A marathon training plan will usually cover the period of between eight and 16 weeks before your target race, and by analyzing how you handle the daily prescribed workouts, you’ll be able to gauge how prepared you are when race day comes around.

[bctt tweet="“If the marathon if a part-time interest, you will only get part-time results.” — Bill Rodgers @BillRodgersRACE " username="toprank"]

In marketing, how detailed and dedicated you are in following the planning process will have a direct effect on what happens on the day of the big campaign launch.

The runners and coaches who’ve devised top marathon training plans are similar to the marketing industry pioneers, <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/03/social-media-influencers-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experts and influencers</a> who we can look to for guidance when mapping out a big new B2B marketing initiative.

Both marathon training and marketing planning benefit from <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/b2b-influencer-relationship-characteristics/">relationship building</a>, as runners will want to forge relationships with other runners using the same training plan, or sometimes even the author of the plan themselves.

Similarly, marketers will want to interact and learn from as many of the experts as possible who have devoted their careers to the powerful marketing methods that go into creating a successful pre-launch campaign plan.

[bctt tweet="“If you want your content to be great, ask influencers to participate.” — Lee Odden @LeeOdden" username="toprank"]

The experience and credibility of the people you learn from and follow during both marathon training and marketing planning has a direct impact on how your training and campaigns will perform, so it’s important for runners to build relationships with people who have had marathon success.

For B2B marketers, it’s ideal to work with and learn from those who have planned and executed <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/03/most-woke-b2b-marketers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly-successful and award-winning campaigns</a>.

Congratulations! You’ve passed one of the biggest obstacles of running a marathon or creating a great marketing effort — getting started with those first steps. Let’s move on to another lesson as we reach mile two.
<h2>Mile 2’s Lesson: Know Your Running &amp; Marketing Training Paces</h2>
Marathon training plans spell out the workouts that will best help prepare you for race day, with some days set aside for long runs, some for mid-speed tempo workouts, and others for faster interval repetition sessions.

Successful marketing plans also focus on specific aspects of bringing a campaign to the starting line, with preparations including the long-run equivalent of <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/ingredients-content-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating strong content or digital assets</a>, a tempo-like initiative of <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/how-select-b2b-influencers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finding and working with the right industry experts</a>, and an interval-like burst of effort to plan for both organic and paid promotion.

[bctt tweet="It’s easy to get excited about a big name or an influencer with a large following, but neither of those will necessarily translate to your ultimate goal of delivering results to your organization. @martinjonesaz" username="toprank"]

Well done! You’re already approaching mile three and a new running and marketing lesson.
<h2>Mile 3’s Lesson: Warm Up Before Running or Marketing</h2>

<img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonB600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26748" />

Especially at the top level of marathon running, a carefully planned pre-race warm-up is an important part of training, and chronologically the last piece of the puzzle before the starting gun goes off.

Elite marathoners work hard to keep their body at an optimal temperature up to the last possible moment, and during the 15 minutes before race time you’ll find them running their warm-up routines.

For top marketing performance, before a campaign begins it’s not the physical warm-up routine that will help during an imminent launch, but the psychological boost that comes from having reviewed all of the planning you and your team have done, and ensuring that you’re in the most positive state of mind when launch time arrives.
<h2>The Right Race Equipment &amp; Marketing Tools</h2>
Marketers and runners both need equipment to have the best performance possible, so let’s take a look at some of the lessons we can learn from our running and marketing equipment, as we move along to mile four.
<h2>Mile 4’s Lesson: The Shoe Hits the Pavement</h2>
For 99.9 percent of marathon runners — unless you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijk72IL6BDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abebe Bikila</a> who won gold sans shoes at the 1960 Olympics — wearing the right shoes will be an important part of your training and racing.

The time to learn which shoe works best for your feet is during training, keeping in mind that you should never allow yourself to make the rookie mistake of wearing brand new shoes on race day, even if they’re the same model you’ve used in your marathon build-up. Slight construction variations in shoes, along with wear patterns specific to your foot strike, mean that you should always race in a shoe you’ve trained in for at least a week or more.

The marketing tactics you’ll use in your campaigns represent similar important choices, and you won’t want to be trying unplanned and untested methods once your big campaign has launched — the time to test them is during your pre-launch planning phases.

Test your marketing tools and services on example campaigns, and use your team to uncover any shortcomings in the lead-up to launch, rather than in the days after your effort has gone live.

What’s that ahead — can it be the five mile marker already?
<h2>Mile 5’s Lesson: Wear Comfortable Shorts</h2>

<img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonC600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners on bridge image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26749" />

Finding the perfect running shorts for your marathon is another seemingly insignificant equipment choice that can have a surprising impact on the outcome of your race.

Shorts that have too many seams or other uncomfortable construction methods are likely to make you more and more uncomfortable as the miles go by.

As with shoes, the time to try out different shorts is in the weeks and months before your race, so resist the temptation to race in those flashy new shorts you just got at the marathon expo the day before the race.

Marketers too need to find the methods that work best for them over the long haul of a modern digital marketing campaign — one that is likely to last substantially longer than even an ultra-marathon.

Try to find and use the marketing solutions that augment and work alongside your strengths, and hold off on those that just aren’t in-line with the way you and your team work, or your desired campaign goals.
<h2>Mile 6’s Lesson: Use Tried &amp; True Socks &amp; Techniques</h2>
You might think that something like the choice of which socks to wear — or whether to wear any at all — during a marathon is insignificant, however<strong> in distance running as well as in marketing, even the smallest details can over time and miles add up to being either great assets, or debilitating troubles</strong>.

Race in socks you know well from training, with the right amount of padding, wicking abilities, and other performance features for your needs.

Similarly with marketing, don’t neglect the small details with campaign components such as proof-reading, testing, private trial runs to gather feedback, and other aspects of <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/content-marketing-project-management-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong project management</a> that your competitors may be skipping over.
<h2>Mile 7’s Lesson: Wear a Race-Worthy Singlet</h2>
The shirt or singlet you race your marathon in should be comfortable, with a minimal number of potentially abrasion-causing seams, made from modern wicking materials, and since it’s such a visible part of your race-day gear, you may want to choose one that speaks to your own personal fashion style.

Elite marathoners are usually required to wear the singlet featuring their sponsors’ logos, but at all other levels you’ll have great freedom to choose in this area.

Some runners use an easy trick to give themselves a small but powerful edge during the marathon: simply use a permanent marker to <strong>write your name on the front of your singlet</strong>. I did this one year running Grandma’s Marathon in my hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, and I got more encouragement from supporters lined up to watch the race than I’d had in all my previous marathons combined.

In marketing, how you package your campaign is similar to the choice of which singlet to wear. Certain B2B campaigns will require you to use very specific sponsorship images and messaging, while other campaigns will allow you to have nearly free reign over how your efforts will look when entering the digital world, whether it’s <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/social-media-video-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media video and messaging</a>, paid search advertising, or the new audio branding possible with <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/promote-b2b-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast marketing</a>.
<h2>Mile 8’s Lesson: Utilize Timing Chip &amp; Marketing Tech</h2>
When I first started running marathons in 1998, the ones I ran hadn’t yet adopted timing chip technology, where a small plastic clip containing an RFID chip is attached to a shoe, but not long after that nearly every marathon was using them, making it easy to record official times at checkpoints along the marathon course, and also helping family and friends wanting to track a racer’s progress during the marathon.

In many marketing campaigns, making it easy for customers and fans to share your digital asset and messages is also important — whether it’s a <a href="https://www.contentmarketingworld.com/greatest-show/index.html?utm_source=CTT&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=CMWorld2019Interactive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-blown interactive big top experience like the one we recently launched for Content Marketing World</a> — or a more traditional blog article or infographic.

Well done, marketers — the nine-mile marker is already in sight ahead!
<h2>Mile 9’s Lesson: Energize Along the Way</h2>
Fueling before, during, and after a marathon is an important piece of the racing puzzle, and also one you’ll want to work out and master before race day comes around.

Smart marathoners know which variety of energy gel or bars will be available at the aid stations along the course, and will either learn to run fueled by them during training, bring along their own favorite racing energy food sources, or have family and friends positioned on the course to have them ready.

A savvy marketing effort will also benefit from having pre-planned boosts of digital energy to invigorate and re-fuel a campaign as it progresses, which can come in the form of:
<ul>
 	<li>Daily or weekly social media promotions</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/content-gold-mines-conferences/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Special events</a> rolled out to coincide with your campaign</li>
 	<li>Contests and <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/07/power-social-media-polls/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polls</a> that are scheduled throughout your efforts</li>
</ul>
Could it be mile ten already? Why yes, there it is now, along with another marketing lesson from marathon running.
<h2>Mile 10’s Lesson: Get a Phone or Watch Advantage</h2>

<img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonD600w.jpg" alt="Runners touching colorful shoes together image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26750" />

I ran my first marathon using a GPS training device in 2003, when I set my then state-of-the-art Garmin Forerunner 201 to help keep me on pace for my goal time.

Its tiny low-resolution black-and-white screen showed a rudimentary stick figure and noted whether you were ahead or behind goal pace. That day I saw only one other person wearing a GPS device.

Today however, it’s hard to find a marathoner who isn’t using one — whether it’s a sport-specific watch or pod, or a cellphone in an armband using a dedicated running app such as iSmoothRun, my personal favorite.

In the same way, successful digital marketers are always adopting new technologies to improve their efforts.

[bctt tweet="“The most successful digital marketers are always adopting new technologies to improve their efforts.” — Lane R. Ellis @lanerellis" username="toprank"]

Some tools are built to help keep your campaign efforts on pace to reach your goals, just as in marathon running, while others are focused on planning or post-campaign data mining and analytics.

Finding the right marketing tools in an ever-expanding sea of choices can be daunting, however we’ve done plenty of research and in the following articles dig in to some of the most powerful utilities available for B2B marketers:

</ul>
<h2>Mile 11’s Lesson: Don’t Forget Your Hat</h2>
A good hat is another piece of marathon running equipment you’ll likely want to have on race day, if not to keep out the sun, at least to soak up the sweat a race-effort marathon will produce on all but the chilliest days.

Another seemingly minor decision, hats have been known to play a factor in the outcome of a marathon. During the 2016 U.S. Olympic Marathon trials, famed runner and now top coach Alberto Salazar went to a level of preparation not previously seen, when on an exceedingly hot race day he provided his runner Galen Rupp with new dry icy cool hats at various points along the course. Rupp went on to win the race, and ultimately earned a medal at that year’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

[bctt tweet="“In today’s fiercely-competitive marketing world, a fanatical attention to the minute details can be all that separates a Cannes award-winning campaign from one relegated to the digital dustbin of marketing history.” @lanerellis" username="toprank"]

<h2>Mile 12’s Lesson: Marketing So Bright You’ll Need Sunglasses</h2>
Sunglasses can of course help runners block out sun, but they can also help inspire and provide motivation, through the use of the many varieties of colorful lenses available.

For several years I reserved a special pair of sunglasses with yellow-tinted lenses for marathon day, and knew that when I was seeing the world through them that it was time to focus all my hard training on the immediate task ahead: hitting my mile splits, one at a time, through to the finish line.

In marketing, we may not have special sunglasses, but when campaign roll-out day comes, we can utilize a wide variety of special means of encouragement to help us focus on our goals.

For some this may be waking earlier than normal, doing extra exercise, eating in an especially healthy manner, or simply using music that energizes and encourages you to do your best work.
<h2>Mile 13’s Lesson: Your Unique Identification Number</h2>
In each marathon’s pre-race package you’ll find a number bib to pin to your singlet — a unique identifying number for race officials and spectators alike to track and chart your progress during the race.

Without a number bib a racer would be what’s known as a race bandit -- someone who’s jumped in the race without paying.

Marketing campaigns also have their own unique names and numbers, whether it’s an internal company code name, an official campaign effort name, or one of the identification numbers used by the various tools we use to track campaign performance against goals.

Whether you’re the top-seeded racer wearing the #1 from winning the previous year or #22839, it’s your job in both running and marketing to <strong>make the most of what you have from the position you’re starting in</strong>.

Marketing efforts can cause formerly small clients to achieve skyrocketing success when done very well, and for marathon runners one of the great unifying aspects is that everyone starts running at the same time and, theoretically, even someone at the back of the pack could win. There have even been cases where elite marathoners have shown up late to a race and gone on to catch up to the leaders after passing thousands of runners, something also sometimes possible in marketing.
<h2>On Your Mark — Get Set — Go!</h2>

Now that you have your training, planning, and equipment lined up and in order, let’s move on to strategy for actually hitting the starting line in both marathon running and marketing.
<h2>Mile 14’s Lesson: Starting Line’s Launch Day!</h2>
This is it! The months and seemingly endless miles of training are complete. Every pre-race ritual has been attended to, and you’re completely prepared to run the best marathon you can for the day.

While the starting line is a place to focus on the difficult task ahead, don’t forget to at least give some acknowledgement to all the effort you’ve made to reach this point, and to think of all those who have helped you along the way.

The energy and excitement at the starting line of a marathon, whether large or small, is one of the most amazing experiences in all of running, and smart runners won’t block it out entirely, but learn to feed on and draw energy from these magic moments.

Launch day for marketers is similar, as a time to focus intently on the efforts ahead, to recall the expert planning you’ve done to give your campaign the best chance of digital success, and to think of and thank the people who have helped you reach launch day.
<h2>Mile 15’s Lesson: Keep To Your Plan &amp; Don’t Zoom Out</h2>
Going out too fast is one of the most common mistakes new marathon runners make on race day, as the pre-race excitement and pent-up emotions all let loose when the starting gun goes off, and hundreds of runners all around you dart speedily onward.

Knowing that most runners will start too fast, smart runners hold back and work hard to stick to their predetermined mile-by-mile pacing plan, whether it’s through using the virtual training partner on your phone or smart watch, sticking to a pacing group, or simply by starting out running at a pace that feels too slow compared to those around you.

[bctt tweet="“Motivation remains key to the marathon: the motivation to begin; the motivation to continue; the motivation never to quit.” Hal Higdon @higdonmarathon " username="toprank"]

Most marathons have runners line up in sections corresponding to their goal finishing time, with elite runners on the actual starting line, and others positioned at spots set aside for those expecting to finish in three, four, five or more hours.

B2B marketers can also learn pacing lessons from marathon runners, as during campaign launches it’s important to not unleash more than you have allotted for launch day.
<h2>Mile 16’s Lesson: Hydrate &amp; Nurture Your Body &amp; Campaign</h2>
As the marathon progresses, smart runners will know exactly where every water and sports drink aid station is, from studying official pre-race information, and they’ll follow the plan they’ve carefully laid out and used on long runs in training.

Knowing how to best hydrate your body with water and sports drinks, and how to keep it cool using the sponges and shower misters on hand at many marathons, are also areas savvy runners will have learned and perfected in training.

As marketers we need to hydrate our campaigns too, by doing everything possible to keep our careful plans on track, with the skill to make quick adjustments on-the-fly as needed. Keeping up on the latest industry trends can help keep your marketing skills nimble, and here are three recent article we've published to help in that regard:

</ul>
<h2>Mile 17’s Lesson: Utilize Aid Stations &amp; Social Platforms</h2>

<img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonE600w.jpg" alt="Marathon runners racing image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26751" />

More than just tables to grab water from, marathon aid stations represent the important passage of miles along the course — just like the official mile markers — often festooned with colorful and fun markings such as balloons or even particular themes.

Many marathons have aid stations that are run by various non-profit or corporate organizations, each with their own unique style and flair, sometimes including radio stations with live bands. There are also usually many unofficial aid stations along big marathon courses, with supporters offering runners everything from strawberries and candy to beer and tequila.

In marketing, the social media platforms your campaign will nearly always use also each have their own unique rules, features, and strengths, and it’s up to you as a smart marketer to know how to get the most from each one in the grand scheme of your marketing efforts.

We’re explored some of the best ways to achieve success using the top social platforms in the following recent articles:

</ul>
<h2>Mile 18’s Lesson: Get a Boost From Your Fellow Racers</h2>
Even the most focused marathon runner will see and interact with fellow racers during the hours spent running, and these runners can provide valuable inspiration during the race if you leave yourself open to the connecting moments each race brings.

I remember running a marathon where a runner dressed in a full official U.S. Postal Service mail carrier outfit passed me mid-race, complete with a letter bag and black leather shoes. He drew cheers from the crowds and fellow runners alike, and ended up setting a fastest-known-time record for a marathon run in a full postal outfit.

Other years there have been people running marathons carrying full-size flags, and there always seen to be runners who race in costumes, such as Elvis impersonators or dinosaurs.

[bctt tweet="“Everything you ever wanted to know about yourself you can learn in 26.2 miles.” — Lori Culnane " username="toprank"]

A difficult aspect of marathon running to prepare for includes the inevitable runners you’ll encounter who are having a much worse day than you hopefully are — balled up in agony on the side of the road as severe cramps make them cry and moan.

Seeing these runners is a humbling experience, as each one was previously out there faster than you until the wheels fell off or they became sick or injured. Taking lessons from them can help you appreciate that fact that you are still moving ahead, even if you may not be precisely on your goal pace.

Sometimes you’ll even pass one or two elite runners who have for whatever reason been slowed to a walk or jog, and this too can serve to help you <strong>reflect on the small victories you’ve had</strong> within the marathon itself — a lesson that also applies to marketing.

Some marathon runners thrive on camaraderie during training and while racing, while others prefer to train and run alone.

As marketers, we can <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/online-offline-b2b-influencer-marketing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">universally benefit from relationship building</a>, whether it’s through using <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/linkedin-b2b-experts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industry experts</a> in a campaign, or the interaction with new clients brought about by smart and well-planned marketing efforts.
<h2>Mile 19’s Lesson: Renew with Your Cheering Section</h2>

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/26hit0GF1ZmM0WmD6" width="480" height="357" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/snl-saturday-night-live-1990s-26hit0GF1ZmM0WmD6">via GIPHY</a></p>

Having your own family and friends along the marathon course or at the finish will undoubtedly provide helpful cheering and encouragement during the race, so if you’re lucky enough to have them, take the time to thank them for coming out and supporting you on race day — if not during the race itself, once you’ve finished.

This holds true for marketers too of course, as the influencers, fans, clients, mentors and associates who’ve helped you and your campaign to succeed should also all be thanked, either in public, in private, or both.
<h2>Mile 20’s Lesson: Prepare For &amp; Overcome Rough Patches</h2>
In running, hitting a rough patch is often called <i>bonking</i>, and in marathoning this can often happen around mile 20, especially with new marathon runners.

[bctt tweet="“No marathon gets easier later. The half way point only marks the end of the beginning.” — Joe Henderson" username="toprank"]

It’s important to have alternate plans and time goals in place, and the flexibility to adjust your desired outcome depending on how badly you may be bonking, or worse yet, dealing with an in-race injury.

On race day, smart runners will also adjust their pacing and finish goals when Mother Nature throws difficult weather conditions into the mix. A rainy, especially hot and humid, or particularly cold day will see experienced marathoners adjusting their goals to meet the conditions at hand — a task experienced B2B marketers will also perform when unexpected elements out of their control strike a campaign.

Having a <i>plan b </i>or<i> plan c</i> are parts of planning that will help should the need ever arise.
<h2>Mile 21’s Lesson: Precisely Monitor Time &amp; Campaign Splits</h2>

<img src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019MarathonF600w.jpg" alt="Runners image." width="600" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26752" />

Throughout your race, and especially as you near the final 10K of a marathon, keeping track of the time splits you reach for each mile — which will show how far ahead or behind your time goal you are running — is an important task, and one that gets progressively difficult as your energy levels fall during the later stages of a marathon.

Before smart devices and phones, I used a pen to write my goal time splits on my palms. Later, running companies began offering wristbands with goal mile splits for various finish times from around a 2:45 marathon up to 5:30 or so.

Today, it’s easier than ever to track your mile splits during a marathon, so there’s little excuse for not knowing whether you need to try picking up the pace, or dialing it down a notch in order not to burn out.

As smart marketers we also note and celebrate important milestones during campaigns, and use tools to measure progress throughout the life-cycle of our marketing efforts, whether it’s audience engagement, reach, or other performance benchmarks. Here are several recent articles we've put together to help you with these important marketing tasks:

</ul>

<h2>Mile 22’s Lesson: Work with Groups and Influencers</h2>
Many larger marathons offer pacing groups to help runners reach specific time goals. The folks behind the CLIF bar helped pioneer marathon pacing groups, and for several marathons I ran alongside one of their excellent pacers — runners usually carrying a sign showing the pace group’s goal time, and sometimes also flags or balloons. Although their particular team is no longer in operation, others have taken up the slack.

It’s reassuring to be able to stick with your pacing group as planned, and equally frustrating to watch them fade into the distance ahead of you if you’re having a bad day on the marathon course.

As marketers we use <strong>influencers, industry experts, clients, customers, and sometimes fans</strong> to help us keep important campaigns on pace for hitting performance goals.
<h2>Mile 23’s Lesson: Marathon Mind-Tricks &amp; Marketing Mantras</h2>

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/WKpDdC94PKtJC" width="480" height="347" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-sci-fi-star-wars-WKpDdC94PKtJC">via GIPHY</a></p>

During the many hours spent running while training for a marathon, some runners develop subtle psychological practices to help them get through difficult patches. Some of these include:
<ul>
 	<li>Thinking of (or actually listening to, if you’re in a marathon that allows headphones…) an inspiring song</li>
 	<li>Repeating a personally-inspirational mantra, saying, or phrase</li>
 	<li>Making note of an upcoming tree or signpost and focusing only on making it that far, and then repeating the process again and again</li>
</ul>
Marketers too can benefit from focusing, keeping a positive attitude, and mindfully working to build up and keep the energy needed when launching and running a modern digital marketing campaign.

<h2>Mile 24’s Lesson: Track Those Marathon &amp; Marketing KPIs</h2>
Every marathon and marketing campaign will have certain very important key performance indicators (KPIs). For the marathon, these usually come at the 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and 20-mile marks.

Making your time split goals at these mileposts can be especially important in a runner’s mental efforts to stay on-track with reaching an overall race time finishing goal.

Similarly in marketing, <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/actionable-content-marketing-dashboard/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hitting important KPI levels</a> at various predetermined points along the campaign journey is especially important when it comes to reaching our overall goals.
<h2>Finish Line Fulfillment — Not the End But A New Beginning</h2>
You’ve come a long way now, and the end is nearing, so let’s take a look at how to get the very last drop of performance from your marathon and marketing efforts, and savor the hard-earned moment.

Can you believe that mile 25 is just up ahead now?!
<h2>Mile 25’s Lesson: Finish Line Celebrations</h2>

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/d2zUIKkRfLelQBE1zx" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/LondonMarathon-london-marathon-d2zUIKkRfLelQBE1zx">via GIPHY</a></p>

There’s nothing like the first glimpse of the finish line in a marathon, as it seems to induce your body’s final, hidden stores of energy to release — a boost that only seems to come out when the body knows its work will soon thankfully be done.

If a runner is ever going to feel a euphoric sense of elation, it’s most likely going to come while approaching the finish line of a marathon, knowing that nothing is going to stop you from crossing that line.

[bctt tweet="“If you want to run, run a mile. If you want to experience a different life, run a marathon.” — Emil Zatopek " username="toprank"]

It’s a great time to savor the moment and celebrate the weeks or months of hard training and planning, and the same can be said for the end of a successful marketing campaign.
<h2>Mile 26’s Lesson: Take Time To Recover &amp; Learn</h2>
After the many strong emotions of the finish line, whether they’re for celebrating a goal that’s been met, or disappointment in falling short despite your best efforts, the time will come when you can learn a great deal by examining in detail how your race went — what worked well and what failed.

Some runners like to write down their memories from a marathon as soon as possible after the race finishes, and marketers too can benefit from taking a look back once the campaign ends at what worked and what didn’t.

Having this first-hand analysis of our performance can be invaluable when the time comes to launch the next similar marketing initiative, or to run another marathon.

[bctt tweet="“You have to forget your last marathon before you try another. Your mind can't know what's coming.” — Frank Shorter " username="toprank"]

<h2>Mile 26.2’s Lesson: Go The Final Distance &amp; Win Awards</h2>
With hard work and fanatical training, a successful marathon may involve setting a new personal record, winning an age-group award, or at the highest level even winning an overall race medal outright.

In marketing, a great campaign can continue on long after it’s officially concluded, by providing a variety of <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/05/how-to-make-repurposed-content-cobbler/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opportunities for derivative works through re-purposing</a>, or even <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/5-innovative-b2b-examples/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">entering and winning various industry awards</a>.

Running marathons can help elevate our lives, enhance fitness, and bring newfound depth to each day, and great marketing can do the same as we <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/05/content-marketing-fitness/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boost our marketing fitness</a>.

Thanks for coming along for this 26.2 mile marketing marathon, and I hope you’ll find value in the lessons of each step we’ve shared on the journey together.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Is your content audience-centric?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Of course it is!” Says the hypothetical person I just made up. “We do intensive research for all our content. We look at questions our audience is asking, we hit up SEMrush and BuzzSumo...our content is all about our audience!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26739" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/thor.gif" alt="Marvel's Thor sarcastically asks &amp;quot;But is it, though?&amp;quot;" width="416" height="250" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Here’s the big question:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Beyond learning about your brand, which will enrich their lives in many exciting ways, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;what is your consumer getting out of your content?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Creating or deepening a brand relationship can’t be the only reason your content exists. Raising brand awareness can’t be the only reason your content exists. That’s not audience-centric content. People will quickly realize that and move on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Most marketers want to offer a genuine value exchange to our consumers. We’re not shriveled-hearted gargoyles trying to trick people into paying attention to us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But it’s easy to think you’re putting the audience first, when it’s really the brand in the spotlight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What follows are four questions that marketers commonly ask when creating content. These questions are crucial to content strategy — I’m not saying to throw them out. But let’s follow each one up with a question designed to center the content on the consumer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Four New Questions to Ask for Audience-Centric Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Make these new questions part of your content planning process, before you blog a single word or create a single promotional tweet. The answers will vary depending on your industry, your audience and their goals. It’s the asking that will help keep the balance between customer and brand-centered content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Earning Attention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Ask: “How can we get people’s attention?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;One of the fundamental challenges of modern content marketing is simply getting anyone to look at the content. People are distracted; every brand is creating content, and most of it is pretty good. Amplification is at least half of the battle for any content marketing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Should ALSO Ask: “How can we reward people’s attention?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Note this is not the same as “what message about our brand should people take away from this content.” This is the promise your content makes to the consumer. What new skill, new idea, or more efficient way of polishing billiard balls are you giving them? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;And yes, I know, this is content marketing 101 stuff. But it’s something that’s easy to lose sight of — the fundamental value exchange at the heart of content marketing. Make it part of your content planning. Add it to your template: “What promise are we making, and how are we fulfilling it?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The Next Step&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Ask: “What action do we want people to take?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Content marketing should inspire action. If we don’t know what next step we want people to take, we’re not marketing — we’re just publishing content for funsies. So this is a central question to content marketing that meets KPIs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Should ALSO Ask: “What action can we help people take?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;So a customer comes to your website, reads your latest asset, fills out a form, and gets on your mailing list. That’s a win for the brand. What constitutes a win for the customer? What is the next step in their personal development, professional development, or career path? How can your brand and your content help them take that next step?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For example: Our client Prophix, a finance software company, wanted to get the word out about their new PowerPoint integration functionality (brand goal). Together we helped address a bigger issue: Finance leaders need to give better presentations to have more influence in the company. We created a page where people can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2V0PObo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;learn how to be better presenters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Instead of devoting the page to promoting Prophix’s new feature, we devoted it to making finance folks better at their jobs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;And here’s the kicker: All that audience-focused content led to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/newsroom/long-form-influencer-videos-series-smashes-engagement-conversion-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;stellar results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; for the brand goal, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2V0PObo"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-26740 size-medium" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/prophix-1-300x202.png" alt="" width="300" height="202" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Ask: “How can we raise brand awareness?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Familiarity with a brand is a big part of making a purchase decision. That’s especially true in B2B. Your family might take a chance on a new brand of soda, but your business likely wants a well-known, trusted name for a multi-million dollar purchase. For many of our clients, just getting their name in front of people, building awareness and credibility, is a big goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Should ALSO Ask: “Why would people want to be aware of our brand?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;If you’re looking to establish a relationship with your customers, what are you bringing to that relationship? We can’t be the one who sits on the couch playing video games while the other person does all the cooking and cleaning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What higher purpose makes your brand inspiring, uplifting, worthy of being aware of? Here’s your challenge: Write a secondary mission statement for the brand that doesn’t mention your product or service area at all. Before you try to raise awareness and build relationships, discover the values that will make your brand attractive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Long-Term Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Ask, “How do we define success for our marketing efforts?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Measurement and optimization are the building blocks of exceptional marketing. We should always have a clear idea of what success looks like to measure against and optimize toward. That means establishing KPIs, the metrics to measure them, and benchmarks to compare progress. We use a combination of industry benchmark results from campaigns with similar clients for comparison purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Should ALSO ask: “How do we define success for our audience?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This question ties in with the purpose question. It requires your brand to have values beyond your product offering, values that reach out to customers even outside of their brand interactions. If your company truly prizes your customers and is dedicated to helping them succeed, what does that success look like?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Think about what your marketing would look like if you had as strategic a plan for your audience as you do for your business. “This content will help them look great in front of their boss. This campaign will help build the confidence they need to get promoted. This content will put them on the executive track.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Imagine measuring your audience success along with your content’s KPIs. Of course, we may not go as far as to stalk people on LinkedIn to see if our content is helping them… but plan your content as though you were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Audience-Centered Content Gets Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You don’t have to choose whether your content will serve your marketing goals or the customer’s needs. Best-answer content that puts the customer first will do more for your marketing goals than the most aggressively promotional content you can imagine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Most marketers start off with an audience-focused mindset. But it’s easy to get caught up in promotion, in moving people through the funnel, and lose sight of what value you’re offering consumers in return.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Before you start the next content planning session, take a step back, ask these new questions, and confirm that you’re focused on your audience, rather than asking your audience to focus on you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn how audience-focused content helped the &lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/newsroom/seo-plus-content-plus-influence-equal-116-percent-boost-in-engagement-for-saas-leader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP App Center&lt;/a&gt; boost engagement by 116%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your content audience-centric?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course it is!” Says the hypothetical person I just made up. “We do intensive research for all our content. We look at questions our audience is asking, we hit up SEMrush and BuzzSumo...our content is all about our audience!”</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26739" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/thor.gif" alt="Marvel's Thor sarcastically asks &quot;But is it, though?&quot;" width="416" height="250" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the big question:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond learning about your brand, which will enrich their lives in many exciting ways, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is your consumer getting out of your content?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating or deepening a brand relationship can’t be the only reason your content exists. Raising brand awareness can’t be the only reason your content exists. That’s not audience-centric content. People will quickly realize that and move on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most marketers want to offer a genuine value exchange to our consumers. We’re not shriveled-hearted gargoyles trying to trick people into paying attention to us. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s easy to think you’re putting the audience first, when it’s really the brand in the spotlight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What follows are four questions that marketers commonly ask when creating content. These questions are crucial to content strategy — I’m not saying to throw them out. But let’s follow each one up with a question designed to center the content on the consumer. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four New Questions to Ask for Audience-Centric Content</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Make these new questions part of your content planning process, before you blog a single word or create a single promotional tweet. The answers will vary depending on your industry, your audience and their goals. It’s the asking that will help keep the balance between customer and brand-centered content.</span>
<h3>1. Earning Attention</h3>
<b>We Ask: “How can we get people’s attention?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the fundamental challenges of modern content marketing is simply getting anyone to look at the content. People are distracted; every brand is creating content, and most of it is pretty good. Amplification is at least half of the battle for any content marketing.</span>

<b>We Should ALSO Ask: “How can we reward people’s attention?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note this is not the same as “what message about our brand should people take away from this content.” This is the promise your content makes to the consumer. What new skill, new idea, or more efficient way of polishing billiard balls are you giving them? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And yes, I know, this is content marketing 101 stuff. But it’s something that’s easy to lose sight of — the fundamental value exchange at the heart of content marketing. Make it part of your content planning. Add it to your template: “What promise are we making, and how are we fulfilling it?”</span>
<h3>2. The Next Step</h3>
<b>We Ask: “What action do we want people to take?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing should inspire action. If we don’t know what next step we want people to take, we’re not marketing — we’re just publishing content for funsies. So this is a central question to content marketing that meets KPIs.</span>

<b>We Should ALSO Ask: “What action can we help people take?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So a customer comes to your website, reads your latest asset, fills out a form, and gets on your mailing list. That’s a win for the brand. What constitutes a win for the customer? What is the next step in their personal development, professional development, or career path? How can your brand and your content help them take that next step?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example: Our client Prophix, a finance software company, wanted to get the word out about their new PowerPoint integration functionality (brand goal). Together we helped address a bigger issue: Finance leaders need to give better presentations to have more influence in the company. We created a page where people can </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2V0PObo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn how to be better presenters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of devoting the page to promoting Prophix’s new feature, we devoted it to making finance folks better at their jobs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And here’s the kicker: All that audience-focused content led to </span><a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/newsroom/long-form-influencer-videos-series-smashes-engagement-conversion-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stellar results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the brand goal, too.</span>

<a href="http://bit.ly/2V0PObo"><img class="alignnone wp-image-26740 size-medium" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/prophix-1-300x202.png" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a>
<h3>3. The Purpose</h3>
<b>We Ask: “How can we raise brand awareness?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Familiarity with a brand is a big part of making a purchase decision. That’s especially true in B2B. Your family might take a chance on a new brand of soda, but your business likely wants a well-known, trusted name for a multi-million dollar purchase. For many of our clients, just getting their name in front of people, building awareness and credibility, is a big goal.</span>

<b>We Should ALSO Ask: “Why would people want to be aware of our brand?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to establish a relationship with your customers, what are you bringing to that relationship? We can’t be the one who sits on the couch playing video games while the other person does all the cooking and cleaning. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What higher purpose makes your brand inspiring, uplifting, worthy of being aware of? Here’s your challenge: Write a secondary mission statement for the brand that doesn’t mention your product or service area at all. Before you try to raise awareness and build relationships, discover the values that will make your brand attractive.</span>
<h3><strong>4. The Long-Term Goals</strong></h3>
<b>We Ask, “How do we define success for our marketing efforts?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Measurement and optimization are the building blocks of exceptional marketing. We should always have a clear idea of what success looks like to measure against and optimize toward. That means establishing KPIs, the metrics to measure them, and benchmarks to compare progress. We use a combination of industry benchmark results from campaigns with similar clients for comparison purposes.</span>

<b>We Should ALSO ask: “How do we define success for our audience?”</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This question ties in with the purpose question. It requires your brand to have values beyond your product offering, values that reach out to customers even outside of their brand interactions. If your company truly prizes your customers and is dedicated to helping them succeed, what does that success look like?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about what your marketing would look like if you had as strategic a plan for your audience as you do for your business. “This content will help them look great in front of their boss. This campaign will help build the confidence they need to get promoted. This content will put them on the executive track.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine measuring your audience success along with your content’s KPIs. Of course, we may not go as far as to stalk people on LinkedIn to see if our content is helping them… but plan your content as though you were.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience-Centered Content Gets Results</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to choose whether your content will serve your marketing goals or the customer’s needs. Best-answer content that puts the customer first will do more for your marketing goals than the most aggressively promotional content you can imagine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most marketers start off with an audience-focused mindset. But it’s easy to get caught up in promotion, in moving people through the funnel, and lose sight of what value you’re offering consumers in return.</span>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Always remember that you are communicating to people. Eliminate innovative, cutting-edge, mission-critical, best-of-breed gobbledygook from your writing. Using the same inane language as everybody else ensures you are lost in the crowd.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Show don’t tell. In order to create an engaging user experience on social platforms, you need to be able to show users something from their perspective not yours. You need to be able to reach into their heart, put your fingers around it, and feel the pulse beat. And video, when done right, can do just that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Great content isn’t about platitudes. It’s about provocation. Incitement. Taking a stand and making your audience think in a new way. Giving the counter-argument to conventional wisdom. When we do that, we advance the dialogue, rather than diminish it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ignore Your Competitors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Marketers need to stop placing so much emphasis on catching up or edging out their direct competitors. Customers don’t compare you to your competitors anymore—they compare you to other positive experiences they’ve had. If you keep chasing what your competitors are doing, you’re always a step behind. That’s a good way to go out of business because you’re just doing what someone else is already doing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Celebrating success and championing internal entrepreneurship is key: Great ideas can come from anywhere. We are limited only by the constraints we inflict on our vision. So I try to make sure everybody with an idea they think has potential feels they can bring it to my doorstep. That doesn’t mean every idea gets the green light, but it does mean that every idea is heard.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Comedy is the most powerful way to humanize a brand because it demonstrates empathy. Let’s face it, a lot of true comedy comes from pain. So, when we can come out and touch on a customer pain point, we show them that we understand their point of view. When we do something that is self-deprecating, when we look vulnerable, and when we let our guard down a little bit that’s when we make a connection.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Year over year, we’ve seen consumer trust of brands decreasing, and people turning to seemingly more objective sources when making buying decisions: peers, 3rd party review sites, analysts, etc. Partnering with an influencer allows you to highlight your brand’s own existing narrative in a new way, so that you can reinforce the proof points you really want your customers to know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Put the Story First&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Create a structure for creating content that always begins with a story your reader can identify with and uses this moment to bridge their point of view with your brand’s unique selling point. Many marketers still talk about their products and services in terms of what they can do for their audience rather than what the audience cares about, why that’s important and how their solution can help solve the problem. Stories have the power to engage prospects with an emotional hook that endears them to a brand more successfully than standard marketing copy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“It’s important to slow down our marketing to get the basics right. Like developing a documented content strategy. Like doing the required research. Like developing robust, non-one-dimensional Flat Stanley buyer personas. Like articulating your bigger story. Like investing in quality: excellent writing (and editing) and storytelling.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“We have the people, the data, and the tools to create engaging content at scale, yet we often jumpstart the process of creating content without the required thoughtfulness on the initial critical steps. It is essential to be clear which audiences we are targeting and subsequently to define clear goals for the message we are creating. To this day, most brands need to improve at this stage, otherwise the best content marketer in the world cannot create an effective piece of engaging content.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“We want customers to feel a part of the brand. We want them to feel like the brand belongs to them. But then too often we send out ‘one size fits most’ messages… and wonder why we don’t get that sense of belonging that’s a hallmark of great brands. Your brand is not for everyone. It isn’t. It’s for the people who want something you can help them get, who value the same things you do, and who see the world the same way you do. And that’s not everyone. Full stop.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Most of our content fails. Like, over 90% of it. And that’s not at all uncommon in the content marketing world. If everyone knew the exact ingredients to a “viral” content piece, that’s all anyone would produce. But we don’t know. Pieces I think will do really well, more-often-than-not sink without a trace, and pieces that seem like throwaways can take off because they’ve tapped into some pent-up need in the marketplace of ideas.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rarely does anyone want the same old, same old. So, don’t give your audience more of the same. Use the advice above to your advantage and break the norm, separate yourself from the pack, try something new, or reiterate on a great idea. The more you can break the mold, the more you’ll stand out amongst the crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You have to accept and adapt to what your audience needs and wants at any given moment. It takes speed, flexibility, bold ideas, fearlessness, and more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Always remember that you are communicating to people. Eliminate innovative, cutting-edge, mission-critical, best-of-breed gobbledygook from your writing. Using the same inane language as everybody else ensures you are lost in the crowd.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Show don’t tell. In order to create an engaging user experience on social platforms, you need to be able to show users something from their perspective not yours.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great content isn’t about platitudes. It’s about provocation. Incitement. Taking a stand and making your audience think in a new way. Giving the counter-argument to conventional wisdom. When we do that, we advance the dialogue, rather than diminish it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Marketers need to stop placing so much emphasis on catching up or edging out their direct competitors. Customers don’t compare you to your competitors anymore—they compare you to other positive experiences they’ve had. If you keep chasing what your competitors are doing, you’re always a step behind. That’s a good way to go out of business because you’re just doing what someone else is already doing.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Celebrating success and championing internal entrepreneurship is key: Great ideas can come from anywhere. We are limited only by the constraints we inflict on our vision. So I try to make sure everybody with an idea they think has potential feels they can bring it to my doorstep. That doesn’t mean every idea gets the green light, but it does mean that every idea is heard.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Comedy is the most powerful way to humanize a brand because it demonstrates empathy. Let’s face it, a lot of true comedy comes from pain. So, when we can come out and touch on a customer pain point, we show them that we understand their point of view. When we do something that is self-deprecating, when we look vulnerable, and when we let our guard down a little bit that’s when we make a connection.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Year over year, we’ve seen consumer trust of brands decreasing, and people turning to seemingly more objective sources when making buying decisions: peers, 3rd party review sites, analysts, etc. Partnering with an influencer allows you to highlight your brand’s own existing narrative in a new way, so that you can reinforce the proof points you really want your customers to know.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Create a structure for creating content that always begins with a story your reader can identify with and uses this moment to bridge their point of view with your brand’s unique selling point. Many marketers still talk about their products and services in terms of what they can do for their audience rather than what the audience cares about, why that’s important and how their solution can help solve the problem. Stories have the power to engage prospects with an emotional hook that endears them to a brand more successfully than standard marketing copy.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s important to slow down our marketing to get the basics right. Like developing a documented content strategy. Like doing the required research. Like developing robust, non-one-dimensional Flat Stanley buyer personas. Like articulating your bigger story. Like investing in quality: excellent writing (and editing) and storytelling.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have the people, the data, and the tools to create engaging content at scale, yet we often jumpstart the process of creating content without the required thoughtfulness on the initial critical steps. It is essential to be clear which audiences we are targeting and subsequently to define clear goals for the message we are creating. To this day, most brands need to improve at this stage, otherwise the best content marketer in the world cannot create an effective piece of engaging content.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want customers to feel a part of the brand. We want them to feel like the brand belongs to them. But then too often we send out ‘one size fits most’ messages… and wonder why we don’t get that sense of belonging that’s a hallmark of great brands. Your brand is not for everyone. It isn’t. It’s for the people who want something you can help them get, who value the same things you do, and who see the world the same way you do. And that’s not everyone. Full stop.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of our content fails. Like, over 90% of it. And that’s not at all uncommon in the content marketing world. If everyone knew the exact ingredients to a “viral” content piece, that’s all anyone would produce. But we don’t know. Pieces I think will do really well, more-often-than-not sink without a trace, and pieces that seem like throwaways can take off because they’ve tapped into some pent-up need in the marketplace of ideas.”</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not the Norm, and Proud Of It</span></h2>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;I’ve never been very good at saving money — unless I’m saving for something specific. Give me a defined target, and the intrinsic motivation that comes along with it, and I’ll get there. There is much to be said about the value of focus in achieving a goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The same philosophy is at play with &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2017/01/get-started-account-based-marketing/"&gt;account-based marketing&lt;/a&gt; (ABM). Everyone knows it’s important to bolster a business pipeline — just as it’s smart to save money — but lacking clear direction can be a hindrance. This is especially true at a time where B2B prospects crave personalization and tailored experiences more than ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As the saying goes, if you’re talking to everyone, you’re talking to no one. ABM provides a focused framework for pursuing your ideal prospective customers. Here comes the twist: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/influencer-marketing/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Influencer marketing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; can be the perfect pairing with the approach, providing additional voices who can speak authentically and credibly to the exact people you want to reach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="As the saying goes, if you’re talking to everyone, you’re talking to no one. And that's one reason why #ABM and #InfluencerMarketing can be a perfect pairing. @NickNelsonMN" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;How Account-Based Marketing Works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There’s nothing too complicated about it. Basically, rather creating buyer personas and orienting your B2B marketing strategy toward companies that are similar, you instead identify specific companies you’d love to have as customers, then align your strategy more directly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once you’re able to win an account’s business, you can shift focus to growing the partnership through upselling, cross-selling, and referrals — a technique often referred to as “land and expand.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This graphic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/account-based-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;via SuperOffice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, provides a visual explanation of how the ABM process differs from a traditional sales funnel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone wp-image-26713" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/ABM-IM.png" alt="" width="550" height="316" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The prevalence of ABM is growing rapidly as B2B organizations come to embrace the logic behind it. Research found that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/account-based-marketing-abm/abm-still-a-trend-for-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;61% of companies reported having an established ABM practice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; in 2018, up from 36% in 2017. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Combining ABM with Influencer Marketing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In general, B2B marketing is undergoing a fundamental shift — from quantity to quality. Savvy organizations recognize that meaningful engagement is far more valuable than overall reach, so they’re refining their strategies to connect with the right prospects, rather than emphasizing vanity metric volume. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;At TopRank Marketing, we follow a similar mantra with influencers. It’s not about who has the most followers, or the gaudiest personal brand. It’s about who resonates most with your specific customers and prospects. ABM helps bring clarity to the matter because you can more confidently pinpoint individuals who are influential with the precise businesses you wish to win over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Once you’ve defined a list of target accounts, you can begin to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/buyers-versus-buying-committees/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;map out their buying committees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and gather insight around the individuals who are likely to impact purchase decisions. When marrying your influencer strategy to your ABM program, you’ll want to consider questions like these:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who is influential to people within your targeted accounts?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Based on their professional networks and social media activities, which influencers do they pay attention to and trust? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What topics do your target accounts talk about most? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Try to get as specific as you can, then seek out micro-influencers and niche experts with authority in that particular area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who will the people in your target accounts be able to relate to?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/how-avoid-fauxthenticity-pitfalls/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Authenticity is essential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; for influencer engagements. You’ll want to identify candidates at similar-sized companies, and with similar roles/functions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;When it comes to making a bottom-line impact, you’ll especially want to concentrate on finding partners with purchasing influence (i.e., they can speak from experience or expertise about your solution and its benefits) for co-creation of content. In essence, this knocks out two birds with one stone, assisting with the development of powerful assets that can activate the influence of your collaborators. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Bring Focus to Your Marketing Strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;B2B influencer marketing isn’t about enlisting the trendiest Instagram celeb with the most followers. (Well, it is for some companies, but those ones tend to struggle with it.) Instead, it’s about finding the perfect alignment with your audience. Nothing brings more clarity and precision to understanding your audience than ABM, which swaps out theoretical personas for actual organizations and people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This intersection of ABM and influencer marketing represents one of the most promising frontiers for B2B marketing, especially when it comes to the pursuit of enterprise customers. Not only do influencer partnerships help you break through and gain visibility with busy decision makers at these coveted accounts, but also drive engagement and persuasively move the needle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never been very good at saving money — unless I’m saving for something specific. Give me a defined target, and the intrinsic motivation that comes along with it, and I’ll get there. There is much to be said about the value of focus in achieving a goal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The same philosophy is at play with <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2017/01/get-started-account-based-marketing/">account-based marketing</a> (ABM). Everyone knows it’s important to bolster a business pipeline — just as it’s smart to save money — but lacking clear direction can be a hindrance. This is especially true at a time where B2B prospects crave personalization and tailored experiences more than ever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the saying goes, if you’re talking to everyone, you’re talking to no one. ABM provides a focused framework for pursuing your ideal prospective customers. Here comes the twist: </span><a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/influencer-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be the perfect pairing with the approach, providing additional voices who can speak authentically and credibly to the exact people you want to reach.</span>

[bctt tweet="As the saying goes, if you’re talking to everyone, you’re talking to no one. And that's one reason why #ABM and #InfluencerMarketing can be a perfect pairing. @NickNelsonMN" username="toprank"]
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Account-Based Marketing Works</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s nothing too complicated about it. Basically, rather creating buyer personas and orienting your B2B marketing strategy toward companies that are similar, you instead identify specific companies you’d love to have as customers, then align your strategy more directly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re able to win an account’s business, you can shift focus to growing the partnership through upselling, cross-selling, and referrals — a technique often referred to as “land and expand.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This graphic, </span><a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/account-based-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via SuperOffice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, provides a visual explanation of how the ABM process differs from a traditional sales funnel:</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-26713" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/ABM-IM.png" alt="" width="550" height="316" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prevalence of ABM is growing rapidly as B2B organizations come to embrace the logic behind it. Research found that </span><a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/account-based-marketing-abm/abm-still-a-trend-for-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">61% of companies reported having an established ABM practice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, up from 36% in 2017. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining ABM with Influencer Marketing</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, B2B marketing is undergoing a fundamental shift — from quantity to quality. Savvy organizations recognize that meaningful engagement is far more valuable than overall reach, so they’re refining their strategies to connect with the right prospects, rather than emphasizing vanity metric volume. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At TopRank Marketing, we follow a similar mantra with influencers. It’s not about who has the most followers, or the gaudiest personal brand. It’s about who resonates most with your specific customers and prospects. ABM helps bring clarity to the matter because you can more confidently pinpoint individuals who are influential with the precise businesses you wish to win over.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve defined a list of target accounts, you can begin to </span><a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/06/buyers-versus-buying-committees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map out their buying committees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and gather insight around the individuals who are likely to impact purchase decisions. When marrying your influencer strategy to your ABM program, you’ll want to consider questions like these:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Who is influential to people within your targeted accounts?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Based on their professional networks and social media activities, which influencers do they pay attention to and trust? </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>What topics do your target accounts talk about most? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to get as specific as you can, then seek out micro-influencers and niche experts with authority in that particular area.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Who will the people in your target accounts be able to relate to?</b> <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/how-avoid-fauxthenticity-pitfalls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authenticity is essential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for influencer engagements. You’ll want to identify candidates at similar-sized companies, and with similar roles/functions.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to making a bottom-line impact, you’ll especially want to concentrate on finding partners with purchasing influence (i.e., they can speak from experience or expertise about your solution and its benefits) for co-creation of content. In essence, this knocks out two birds with one stone, assisting with the development of powerful assets that can activate the influence of your collaborators. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bring Focus to Your Marketing Strategy</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B influencer marketing isn’t about enlisting the trendiest Instagram celeb with the most followers. (Well, it is for some companies, but those ones tend to struggle with it.) Instead, it’s about finding the perfect alignment with your audience. Nothing brings more clarity and precision to understanding your audience than ABM, which swaps out theoretical personas for actual organizations and people.</span>

&lt;p&gt;Not all forms of content creation will make you famous, but some come with built-in amplification boosts that can put you well on your way to star-quality promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with industry experts and influencers to co-create content is a proven tactic for adding more inherent promotion right from the start of your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harnessing the power of industry events, keeping abreast of trend forecast data, and incorporating interactive elements are also tactics that can significantly up your content promotion game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at all of these methods and more, and see how to best utilize each, including examples showing how each tactic has driven star-quality success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/qoBUEG1jKBhcY" width="480" height="275" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/other-almost-famous-qoBUEG1jKBhcY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tactic #1 — Co-Creation With Industry Experts &amp;amp; Influencers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25455" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/TopRankMarketingTeamwork600w.jpg" alt="Women's rowing team image." width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you call them industry experts or influencers, when you work with noted figures in your profession and include their insight along with your own, you'll both reap rewards on several levels by joining together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-created content will by nature provide promotion potential that is greater than the sum of its individual parts, as the value and relevance industry experts add to your content makes it something that not only your target audience will want to learn from and share, but which also benefits from the additional sharing and social amplification influencers can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="For any kind of content a business creates and publishes to the world, there is an opportunity for collaboration with credible voices that have active networks interested in what those voices have to say. @LeeOdden" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/toprank/status/1146054808497004544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;poll on our Twitter channel&lt;/a&gt; asked B2B marketers what their biggest influencer marketing hurdles were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26705" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019July2.png" alt="TopRank Marketing Twitter influencer marketing poll" width="584" height="472" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this informal poll measuring, impact was seen as the top hurdle, which highlights the importance of having an accurate data analytics strategy. I’ve written about this in “&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/12/analytics-approaches-for-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;New Year, New View: 3 Ways to Approach Analytics in 2019&lt;/a&gt;,” including specific tips for dealing with influencer marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right influencers for your industry has also been a top concern, and a key element in strong influencer partnerships is the ability to share in mutual benefits, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lucymoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Luciana Moran&lt;/a&gt; of Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet has pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="In order to be successful, the work has to be mutually beneficial to both parties. @lucymoran on #B2BInfluencerMarketing" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She shared some of the &lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/b2b-influencer-marketing-luciana-dnb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;challenges and rewards of working with influencers in an interview with Lee&lt;/a&gt; that is a helpful resource if you're looking to develop or improve your own influencer marketing program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With multiple recent estimates predicting influencer marketing as a $10 billion industry by 2020, including 35% growth through 2025, getting influencer marketing right will be more important than ever, which is why many B2B firms turn to a professional marketing agency specializing in the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TopRank Marketing was named by Forrester as the only B2B marketing agency offering influencer marketing as a top capability in its latest “&lt;a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/newsroom/forrester-b2b-marketing-agencies-toprank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;B2B Marketing Agencies, North America, Q1 2019” report.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tactic #2 — The Promotional Power of Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry events bring people together, and the collective promotional potential they offer when smartly utilized is a tactic that’s sometimes overlooked, so we’ll explore some of the ways conferences, trade-shows, and other professional events can amplify your marketing campaign efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get you started in event-related content promotion and how to utilize the items listed above, here are three recent articles we're written:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tactic #3 — Promotion From Relevant Trend Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26022" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/b2b-influencer-marketing-trends-2019.jpg" alt="B2B Influencer Marketing Trends" width="600" height="338" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing where your industry is and where it has been are important factors in creating top-quality, relevant promotional efforts, however what can set a campaign apart is having the forward-thinking insight that can only come from a thorough examination of future trend forecast and analysis information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leeodden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Lee Odden&lt;/a&gt; recently shared his latest trends relating to B2B influencer marketing, published in infographic format at Social Media Today, in “&lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/the-top-b2b-influencer-marketing-trends-for-2020-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The Top B2B Influencer Marketing Trends for 2020 [Infographic]&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s live-chat — either automated or with an actual person — real-time virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR), in-content playable moments, or any number of the new methods for two-way online communication, adding interactive elements to your content is a fantastic way to build a stronger connection with your customers and target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bctt tweet="“Creating compelling experiences with interactive content is one way to stand out, differentiate, and optimize for effectiveness.” @LeeOdden" username="toprank"]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign combined expert insight from top industry experts including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaybaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Jay Baer&lt;/a&gt; of Convince &amp;amp; Convert, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarketingProfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ann Handley&lt;/a&gt; of MarketingProfs, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottMonty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Scott Monty&lt;/a&gt; of Scott Monty Strategies, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RachelJRichter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Rachel Richter&lt;/a&gt; of Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet and others, with enticing and useful interactive elements to bring Adobe’s CXM to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactive elements was the top choice in this informal poll, highlighting their power to drive engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube recently &lt;a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/youtube-launches-ar-virtual-try-on-capabilities-with-mac-cosmetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;announced new augmented reality (AR) advertising options&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available later this summer through its influencer marketing platform, FameBit — an example of how the world’s largest video platform is expanding its use of interactive content elements.&lt;/p&gt;

Not all forms of content creation will make you famous, but some come with built-in amplification boosts that can put you well on your way to star-quality promotion.

Working with industry experts and influencers to co-create content is a proven tactic for adding more inherent promotion right from the start of your campaign.

Harnessing the power of industry events, keeping abreast of trend forecast data, and incorporating interactive elements are also tactics that can significantly up your content promotion game.

Let’s take a look at all of these methods and more, and see how to best utilize each, including examples showing how each tactic has driven star-quality success.

<h2>Tactic #1 — Co-Creation With Industry Experts &amp; Influencers</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25455" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/TopRankMarketingTeamwork600w.jpg" alt="Women's rowing team image." width="600" height="360" />

Whether you call them industry experts or influencers, when you work with noted figures in your profession and include their insight along with your own, you'll both reap rewards on several levels by joining together.

Co-created content will by nature provide promotion potential that is greater than the sum of its individual parts, as the value and relevance industry experts add to your content makes it something that not only your target audience will want to learn from and share, but which also benefits from the additional sharing and social amplification influencers can provide.

[bctt tweet="For any kind of content a business creates and publishes to the world, there is an opportunity for collaboration with credible voices that have active networks interested in what those voices have to say. @LeeOdden" username="toprank"]

A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/toprank/status/1146054808497004544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll on our Twitter channel</a> asked B2B marketers what their biggest influencer marketing hurdles were:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26705" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019July2.png" alt="TopRank Marketing Twitter influencer marketing poll" width="584" height="472" />

In this informal poll measuring, impact was seen as the top hurdle, which highlights the importance of having an accurate data analytics strategy. I’ve written about this in “<a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/12/analytics-approaches-for-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Year, New View: 3 Ways to Approach Analytics in 2019</a>,” including specific tips for dealing with influencer marketing.

Finding the right influencers for your industry has also been a top concern, and a key element in strong influencer partnerships is the ability to share in mutual benefits, as <a href="https://twitter.com/lucymoran" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luciana Moran</a> of Dun &amp; Bradstreet has pointed out.

[bctt tweet="In order to be successful, the work has to be mutually beneficial to both parties. @lucymoran on #B2BInfluencerMarketing" username="toprank"]

She shared some of the <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/b2b-influencer-marketing-luciana-dnb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges and rewards of working with influencers in an interview with Lee</a> that is a helpful resource if you're looking to develop or improve your own influencer marketing program.

With multiple recent estimates predicting influencer marketing as a $10 billion industry by 2020, including 35% growth through 2025, getting influencer marketing right will be more important than ever, which is why many B2B firms turn to a professional marketing agency specializing in the practice.

TopRank Marketing was named by Forrester as the only B2B marketing agency offering influencer marketing as a top capability in its latest “<a href="https://www.toprankmarketing.com/newsroom/forrester-b2b-marketing-agencies-toprank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B Marketing Agencies, North America, Q1 2019” report.</a>”

For its recent “<a href="https://reshapecxm.com/adobe-reshaping-cxm/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reshaping Customer Experience Management: The Future of #CXM</a>” campaign, *Adobe worked with TopRank Marketing to create a unique interactive online story featuring a wealth of helpful B2B influencer content to increase awareness of Adobe’s Customer Experience Management solutions.

The campaign combined expert insight from top industry experts including <a href="https://twitter.com/jaybaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay Baer</a> of Convince &amp; Convert, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarketingProfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ann Handley</a> of MarketingProfs, <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottMonty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Monty</a> of Scott Monty Strategies, <a href="https://twitter.com/RachelJRichter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Richter</a> of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and others, with enticing and useful interactive elements to bring Adobe’s CXM to life.

[bctt tweet="“Interactivity boosts content effectiveness no matter what your goals might be. Creating awareness, educating customers, driving leads, or attracting talent, content is more engaging when it invites the reader to play along.” @NiteWrites" username="toprank"]

Another recent <a href="https://twitter.com/toprank/status/1143528390571495425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll on our Twitter channel</a> asked B2B marketers which element offered the biggest performance increase potential in a blog post:

Interactive elements was the top choice in this informal poll, highlighting their power to drive engagement.

YouTube recently <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/youtube-launches-ar-virtual-try-on-capabilities-with-mac-cosmetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced new augmented reality (AR) advertising options</a>, which will be available later this summer through its influencer marketing platform, FameBit — an example of how the world’s largest video platform is expanding its use of interactive content elements.

Finally, here are three helpful interactive experience resources for marketers looking to begin or start utilizing the power of interactivity:

Content promotion fame isn’t in the stars for every campaign, however by using <strong>influencer co-creation</strong>, harnessing <strong>the power of events and trends</strong>, and incorporating <strong>smart re-purposing</strong> with <strong>engaging interactive elements</strong>, you’ll be that much closer to the red carpets of Cannes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-26700 aligncenter" src="https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/video-marketing-statistics.png" alt="Video Marketing Statistics for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey" width="600" height="350" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;It’s been said before, but I’ll say it again: Video across the digital landscape is what buyers and consumers alike crave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The average U.S. adult spends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/u-s-adults-now-spend-nearly-6-hours-per-day-watching-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;5 hours and 57 minutes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;a day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; watching video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. Compare that number to the average amount of time someone reads each day (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/americans-read-average-168-minutes-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;16.8 minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;), and you’ll find that people watch videos over 21-times longer than reading text. Video informs, engages, and entices audiences, which means video can and should have a place within your B2B content marketing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;But when and how should you leverage video? It’s not just a top-of-funnel tactic reserved for B2C brands. And here are the *stats that showcase it’s potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;15 Video Marketing Statistics for Every Stage of the Buyer Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Attract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;84% of marketers credit video with increasing traffic to their website. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;87% of people would like to see more video from brands. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;82% of all internet traffic will be video by 2021. (4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As we covered earlier, more and more people are spending an increasing amount of time watching video online. And that includes your buyers. For your marketing messages to capture and pull in your target audience, it needs to be in a place and in a format they prefer. Today, one of those important formats is video.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;From teaser videos to trailers, these video types are great for generating excitement and holding your audience’s attention, making them perfect for the awareness stage of the buyer journey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Here’s a little something from the TopRank Marketing vault, introducing a new interactive experience featuring insights from several marketing industry experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embed]https://youtu.be/ZMHSu-SYo8E[/embed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top-Performing Video Types:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Trailers, Teasers &amp;amp; Brand Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Engage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;People watch videos with subtitles 40% longer than videos without subtitles. (1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;52% of viewers watch a video all the way through. (2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;68% of people would rather watch a video to learn about a product or service rather than read about it. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;80% of marketers credit video with increasing the average time on page for their website. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;B2B videos can range from mere seconds in length to a full hour. Buyers in the engagement stage are likely considering their options, weighing potential solutions to their problem. Videos that explain how your products or services can solve problems are great for this stage. In addition, video reviews also help give your target audience the information they’re looking for, increasing engagement rates with your brand and videos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Here’s an example from **&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://delloutlet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Dell Outlet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, teasing the insights they’ve gathered from an array of small business experts and entrepreneurs on making smart tech purchases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FDellOutlet%2Fvideos%2F718505438609540%2F&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top-Performing Video Types:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Explainers, Reviews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Convert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;83% of marketers say video results in a good ROI. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;79% of people say a brand’s video convinced them to make a purchase. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;81% of marketers say video has helped them generate leads. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Including a video on a landing page can increase conversion rates by 80%. (6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Video is a great learning tool. In fact, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/how-to-spot-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-learni.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;approximately 65% of the global population&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; are visual learners. And the more your audience understands and is knowledgeable about your solution, the more likely they are to purchase it. Together, this makes video an excellent way to convince your audience of the value of your product or service. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What types of video are best for the conversion stage of the funnel? Live or on-demand webinars are an excellent way to give your target buyers an in-depth, detailed look at your solution and the benefits you offer. In addition, video testimonials from actual customers are an authentic way to communicate your brand’s value and why you’re a crucial partner across company types and industries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top-Performing Video Types:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Webinars, Testimonials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Retain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;41% of marketers say video has reduced their number of support calls. (3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;86% of viewers say they regularly turn to YouTube to learn something new. (5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The buyer journey doesn’t stop with a sale. Retention is just as important, if not more so considering the fact that it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;costs 5-times more to acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; a customer versus retain one. To help you hold on to your customer base, video is a great tool for continuing education and problem solving for your audience. Whether it’s a tutorial video or a video essay, videos are excellent education tools that keep your customers around longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;For example, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Salesforce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; provides several how-to and troubleshooting videos on its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbrOrrE0lOR2LcfycryZwHw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Salesforce Support YouTube&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; channel to make it easy for its customers to find solutions and guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2st8AdTUrsk[/embed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top-Performing Video Types: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Tutorials &amp;amp; Video Essays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Advocate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;74% of consumers share video content from brands on social media. (7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Videos receive 21.2% more interactions on Instagram compared to images and 18.6% more interactions compared to carousels. (7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Yes, marketers want to win new business and encourage return customers. However, another common item on a marketer’s wishlist is to transform buyers (and even employees) into raving fans that advocate for their company to fellow colleagues, peers, and partners. Given the virality of video content, especially on social networks, video marketing is a great opportunity for promoting advocacy within your audience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;To encourage greater advocacy through video, create videos that have the sole purpose of being watched and shared over social networks. These could be short, exciting videos that tease a new product launch or a video that highlights your company culture. Regardless of the topic, it’s important that the video contains something worth sharing and advocating about to others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top-Performing Video Types:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; Teasers, Trailers &amp;amp; Cultural Highlights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;In the Director’s Chair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There’s a reason why &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2019_B2B_Research_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;64% of B2B marketers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; increased the amount of video content they produced in 2019—it’s effective. And it’s effective across the buyer journey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;From attraction to conversion and beyond, video marketing brings B2B brands closer to their buyers. As the person in the director’s chair, now is the time to expand your video marketing (if you haven’t already).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What kind of videos should you be making? Check out our breakdown of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/06/types-b2b-video-marketing/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;four different types of B2B videos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; to learn which ones are best for your brand and marketing goals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been said before, but I’ll say it again: Video across the digital landscape is what buyers and consumers alike crave.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The average U.S. adult spends </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/u-s-adults-now-spend-nearly-6-hours-per-day-watching-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 hours and 57 minutes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a day</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> watching video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Compare that number to the average amount of time someone reads each day (</span><a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/americans-read-average-168-minutes-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16.8 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and you’ll find that people watch videos over 21-times longer than reading text. Video informs, engages, and entices audiences, which means video can and should have a place within your B2B content marketing strategy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But when and how should you leverage video? It’s not just a top-of-funnel tactic reserved for B2C brands. And here are the *stats that showcase it’s potential.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 Video Marketing Statistics for Every Stage of the Buyer Journey</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attract</span></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84% of marketers credit video with increasing traffic to their website. (3)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">87% of people would like to see more video from brands. (3)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">82% of all internet traffic will be video by 2021. (4)</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we covered earlier, more and more people are spending an increasing amount of time watching video online. And that includes your buyers. For your marketing messages to capture and pull in your target audience, it needs to be in a place and in a format they prefer. Today, one of those important formats is video.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From teaser videos to trailers, these video types are great for generating excitement and holding your audience’s attention, making them perfect for the awareness stage of the buyer journey.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a little something from the TopRank Marketing vault, introducing a new interactive experience featuring insights from several marketing industry experts.</span>

<b>Top-Performing Video Types:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trailers, Teasers &amp; Brand Video</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage</span></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People watch videos with subtitles 40% longer than videos without subtitles. (1)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">52% of viewers watch a video all the way through. (2)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">68% of people would rather watch a video to learn about a product or service rather than read about it. (3)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of marketers credit video with increasing the average time on page for their website. (3)</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B videos can range from mere seconds in length to a full hour. Buyers in the engagement stage are likely considering their options, weighing potential solutions to their problem. Videos that explain how your products or services can solve problems are great for this stage. In addition, video reviews also help give your target audience the information they’re looking for, increasing engagement rates with your brand and videos.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s an example from **</span><a href="http://delloutlet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dell Outlet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, teasing the insights they’ve gathered from an array of small business experts and entrepreneurs on making smart tech purchases.</span>

<b>Top-Performing Video Types:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Explainers, Reviews</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convert</span></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">83% of marketers say video results in a good ROI. (3)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">79% of people say a brand’s video convinced them to make a purchase. (3)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">81% of marketers say video has helped them generate leads. (3)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including a video on a landing page can increase conversion rates by 80%. (6)</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Video is a great learning tool. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/how-to-spot-visual-auditory-and-kinesthetic-learni.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approximately 65% of the global population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are visual learners. And the more your audience understands and is knowledgeable about your solution, the more likely they are to purchase it. Together, this makes video an excellent way to convince your audience of the value of your product or service. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of video are best for the conversion stage of the funnel? Live or on-demand webinars are an excellent way to give your target buyers an in-depth, detailed look at your solution and the benefits you offer. In addition, video testimonials from actual customers are an authentic way to communicate your brand’s value and why you’re a crucial partner across company types and industries. </span>

<b>Top-Performing Video Types:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Webinars, Testimonials</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retain</span></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41% of marketers say video has reduced their number of support calls. (3)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">86% of viewers say they regularly turn to YouTube to learn something new. (5)</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The buyer journey doesn’t stop with a sale. Retention is just as important, if not more so considering the fact that it </span><a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">costs 5-times more to acquire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a customer versus retain one. To help you hold on to your customer base, video is a great tool for continuing education and problem solving for your audience. Whether it’s a tutorial video or a video essay, videos are excellent education tools that keep your customers around longer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides several how-to and troubleshooting videos on its </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbrOrrE0lOR2LcfycryZwHw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Support YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channel to make it easy for its customers to find solutions and guidance.</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocate</span></h3>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of consumers share video content from brands on social media. (7)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos receive 21.2% more interactions on Instagram compared to images and 18.6% more interactions compared to carousels. (7)</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, marketers want to win new business and encourage return customers. However, another common item on a marketer’s wishlist is to transform buyers (and even employees) into raving fans that advocate for their company to fellow colleagues, peers, and partners. Given the virality of video content, especially on social networks, video marketing is a great opportunity for promoting advocacy within your audience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To encourage greater advocacy through video, create videos that have the sole purpose of being watched and shared over social networks. These could be short, exciting videos that tease a new product launch or a video that highlights your company culture. Regardless of the topic, it’s important that the video contains something worth sharing and advocating about to others.</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Director’s Chair</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason why </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2019_B2B_Research_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">64% of B2B marketers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased the amount of video content they produced in 2019—it’s effective. And it’s effective across the buyer journey. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From attraction to conversion and beyond, video marketing brings B2B brands closer to their buyers. As the person in the director’s chair, now is the time to expand your video marketing (if you haven’t already).</span>
